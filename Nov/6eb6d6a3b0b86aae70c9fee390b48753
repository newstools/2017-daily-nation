Governors painted Nyeri County red as they stepped out in red ties and scarfs when they came to pay their last respects to their colleague Wahome Gakuru at Kagumo High School Saturday. Men were wearing dark suits with red ties and women led by Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru wore a red scarf. It is not clear if that was agreed dress code or a mere coincidence. Even county chiefs who eschew suits like Kiambu’s Ferdinand Waititu  suited up and wore a greyish suit with a blue short and the matching red tie. Mr Waititu normally wears short-sleeved shirts and caps even during meetings with investors. By midday, more than 30 governors had arrived for the funeral service of the late Gakuru, which is currently being held at Kagumo High School.   President Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto are currently attending the funeral. The county chiefs also arrived in style using choppers and four-wheel drive vehicles.

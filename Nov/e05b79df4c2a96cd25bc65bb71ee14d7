IN LUANDA, ANGOLA Kenyan teams KPA and Equity Bank have a date with destiny when they take on formidable opposition on Friday in their Fiba Africa Champions Cup for women quarter-finals at Multiuso do Kilamba here in Luanda, Angola.  Equity have an uphill task of felling on form Primero de Agosto of Angola while KPA square it out with First Bank of Nigeria in matches scheduled to tip off at 2.45 pm and 4.45 pm Kenya time respectively.  GSP from Algeria gave Equity Bank a lifeline to the final eight after beating Vita-Club of the Democratic Republic of Congo 67-62 in a Pool A fixture. That result locked out the Congolese side from the championships and guaranteeing the Kenyan girls a fourth place finish and automatic advancement to the knock out stages. KPA women on the other hand needed no favours despite losing 68-34 to Ferravierio of Maputo in their final Pool B match on Thursday.  The dockers did not execute well offensively and lacked consistency on defense allowing their opponents open shots.  Betty Kananu scored nine points and Seline Okumu added eight in a losing effort in this game that saw KPA’s point guard Natalie Akinyi carried off the court at halftime after colliding with Vega Veronica, an Argentine player featuring for the Mozambican club.

The National Disaster Operation Centre Desk Officer Jonathan Mr Kertich has said that divers taking part in the search for three remaining bodies in the Lake Nakuru helicopter crash have located something believed to be the chopper. Mr Kertich Friday said divers brought with them parts that are believed to be those of the chopper. "The parts are highly likely to be [those] of the chopper but we have to be sure because there is a time we had an equipment that turned out to be something else," said Mr Kertich. He said the divers had gone back to the water with experts to confirm what they saw.   MORE TOOLS "Once it is confirmed that it is actually the wreckage of the chopper, more equipment will be sent into the lake for retrieval," he added. He called for patience as the officers continue with the operation. However, journalists were locked outside the Lake Nakuru National Park entrance. A warden at the gates who denied journalists access into the lake said they were following orders from above. Rift Valley Regional Coordinator Wanyama Musiambo also arrived at the recovery scene. Mr Musiambo said they needed to confirm what had been located before members of the public are informed.   Tools include side scan sonar, a multi-beam echo sound and marine magnetometer.

Former Commission on Implementation of the Constitution Chairman Charles Nyachae is among Jubilee Party’s nominees to the East African Legislative Assembly (Eala). The list presented to the House on Thursday by National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen is dominated by MPs who lost in the August 8 General Election. Other notable names on the list of 15 include former Clerk of the National Assembly Justin Bundi, who also previously served as clerk of the regional assembly. Others battling for the party’s five seats are former MPs Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua), Mpuri Aburi (Tigania East), Aden Noor (Mandera North), Simon Mbugua (Kamukunji) and Abdulaziz Fara (Mandera). Mr Duale said the final list was arrived at in a meeting that was chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "Our list has taken into consideration regional and gender balance. It is now upon the committee to deal with the candidates individually," he said. Jubilee received 111 applicants, Nasa 58, other parties 15 while 15 people applied as independent candidates.

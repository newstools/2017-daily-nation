Some Ugandan MPs have rejected the cash released by Parliament to facilitate consultations on a bill seeking to scrap presidential age limit. So far, 10 lawmakers have rejected the millions of shillings, with the latest one being Leader of Opposition in Parliament Winnie Kiiza. 'BRIBE' Ms Kiiza, the Kasese Woman MP, on Thursday returned USh29 million to Parliament in Kampala. She said she delayed returning the money because she was out of the country. Also returning the cash was Rukungiri Municipality MP Roland Kaginda, who said his voters asked him not to step in constituency before rejecting what they called “a bribe”. "We have different voters. My voters do not want me to even touch this money, " Mr Kaginda said. The money is part of the USh13 billion released by Parliament last month to facilitate consultations on the bill initiated by Igara West MP Raphael Magyezi. The bill, among others, seeks to repeal Article 120(b) of the Ugandan Constitution to lift the presidential age limit. MUSEVENI The proposed change has been widely criticised as a move to pave way for President Museveni's ascendency to a life president. Mr Kaginda told the Monitor that he has to follow the will of his people. "We definitely do not need to waste tax payers’ money. I’m sure that, just like my voters, this is a bribe," Mr Kaginda said. Parliament has since come public, owning the money as nothing short of facilitation. The two legislators  join eight others who have flatly turned down the cash offer. They include Medard Segona (DP-Busiro South), Angeline Osegge (FDC Soroti), Moses Kasibante (Ind-Rubaga North), William Nzoghu (FDC-Busingora North) and Mohammed Muwanga Kivumbi (DP-Butambala County.) Others are Kiira Municipality MP Ibrahim Ssemujju (FDC), his Kyaddondo East counterpart Robert Kyagulanyi and Masaka Municipality MP Matthias Mpuuga.

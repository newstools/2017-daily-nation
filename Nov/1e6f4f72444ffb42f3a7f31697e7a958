Most of the schools in insecurity-prone parts of the North Rift region defied all the odds to post impressive results. The schools in Baringo, West Pokot, Elgeyo-Marakwet and Turkana counties had some candidates scoring more than 400 marks, an improvement compared to last year. In Turkana, Steven Lotiam, a South Sudanese who sat the exam at Erait Academy, scored 418 marks. The school registered 66 candidates, with five scoring above 400 marks. BANDITSElizabeth Nzioka Mbenge, who aspires to be a journalist, got 406 marks. At the neighbouring Turkana Blooms Academy, Losero Philly scored 412 marks. In West Pokot, where learning at some schools was often disrupted by bandit attacks, girls performed better than boys. Top candidate Leah Chepkemoi from Modern Day Light Academy scored 421 and Vivian Chepkech Kapelion of Kapenguria Town View Academy 418. Other top performers are Enock Powon of Day Light Academy (416), Vibian Rialem of Jerusalem Academy (413) and Patience Chepkupus of Jerusalem Academy (411).

LONDON Everton have appointed former England manager Sam Allardyce as their new manager on an 18-month contract, the English Premier League club announced Thursday. Allardyce, previously also in charge of Bolton, Newcastle, Sunderland and Crystal Palace, will take charge of the Merseysiders for the first time when they welcome Huddersfield Town for a league match at Goodison Park on Saturday. "I've always thought Everton was a great club," Allardyce said in a club statement.  "Obviously, the club has gone through a difficult spell and hopefully I can put that behind us as quickly as possible and start looking upwards again."

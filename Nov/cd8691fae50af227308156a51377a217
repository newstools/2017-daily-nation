Vaell, an equipment leasing services firm, has signed a partnership with Hello Tractors to help farmers easily access farm machinery. The partnership is expected to boost the two firms service provision to farmers.  “This partnership with Hello Tractor is a firm step to building our foundation and becoming a leader in this business model. Hello Tractor is the perfect partner to help us fully realise this prospect in the long term,” said Vaell’s managing director Paul Njeru. Jehiel Oliver, the CEO of Hello Tractor, an online platform, said while equipment ownership is not practical for the majority of farmers across Africa, Vaell has emerged as the established leader in providing smart equipment leasing support in the region.  “Together, Hello Tractor and Vaell will create solutions that will effectively reshape the landscape of equipment availability across the region,” Oliver noted. With Vaell’s expansion across the East Africa region, the partnership will ensure access to fleet management and scheduling technologies, making it easy for farmers to get whatever equipment they need for their farming productivity. “We view this partnership as a game changer for farmers and the wider market,” said Njeru. 
  
Some banks have also come in, offering farmers up to 80 percent financing making it possible for them to purchase machinery.

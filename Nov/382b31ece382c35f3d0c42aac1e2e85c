A Kenya Defence Forces soldier and a General Service Unit officer were among those injured during an Al-Shabaab attack in Lamu on Tuesday, police say. Two Administration Police officers were killed in the attack after the militants ambushed an escort vehicle they were travelling in Lango La Simba in Nyongoro, along the Lamu-Malindi road. FALSE NEWS Coast police boss Larry Kieng dismissed reports circulating on social media that dozens of solders died in the attack.  In an interview with the Nation, Mr Kieng said three APs who were in the vehicle also injured. “KDF and GSU officers responded to the attack and two of them were injured,” Mr Kieng said. Mr Kieng cautioned those spreading false information saying investigations are underway. "The law will catch up with them,” Mr Kieng said He added that a major hunt for the attackers is ongoing.  The attackers, who were dressed in jungle military uniform, distributed leaflets to the passengers but did not harm them. A passenger who talked to the Nation said the militants entered in the buses and started distributing leaflets written “We won’t retreat. Our target is the government”. On Wednesday, questions were raised why only five APs in one vehicle were assigned to escort five buses in the terror prone route. ENOUGH SECURITY However, Boni Enclave Campaign Director Joseph Kanyiri said “enough” security officers were escorting the passenger buses when the attack occured.  Mr Kanyiri said the general security along the road had also been intensified especially at Nyongoro area and its environs. This is not the first attack on passenger buses and vehicles plying the Lamu-Garsen by suspected Al-Shabaab militants. On August 30 this year, an occupant of a Toyota Probox and a driver of a lorry were killed at Gamba near Nyongoro in Witu, Lamu West when their vehicles were sprayed with bullets by suspected Al-Shabaab militants.

A government decision to scrap fees for students in day secondary schools is a step in the right direction, and long overdue. It will open doors to millions of students who have been locked out by the high fees in both boarding and day schools. Indeed, education experts have all along called for the injection of more resources into day schools because they have been proved to offer better and more stress-free learning environments that boarding institutions. While spelling out guidelines for next yearâ€™s schooling calendar on Tuesday, Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said day scholars will only be required to pay for uniforms and lunch. However, the directive, though timely, is fraught with risks and weaknesses that might make it counterproductive. In the first place, the government seems to be putting the cart before the horse as it has not laid down the basic requirements to make the system work. Secondary schools have been hit by an acute staffing shortage running up to about 60,000 teachers. Classrooms, laboratories and libraries have not been expanded or sufficiently equipped to cater for the anticipated increased enrolment. The government must hire more teachers and expand facilities before opening doors to students. Failure to do that will just compromise quality and render the free education useless.

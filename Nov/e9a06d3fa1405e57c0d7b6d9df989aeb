A strong lock with keys  that are hard to duplicate are important for the security of any premises, so it is worth investing in good quality locks, even though they are expensive. A main door lock should have a minimum of four levers (flat pieces of metal), and the higher the lever count, the greater the lock’s security. Go for keys that are difficult to copy to avoid unauthorised duplication. When buying a lock, choose one with high-security feature keys. If you buy or move into a new house, be very careful since you cannot tell whether the contractor’s workers or servant(s) of the former occupant have duplicate keys. If you cannot buy new locks immediately, swap those of the inner doors with those of the outer doors as a minimal precaution. Take special care of your keys and duplicates; give them only to a trustworthy employee and have them sign for it so that they can  hold them to account. Nowadays you can fit biometric (fingerprint) locks on important doors since they offer better security than conventional locks. There are also locks that you can link with your mobile phone via Bluetooth with a PIN code to control access. If you fit padlocks, avoid the spring type that can easily be picked, and protect padlocks at the entry with a steel casing to make it difficult to cut. Deadlocks (a lock that is opened using a key) or rim bolt locks are recommended for the main door of flats and houses because they cannot be pushed open. But the condition of your door also matters. In many cases, break-ins and robberies are made easy by weak doors ot poor installation, so make sure your door is strong and that its frame is firmly fixed to the wall. For enhanced security, you can install a fully automatic intruder alarm system that operates even when you are away.              Jeremy Van Tongeren is the deputy chairman, SGA, which specialises in security equipment

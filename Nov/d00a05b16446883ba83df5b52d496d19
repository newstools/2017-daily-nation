A lobby wants opposition leaders who intend to swear in former Prime Minister Raila Odinga purportedly as president even after he lost the August 8 election and refused to participate in the presidential poll re-run of October 26 arrested and dealt with in accordance with the law. Mount Kenya Youth Caucus, through its chairman Linford Mutembei, said such an activity was unconstitutional and should not be allowed.  Only President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto should be sworn in, having been elected on October 26, he said. “Any other planned swearing-in is illegal and should not be allowed to take place,” Mr Mutembei said yesterday. “Those who intend to undertake such an activity should be put behind bars and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the law.” Those behind the plans were only trying to cover themselves from the shame of having misled the former premier not to participate in the repeat poll, Mr Mutembei added. “Even Nasa leaders know that their move is inconsequential,” said Mr Mutembei.  “They are just seeking some relevance and to hide their mistakes of misleading Odinga to boycott the election thinking things would go their way.”

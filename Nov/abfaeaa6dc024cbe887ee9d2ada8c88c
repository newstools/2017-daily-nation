Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) is once again set to revise its schedule to enable commuters travelling to Nairobi’s central business district from Syokimau to arrive at work on time. Under the new schedule expected to be effected starting December 1, trains will be leaving Syokimau station at 6.40am to arrive in the CBD at 7.27am. A second train will leave Syokimau station at 7.40am to arrive at the Nairobi terminus at 8.27am. “People would like to arrive early at their final destinations. It is expected that with this change Mombasa travellers will be able to travel earlier when roads are less busy.  The return trip will also allow them to arrive early. We shall keep reviewing these schedules to accommodate the needs of customers,” said Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina. Passengers have been leaving Syokimau terminus at 6.30am to arrive at the Nairobi station at 7.15am. A second train has been departing Syokimau station at 7.40am and arriving at the Nairobi terminus at 8.27am.  “It’s for convenience of passengers,” said Mr Maina. In the adjustment, the first train in the afternoon will leave the Nairobi terminus at 12pm and arrive at Syokimau at 12:50pm. The second will leave Nairobi station at 17.50pm and arrive in Syokimau at 18.37pm.

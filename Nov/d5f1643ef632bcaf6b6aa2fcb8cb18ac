Ward representatives in Kiambu County are set to manage Sh9 billion in the five years they will be in office. In an arrangement similar to the National Government Constituency Development Fund, which is patronised by MPs, the MCAs will have their own fund. Governor Ferdinand Waititu said his administration, through the regional assembly, intended to enact legislation that will create the County Ward Development Fund which will be headed by MCAs with a view to decentralising development and ensuring equitable sharing of resources among the wards. According to Mr Waititu, each of the wards will be getting an estimated Sh30 million per year, and each will have a ward development committee comprising selected representatives in the area who will be managing the kitty. The county has 60 wards, and with each of them getting Sh30 million annual allocation, it means the kitty will be getting Sh1.8 billion per year and for the five years the MCAs will be in office, they will manage Sh9 billion. Mr Waititu also said his administration had abolished the positions of ward administrators.

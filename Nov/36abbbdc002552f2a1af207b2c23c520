World 800m bronze medallist Kipyegon Bett is set to launch his season at the second leg of the Athletics Kenya Track and Field championships planned for Friday at Kisii University. Also set for Kisii is the 2016 Diamond League Series 800m winner Ferguson Rotich and World Under-18 2,000 steeplechase champion Leonard Bett and 5,000m specialist David Bett. Kipyegon will compete in the 400m, while it's not known which event Rotich will take part in. David will field in his specialty. "I am ready for the Kisii event but will be going for the one lap race," said Kipyegon, who won bronze at the World Championships in London in August. Kipyegon, who is the World Under-20 800m champion, said he is looking forward for his debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in April 4 -15 in Gold Coast, Australia. "I am pleased with my progress, winning silver at World Under-18, before upgrading to gold at World Under-20. Bronze in London was still excellent for me," said Kipyegon. Bett joins World 5000m champion Hellen Obiri on the list of medallist from London. Obiri, the 2013 World 1,500 bronze medallist, will juggle between 1500m and 5000m. The women's Africa 5000m champion Sheila Chepkirui is expected in Kisii, where she hopes to later get a ticket to the Commonwealth Games. Africa Cross Country Under-20 champion Miriam Cherop will take a shot in 5000m, having won the Sotik leg of the AK Cross Country Series.

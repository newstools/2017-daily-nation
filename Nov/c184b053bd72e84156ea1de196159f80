A KCSE candidate from Witharaga Mixed Secondary School in Suna East, Migori County, has gone missing a few days before the end of the national exam. Martin Odhiambo went missing on Tuesday evening while on his way home from school after his night studies. ‘ABDUCTED’ Principal Gideon Odhiambo told journalists who visited school that they received information from another candidate that the missing student sent her a text message alleging he had been abducted. “I am also following reports from his friend that the missing candidate was abducted [and forced] into a Probox car that was driven to Ogwedhi, about 10km away from his home,” Mr Odhiambo said. The principal added that Martin was one of the best candidates in the school and the school had high hopes of him excelling in the exam. Martin missed his Christian Religious Education paper two that he was to sit for on Wednesday, said Mr Odhiambo. INVESTIGATION He said the alleged abduction was reported to the police. Migori County criminal investigation officer Benedict Kigen said police are aware of the incident and have launched investigations. The student’s mother Susan Adoyo Odhiambo said her son left home at 8pm on Tuesday and never came back. She said she was informed of her son’s alleged abduction by the candidate to whom Martin allegedly sent the message. Mr Samwel Owino, a neighbour, said Martin usually went for night studies as his home does not have electricity, but he has been missing since Tuesday night. 
  
Last year, 574,125 candidates sat the examination in 9,154 centres.

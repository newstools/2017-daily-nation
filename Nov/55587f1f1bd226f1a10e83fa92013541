A supervisor and invigilators at Musingu Secondary School in Kakamega County have been replaced after unauthorised scripts were sneaked into an examination room on Tuesday. Two candidates at the school and 17 officials supervising the exam will record statements with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over the incident. UNMANNED Officials of the Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) made a surprise visit to the school and found exam rooms unmanned by invigilators and security officers. They got suspicious after they noticed two candidates in one of the exam rooms sitting close to each other and appeared to be comparing notes while the Kiswahili Paper 3 exam was in progress. One candidate then threw a booklet out of a window. A Knec official, who declined to give her name, said she had briefed Knec chairman George Magoha about the incident. “You will forgive me, since I’m not authorised to speak to the media. You can contact Prof Magoha who has the information,” said the official. REPLACED The Knec officials managed to recover the scripts and questioned two invigilators who had left the exam rooms unattended. They said police officers were asked to stay away from exam rooms to avoid scaring the candidates while they were sitting the exam. Western region coordinator Mongo Chimwaga and regional police coordinator Moses Ombati visited the school and ordered for replacement of the exam supervisors and invigilators and the security officers deployed to the institution. INVESTIGATION “We cannot allow such laxity to take place at the school while the exams are in progress,” said Mr Chimwaga. He said there were anomalies related to the supervision of the exam, which had been detected and were being addressed. The Kakamega County investigation officer David Cheruiyot is leading the investigations.   CS Matiangi fires 2 invigilators at Aga Khan High School, Nairobi.

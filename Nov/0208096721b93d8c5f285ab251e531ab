Three men linked to the theft of more than Sh50 million from Thika KCB Bank branch have been released on bond. Halford Munene Murakaru, 32, his brother Charles Mwangi Murakaru, 30, and their friend Julius Ndungu Wainaina, 32, where released on a bond of Sh4 million each and a surety of the same amount by Thika Chief Magistrate Teresia Murigi. DETAIN The three were granted bond after police failed to give evidence to support their application seeking to have the suspects detained for more days. Police arrested the suspects at Joyland estate in Juja on Saturday, where they also found Sh17.1 million in one of the houses. The three, jointly with others still at large, were accused of breaking and entering the bank through an underground tunnel and stealing Sh52.65 million. The money included 17,135,000 Kenyan shillings, 1,311 US dollars, 340 Great British pounds, 5 Canadian dollars, 85 Australia dollars, 46,000 Tanzania shillings, 40 South Africa rand and 20,000 Ugandan shillings. They appeared in court on Monday and denied charges. EVIDENCE  The prosecution, led by State Counsel Stella Oyagi asked the court to have the suspects detained on grounds that they were likely to interfere with the case if released and that they were likely to flee. Ms Oyagi said reliable reports indicated that before their arrest, they were planning to leave the country. But, in her ruling, Ms Murigi said the prosecution did not give enough evidence to support their claims. The case will be mentioned on December 14, and the full hearing is expected to start on March 29.Â

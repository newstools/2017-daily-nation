A KCSE candidate from Witharaga Mixed Secondary School in Suna East, Migori County who went missing on Tuesday evening has been found. The young man was found alive in a sugarcane plantation at Oyuma village. His uncle, Daniel Oketch, said he was found inside the cane plantation in a “distressed condition” on Friday morning. Mr Oketch said he was alerted cane cutters from the village that they had found somebody inside the sugarcane plantation. "We were excited to find that it was the boy," said Mr Okech. He added that the student could not be able to talk and express himself immediately as he looked tired and hungry.  CHECK-UP Migori County police boss Joseph Nthenge confirmed on phone that the student was found alive and is ready to continue with the examinations. The student was taken to Migori County Referral Hospital for check-up before he went back to school.  The principal of the school Gideon Odhiambo said the student is ready to do his remaining examination papers of Chemistry and Biology but his fate on a test he missed on Wednesday is yet to be addressed by exam officials. "The student will continue with the remaining paper but we do not know what the Kenya National Examination Council will do to help him with the missed exams," said Mr Odhiambo, adding that they have embarked on guiding and counselling the boy. The student went missing on Tuesday evening while he was on his way home from school. 
  
He allegedly sent a text message to another student, saying he was abducted.

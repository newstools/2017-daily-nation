Tea production in the nine months to September dropped 12 per cent on account of severe drought witnessed particularly in the first quarter of the year. Monthly data from Tea Directorate indicate the volumes dropped to 303 million kilogrammes (kg) between January and September from 346 million in the corresponding period last year. “The decline is attributed to unfavorable weather conditions that was experienced during the first quarter of the year,” says the report. The production decline affected export volumes with quantities sold through the Mombasa auction shrinking by 17 per cent, to 320 million kgs in the period under review, from 387 million kgs between January and September 2016. Reduced supplies at the auction helped to boost price of tea in the international markets, where Kenya sells over 90 per cent of its beverage, making it the leading exporter of the commodity. Cumulative average price for the nine months of 2017 was on average higher at Sh306 per Kg compared with Sh236 for the corresponding period of 2016. “Improved prices were attributable to good demand against lower supply of tea in the first quarter of the year when the country witnessed a decline in production,” says the report.

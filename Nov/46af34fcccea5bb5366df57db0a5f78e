A man was hacked to death in his relative's house on Sunday in Gandini Village, Gandini Location, Kwale County. Mr Begari Mongolo, 62, was asleep when he was attacked at 5am in the house. He was alone at the time. PANGA CUTS Mr Mongolo, who is from Dzivani Village, was in Gandini to attend the 40th day memorial ceremony marked by Muslims after a burial. Gandini Chief Umazi Mwangolo said the man had deep panga cuts. “He was a respected man who never provoked anyone,” the chief said. "We are shocked to witness such a heartless killing. What we understand is that he was killed using a panga, but we are waiting for a medical report as investigations are ongoing," she said. MISTAKEN IDENTITY? Ms Mwangolo condemned the incident and warned residents against crime. She said the motive of the murder is still unclear but speculated that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity. Kinango OCPD Fredrick Lai said police have been dispatched to the area and were pursuing useful leads. Police took the body to Kinango Hospital mortuary.

The bodies of three fishermen, including a Tanzanian, who drowned in Lake Victoria near Sindo Beach in Suba South Sub-County after their boat capsized on Sunday have been retrieved. The body of Joseph Juma Kasosi, 33, and a Tanzanian, Nyang'ope Jashirati aged 30, were found floating at the nearby Litare Beach in Rusinga Island by fellow fishermen. According to Sindo Beach Management Unit Chairman Patroba Okenge, the bodies were recovered after an intensive operation which was launched on Monday. "We had a joint effort in the search operation. This is the reason we've been successful in getting the bodies," said Mr Patroba. SEARCH CONTINUES He said the search for the third body of Martin Kenneth, 41, is still on. Mr Patroba said that the two bodies which were recovered will remain at the beach until the third body is found. "We are going to keep the retrieved bodies in the water until we get the remaining body. This is according to the Luo traditions," he said. Homa Bay County Beach Management Network Chairman Edward Oremo cautioned fishermen against going into the lake without proper life-saving gear so as to avoid more deaths. Mr Oremo also appealed to the county government of Homa Bay to provide life jackets to fishermen operating in Lake Victoria. "We can avoid such incidents if we are provided with life-saving jackets," said Mr Oremo.

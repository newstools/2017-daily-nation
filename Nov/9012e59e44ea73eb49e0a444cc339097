A doctor accused of murdering a Kenya Revenue Authority lawyer has written to the Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko requesting a plea bargain. David Muchiri Mwangi, who is accused of killing Jared Ratemo Mokua, told Justice Jessie Lesiit that he is yet to get a response from Mr Tobiko. Assistant DPP Catherine Mwaniki asked the court to postpone the case for one month, as Mr Tobiko considers the request. Dr Mwangi, the owner of Fig Tree Medical Centre based in Ngara, has denied murdering Mr Ratemo, an offence he allegedly committed on July 11, 2017. The lawyer was abducted and went missing before his body was discovered dumped on Mombasa Road. Law Society of Kenya opposed the release of the suspect on bail. Justice Lesiit directed the case to be mentioned on December 4. A plea bargain— also called a plea deal— is an agreement in a criminal case between the prosecutor and defendant whereby the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a particular charge in return for some concession from the prosecutor.   He was tortured, injected with an unknown substance and strangled, post-mortem shows.

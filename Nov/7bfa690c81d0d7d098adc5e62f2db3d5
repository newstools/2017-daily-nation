Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o on Saturday launched the Sh98 million relocation of Kachok dumpsite that has been a health hazard to the residents. Prof Nyong’o exuded confidence that the initiative will help reduce pollution in Kisumu Town. "Everyone is aware of the effects this dumpsite has created here and I want Kisumu residents to know this is the beginning of the journey in ensuring that we have a clean environment. "When [we] took over the leadership of the county, we had promised to begin the eradication of the dumpsite in 100 days and I am glad we are doing that today," he said. POLLUTION About 80 trucks will be used to transport the waste to a five-acre quarry in Kajulu ward. The relocation is expected to take three months. Kachok dumpsite, which is situated near residential areas and is a major cause of pollution in Lake Victoria, has been a subject of debate with former governor Jack Ranguma facing criticism for failing to adequately solve the matter. PRIORITYThe Football Kenya Federation had also threatened to ban the use of the multibillion Moi Stadium if the waste is not removed. During his inauguration, Prof Nyong'o listed the relocation among his 10-point plan. Governor Nyong’o was joined by Senator Fred Outa, Speaker Onyango Oloo and a host of other leaders during the commissioning.

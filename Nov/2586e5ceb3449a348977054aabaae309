World 800metres record holder David Rudisha on Friday pulled a stunt pretending he injured himself while training at the Silver Springs, Nairobi. "I have just gotten acute appendicitis have to cut training short. Headed to the hospital in a swift ambulance," Rudisha tweeted. Footage showing him alight from the ambulance and jogging to the hospital due to heavy traffic along Ngong Road was shown on a local television. He later tweeted saying it was all a stunt to highlight the need for better emergency response. "This was a stunt by @emergencymedke @chapter1KE @18HoursFilm to highlight need for better emergency response."

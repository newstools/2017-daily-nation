Seed Trade Association of Kenya (Stak) and the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (Kephis) have partnered with a global technology firm to boost access to quality seeds. The two partnered with mPedigree to enhance tracking of the farm inputs to combat fakes. Duncan Onduu, the chief executive of Stak, said technology is key in the fight against fakes.  “Alongside Kephis and our other partners, we stress the involvement of technology in the seed sector to ensure it flourishes, even as climate change takes its toll on agriculture,” he said during Stak’s Congress, Expo and Mazao Forum this week. Dr Gyanendra Shukla, the CEO of Monsanto Africa, noted the seed sector must be modernised and technology used to boost agricultural yields. “The seed sector must be supported by technology to ensure farmers only get the best,” said Dr Shukla. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett assured farmers that emphasis is being given to the improvement of research to adequately respond to the needs of smallholder farmers.

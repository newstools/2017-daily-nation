Ulinzi Stars forward Stephen Waruru has quit the soldiers, club chairman Lt. Col Eric Oloo has confirmed. Oloo wished the player well as he ventures into a new journey with reports already linking him to 11-time SportPesa Premier League (SPL) champions Tusker. “Waruru resigned from the force. Having served us well for the past nine years, the least we can offer him is total support in his future endeavours,” Oloo told Nation Sport on Friday. The striker, who scored 13 goals in 19 games in the just concluded season, was grateful to the entire Ulinzi fraternity for their support during his spell at the Nakuru-based side. “I loved the team and I thank my teammates and the entire technical bench for their massive support. For now my tour of duty at Ulinzi Stars is over but I am still in the football industry. “For the moment my focus is on the upcoming international assignment thereafter will reveal my future club," said the Kenyan international, who is among 26 players summoned for the Council of East and Central Africa Football Association (Cecafa) Senior Challenge Cup tourney. The four-time champions could also lose the services of speedy winger Samuel Onyango who has been heavily linked to champions Gor Mahia. The player, Nation Sport understands, is in the process of tendering in his resignation with Oloo non-committal on the reports. “I have heard the rumours but if Gor are interested, they know the procedures.”

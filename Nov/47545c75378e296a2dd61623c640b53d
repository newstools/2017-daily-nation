Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup champions Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) will face holders Impala Saracens in Floodlit final on Saturday next week. The bankers and the Sarries set up a replay of last year's final when they dismissed their opponents in closely contested semi-finals at the Impala Sports Club grounds on Saturday. KCB needed Ken Moseti's drop goal in the dying moments to edge out Homeboyz 18-16 in the rain-drenched match. Anxious moments gripped the duel when Homeboyz got a penalty almost centre field just before the hooter but man-of-the-match Mohammed Omollo's kick fell short as the bankers eased through. On the first semi, Impala Saracens battled to beat the University of Nairobi's Mean Machine 20-10. ONGO STARS  Winger Quinton Ongo converted his own try and a penalty as substitute Mark Kwemoi chalked a drop goal for Impala, who also got a penalty try to outclass the students. Substitute Valentine Odoyo converted his own try with fullback Eric Muthama managing a penalty but all was in vain for Machine, who were chasing their first title since 2011. "We played on gear one for the whole match. I was trying out new combinations and the systems this being our first match of the season," said Impala coach Frank Ndong, who reckoned that they still have work to do. He expects a highly physical final hence called on his forwards to prepare for a big clash against Kenya Commercial Bank. "It will be a long day for us hence my forwards will need to wake up," said Ndong'. Machine skipper Shadon Munoko said even though some technicalities were his charges' main undoing, he was still proud of the team.  "We had some lapses after we levelled but the good thing is that Machine's good attitude is still there," said Munoko.  Machine were relegated to the Championship event after a poor run in the Kenya Cup last season.  "We shall win the Championship unbeaten and return to Kenya Cup," said Munoko.

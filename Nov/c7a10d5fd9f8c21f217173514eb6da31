Zetech University recovered to beat Co-operative Bank 54-50 in Game Two of Kenya Basketball Federation women’s Premier League play-offs quarter-final at Africa Nazarene University Gymnasium Saturday. The victory saw Zetech, who had lost 43-44 to Co-op Bank in the opener, lock the best-of-three series 1-1 to leave Sunday’s Game Three to decide the team to qualify for the semi-final.  Zetech coach Morris Obilo said: “We are a young team with a bulk of inexperienced high school players. Winning today has motivated us to fight harder and reach the semi-finals.’’ On Saturday, forward Debora Atieno and Lucy Musyoki led the university students to a deserved 14-10 first quarter run as the bankers worked hard to level the scores.  Co-op Bank, who finished third in the regular season with 30 points to advance, saw veterans Everline Itabu and Florence Mbithe tame Zetech’s offensive players. Co-op Bank raced to a 15-6 second quarter lead and their tight defence ensured that they remain ahead 25-20 at half-time. Coach Obilo’s Zetech led 10-15 at the end of the third quarter. Determined to write history by qualifying for their first semi-final, Zetech overpowered Co-op Bank with a huge 24-17 fourth quarter run which enabled the students to escape a 2-0 embarrassment.  Debora Atieno scored 16 points, while Lucy Musyoki sunk nine for Zetech. The make-or-break Game Three starts at 1pm at the same venue.

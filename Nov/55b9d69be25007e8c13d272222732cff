Governors have resolved to traverse the country preaching peace after the just-concluded elections. Speaking Thursday in Nyandarua County during the funeral of Fr Wachira Kimemia, a brother of Governor Francis Kimemia, governors Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Ferdinand Waititu (Kiambu) and Mr Kimemia said the country is heavily polarised after the October 26 repeat presidential election. “We as governors under the Council of Governors have resolved to set aside our political differences. “We are going to transverse the country preaching peace starting with Nyanza and Western regions,” said Governor Kinyanjui. “We need to move together as a country and no single county can make it on its own. We assure you that as governors we are united,” he stated. Mr Kinyanjui said that the 47 governors will work together in development, complementing each other and forming of economic blocks irrespective of their political affiliations. “We do not want to repeat the mistake made by former governors. We have resolved to work as a team, complimenting each other to help bring development to our people,” said Mr Kinyanjui. Mr Waititu said Raila should be held responsible for deaths and destruction of property witnessed during and after the elections. “People should stop taking Raila seriously. His aim is to confuse his running mate and other Nasa principals so that they can forget about power sharing and election deals they made before the elections. President Uhuru Kenyatta should not negotiate with Raila,” said Mr Waititu. He said the opposition leader should quit active politics and stop using threats and intimidation to get a share of the government.

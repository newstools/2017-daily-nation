A High Court judge presiding overÂ a petition filed against Trans-Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has revealed that unknown individuals have threatened and attempted to bribe him. Justice Anthony Mrima on Tuesday warned both parties and counsels in the petition that he will not be intimidated by anybody, and that he will decide the case filed by two voters according to the law. "I have noted that there has been acts of threats on court. I have been threatened and even written letters," said Justice Mrima. Justice Mrima, without mentioning names, added that there have been concerted attempts to bribe him in order to rule in favour of one party. "My message is very clear and let it go down to everybody I will decide this case on the basis of Law and evidence and I will not be intimidated by anybody," he warned. PETITION  The two voters, Robinson Simiyu Mwanga and Alpha Kitazi Chore, filed the petition on October 9 challenging Mr Khaemba's poll victory. The two felt that the Jubilee gubernatorial candidate Maurice Bisau's votes were stolen in favour of Mr Khaemba. Mr Khaemba of Ford Kenya garnered 135, 345 votes while Bisau got 92, 561 votes. During the Tuesday sitting, lawyer Wanyonge Wanyama for Mr Khaemba opposed an application by lawyer Mureithi Gitonga for the two voters to scrutinise ballot boxes. The petitioners also wanted the judge to order a vote re-count. Justice Mrima will rule on the matter on December 7 at 9 am. Last week, Siaya High Court Judge Esther Maina vowed not to bend the law and give an unfair ruling in the election petition challenging the victory of Governor Cornel Rasanga. Justice Maina warned anyone who might attempt to bribe her to rule in their favour in the case filed by former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo of dire consequences.

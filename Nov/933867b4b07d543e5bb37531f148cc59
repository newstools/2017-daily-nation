A man has been shot dead in Migori Town during protests that followed the Supreme Court ruling that upheld the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta on October 26.  He was killed near a hotel in the town as he crossed the Migori-Tanzania road which had been blocked by protestors. Reports indicated that the victim, identified only as Mandela, was not part of the demonstrations and was going about his personal errands. â€œA policeman known to us shot him on the lower abdomen even as he raised both hands in submission," a witness claimed. After the shooting, the victim was rushed to Oruba Nursing Home where he was pronounced dead on arrival. County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge said they had launched investigations into the circumstances of the shooting.

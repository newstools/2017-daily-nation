President Uhuru Kenyatta has put on notice Nasa leaders following chaos that rocked the return of their Raila Odinga on Friday, saying his government will not tolerate violence.  Mr Kenyatta, while speaking during the funeral service of former Nyeri Governor Wahome Gakuru, said that he will not allow "few people to destroy the country". "We have a constitution and we are a nation that is governed by the rule of law and we must abide by it. Asking people to abide by it is not going overboard," he said.  ELECTION Mr Kenyatta said that he is also not above the law, noting that he respected the Supreme Court decision that nullified his August 8 election win and ordered a rerun.  "Even myself as President I followed the law [even though] I felt I had been wronged," he said. Five people were confirmed dead in the Friday chaos in Nairobi as Nasa supporters who were welcoming their leader's, Mr Odinga, arrival from the US confronted anti-riot police officers. SECURITY Appealing to Kenyans to be peaceful, Deputy President William Ruto accused Nasa of using intimidation and violence to grab power.  "The people who think they can use intimidation and violence to further their political agenda will not succeed. We will never succumb to intimidation or blackmail," he said.  Mr Ruto said the government will protect the lives and property of Kenyans.  "This country is too important to be left in the hands of people who believe in chaos and bloodshed." 
  
Nasa politician Johnstone Muthama claimed eight other people suffered gunshot wounds.

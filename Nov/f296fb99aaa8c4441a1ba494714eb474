Lecturers have issued new demands ahead of Monday’s meeting with universities’ management in Nairobi aimed at ending their one-month strike. The new demands include signing of a return-to-work formula to protect all the lecturers from victimisation. The Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) wants the Inter-Public Universities’ Councils Consultative Forum (IPUCCF), which is chaired by Prof Paul Kanyari, to table documents regarding the implementation of the 2013-2017 collective bargaining agreement (CBA). VERDICT They also want a report on the completion of the individual universities’ 2013-2017 CBAs and the 2017-2021 CBA negotiation calendar. Another demand is a calendar for payment of pension arrears from previous CBAs. They also want a return-to-work formula to be drafted in case the deliberations bear fruit. Uasu secretary-general Constantine Wasonga said the union’s national executive committee will meet on Wednesday and give its verdict on the outcome of Monday’s discussions. “I urge our members to disregard communication from the IPUCCF and remain on strike. In particular, do not teach students,” said Dr Wasonga in a statement. UASU He criticised the forum for running paid adverts urging academic staff to resume work, ostensibly because the National Treasury had confirmed the release of funds for full implementation of the 2013-2017 CBA. “Uasu clarifies that IPUCCF and the government have no powers whatsoever to call off the lecturers’ strike. The responsibility of calling off or suspending a strike is vested on the secretary-general, exercised in accordance with the constitution of the union,” said Dr Wasonga. He went on: “The forum and the government understand clearly that the strike may not be called off until Uasu is fully satisfied and has fully verified that the objectives for which the strike was called have been fulfilled.”

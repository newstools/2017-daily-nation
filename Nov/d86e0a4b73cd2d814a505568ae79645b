One thing is certain at the end of every Kenyan Premier League season - that the bottom two clubs are relegated to the National Super League (NSL). Any team struggling to reach the 30-point mark that supposedly ensures safety faces a tense final few games that inevitably end in tears for some supporters. This year, those teams are Western Stima, Thika United, Mathare United and Zoo Kericho. The four are knee-deep in relegation zone and are candidates to join Muhoroni Youth in the NSL next season. The fate of Thika United and Zoo Kericho will be determined on Wednesday when their rescheduled match will be played in Kericho, but Stima and Mathare United provided a big twist in the relegation dogfight last weekend with surprising wins. Mathare braved the muddy pitch at Ruaraka grounds in Nairobi to beat Muhoroni 2-1, while Stima conjured an unexpected 1-0 win over Posta Rangers in Kisumu courtesy of Ezekiel Otuoma’s second half shot. Their performance pushed the battle for survival to the final day of the season, a day when miracles in the relegation battle do happen. Stima coach coach Richard Makumi, a Ugandan whose first stint in the Kenyan Premier League is threatening to end in shambles, has said his team will aim to win the match, and leave the rest to fate. “My job is simple. To win the final game and leave it to fate. Last weekend we got our best results which gave us a slim chance of survival. That leaves us with no other task but to win the last match, which we are determined to do,” he said. Stima are second from bottom in the league and should they lose on Saturday to Chemelil Sugar, they will surely follow Muhoroni to the lower-tier league.

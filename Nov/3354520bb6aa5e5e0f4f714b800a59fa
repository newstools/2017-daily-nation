Anxiety has gripped Nyanza region ahead of Monday’s Supreme Court verdict on the October 26 fresh Presidential election.Police said they are on alert for any insecurity that could arise after the court ruling. LAW AND ORDERNyanza regional police boss Leonard Katana said they expect members of the public to maintain order.“The people must understand that KCSE examinations are still ongoing and [they] must uphold law and order. We do not expect any acts that can disrupt the existing peace,” he said.The police boss, however, refused to disclose their level of preparedness in terms of security saying “that is our own business and we cannot disclose it.”Political temperatures have been high in the region before and after the October 26 repeat presidential election that was boycotted by Nasa leader Raila Odinga. VIOLENCEThe fresh poll was not conducted in the region’s 27 constituencies, following a spate of violence as people said they would not take part after Mr Odinga withdrew from the race.The constituencies are in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay and Migori counties.On Sunday, there was uneasy calm in most towns in the area as people remained apprehensive over the verdict to be delivered by the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice David Maraga.They said it could be a make or break for the country. RULINGKisumu City Residents Voice Chairman Audi Ogada said they expect a nullification of the results “as the region never took part in the election.”“We know the Supreme Court will give a ruling that respects the rule of law and constitutionalism and therefore we have no cause to worry,” he said.ODM Director of Political Affairs Opiyo Wandayi earlier told the Nation that: “In my view there was no election. Remember we were even expunged from the proceedings because we did not take part in it and we were happy of that.” NASAThe Ugunja MP said that as far as they are concerned, Nasa would give Kenyans a way forward.ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohammed said “the so called election was a sham and we do not wish to discuss it.”He pointed out that Kenya was yearning for fresh credible elections with a reformed IEBC to foster peaceful coexistence. 
  
Residents say the election was a "sham" and they expect the court to annul the election.

Migori, Kakamega and Kisumu County assemblies on Tuesday approved a motion by Nasa on the creation of people's assemblies. The three have now joined Busia, Homa Bay, Vihiga and Siaya. The move will enable the regions establish forums through which various grievances will be addressed. MARGINALISED In Kisumu, the motion was tabled by the Majority Leader Ken Onyango who said they have to steer the reforms themselves, following years of marginalisation. The House suspended other businesses to allow members deliberate on the motion. The session was attended by Governor Anyang' Nyong'o, Senator Fred Outa, MPs Onyango Koyoo (Muhoroni), Olago Aluoch (Kisumu West), Dr James Nyikal (Seme), Aduma Owuor (Nyakach), Kisumu Central's Fred Ouda and other county staff. REFORMS Governor Nyong’o said the people’s assembly will provide an opportunity to restore respect for the rule of law. "These assemblies will give residents an opportunity to contribute to matters of national importance," Prof Nyong’o said. Mr Aluoch added: "The powers of the county assembly to debate the motion is anchored on the Constitution."

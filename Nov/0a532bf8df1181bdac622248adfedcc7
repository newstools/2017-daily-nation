Round one leader Simon Ngige dropped to seventh place going into Sunday’s final round of the 2017 Tanzania Open at the Kiligolf Resort in Usa River, after two poor rounds on Friday. Meanwhile, Royal Nairobi's David Wakhu and Mumias Golf Club’s Dismas Indiza charged to second and third places behind Zimbabwe’s Ryan Cairns, who made his third 73 for three over par 219 to lead Wakhu by a shot as the real chase for money begun after the second round cut.  Wakhu fired level par 72 having posted one over in the second round in addition to his opening 75. The long-hitting Indiza, who had started by levelling the course, dropped to a 79 in the second round though he made an eight-shot recovery by firing one under par 71 for 222 and is in a striking position in Sunday’s final round of the Sh800,000 purse tournament where a total of 11 Kenyans made cut.  NGIGE'S POOR ROUND On the other hand, Thika’s Ngige shot a poor 82 in the second round followed by Saturday’s 79 to throw away a great chance of a back to back victory within a month having won the Diani Beach Masters a couple of weeks ago.  Jimmy Molel on 230 was the best Tanzanian at the close of the day. He shot three over par 75. By the time of publishing, the amateurs were still on the course battling it out.  Meanwhile, This year’s Nyanza Open golf championship which was postponed last month, is finally on next weekend at the Nyanza Golf Club course.

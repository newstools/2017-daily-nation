Close to 500 runners will compete in the Kajiado County Half Marathon and 10km races dubbed “Races for Peace and Cohesion” on Saturday in Kajiado County. The 21Km race will start in Kajiado town before athletes head to Umma University along the Kajiado-Isinya road and back, while the 10 km race will go upto Naisula Primary School and back, according to the organisers. Dubbed “Races for Peace and Cohesion”, the races are sponsored by Kajiado County Government and soft drinks giant Coca-Cola. The race organiser Jackson Matanta said the 21 km race will be open to all Kenyans while the 10 km race will be strictly for Kajiado residents. “We have crafted a formula where the top ten runners in each race will win cash awards. It is just a way to enable as many runners as possible to take something home,” said Matanta. Matanta, who is also the Chief Officer for Sports in the County, said the theme was in line with the much needed peace and cohesion after a grueling electioneering period. “Kajiado is a cosmopolitan county and the political divisions experienced need to be healed as soon as possible. It is a welcome event away from local politics,” said Mr Matanta.  Philip Somoire, an athlete, said the cash prizes will make the race attract more youth.

Allies of Nasa leader Raila Odinga are jostling for his attention in the race to be picked for the East African Legislative Assembly (Eala) slots. Those close to Mr Odinga eyeing the seats include his advisor in political affairs Silas Jakakimba and Ms Rosemary Kariuki who is ODM director of membership and recruitment. Nasa CEO Norman Magaya is also eyeing a slot. ODM is expected to get three slots as Wiper gets one. FOUR SLOTS However, ODM chairman John Mbadi told Nation that the party is expecting four slots according to its representation in the house. The Nasa coalition, however, has picked Dr Oginga, who is Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s elder brother and Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka’s son Kennedy. On Sunday, Mr Jakakimba told the Nation that he hopes to be picked for the additional slot remaining to represent the coalition in the regional assembly. “Following my loyalty to Mr Odinga and my experience in international law. I am best suited to represent our coalition in the regional house,” he said. REPRESENTATION By close of business on Thursday last week, the deadline for submission of Eala application forms, more than 240 applicants had returned their papers. Jubilee Party applicants who handed their nomination forms include former MPs Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi Woman Rep), Alice Ng’ang’a (Thika Town), Moses ole Sakuda (Kajiado West), Wanjiku Muhia (Nyandarua), Florence Kajuju (Meru), Hellen Sambili (Mogotio) and Zipporah Kering. For Jubilee’s five slots, three men and two women will be nominated. Regional and ethnic representation as well as gender balance will largely play out in the appointment of Kenya’s new representatives at Eala. The deadline for the submission of the list is on Tuesday in Parliament and Kenya is expected to do the same to the Eala by December 13.

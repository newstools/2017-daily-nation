Three people died Monday evening after a lorry rammed into a shopping complex in Keroka, Kisii County. The vehicle was ferrying sugar from Transmara, Narok, to Nakuru when it lost breaks at a slope at Ichuni. One of the victims, a female student, died on the spot while the others at Keroka Sub-District Hospital. "One man was walking home but the young woman was standing near a shop and was sipping soda in the company of her boyfriend when the truck left the tarmac and hit them," Victoria Bikoro, a witness, said. Keroka Traffic base commander Istabuli Ochale said the driver of the truck was treated for minor injuries at Keroka Hospital and discharged. "The recovery vehicle that we [were] waiting [for] has finally arrived and helped us lift the truck. So far there are no people trapped as we feared at first," he told the Nation.

With the country fixated on the bitter controversy over elections and the brutal police quelling of protests that has resulted in a number of deaths and injuries, one would be forgiven for imagining that nothing else is going on. However, there have been some proud moments in sports and other arenas. There is plenty to cheer about the achievements of talented Kenyans who continue to carry the national flag aloft. Another major achievement that has been overshadowed by the obsession with the struggle to gain or hold onto power is a milestone we should be celebrating. WORLD BANK Whereas economic activity has been severely hampered by the long electioneering period, which was extended from the August 8 General Election to the October 26 presidential poll rerun, there is some good news on the business front. Kenya is up an impressive 12 places in the World Bank’s Doing Business Index 2018. It is now at position 80 among the 190 economies surveyed. As the depressing news of the seemingly unending political conflict rages on, it’s not all gloom and doom. This is the highest ranking the country has attained since 2008, when it was placed at No. 84. The rating is a good indication that the country is ripe for business and can attract foreign investment. The political class must clean up its act so the pursuit of economic prosperity can be enhanced.

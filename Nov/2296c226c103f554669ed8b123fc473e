Carl Tundo is the new leader of the East African Safari Classic Rally. He took over Saturday from Sweden’s Stiq Blomqvist who led in the opening two days. Blomqvist, the defending champion dropped down the order after his car suffered mechanical problems.  The Swede’s Porsche was seen driving backwards for over seven kilometres in the last stage of the day due to transmission issues. He now lies eighth overall out of the 27 cars still in the race. Tundo in a Top Fry-sponsored Triumph TR7 is seeking his first Classic Rally victory. Baldev Chager, the former Safari Rally champion, who is also seeking his first title in this world famous classic rally, is now lying second in his Kabras-sponsored Porsche. Chager is 21 seconds behind Tundo. He was quickest through Stage Seven of yesterday’s competition. Twice winner of the rally, Ian Duncan is glued at the bottom of the table though he scored commendable quick stage times yesterday in his renovated Ford Capri. HEAVY PRICE Duncan’s absence from the Day Two of the competition has cost him dearly in terms of penalty for missing a day out. Raaji Bharij, the Nakuru Classic Rally Champion, is lying in position five in his Intra Africa Insurance Company-sponsored Porsche. Shell-sponsored Jonathan Somen, co-driven by Richard Hechle is holding on to sixth in a Ford Escort while the similar car of Ramesh Vishram/Riyaz Ismail (Ford Escort Mark2) is in the 14th place. “Very long day especially from last night, servicing and finishing at 10pm. Going to sleep at 12am, waking up at 3am. Then starting the day with a long drive all the way to Ol-Donyo Longido.  The sections were great, fast, smooth, hairpins and super sections I must say,” said Vishram. Day Four on Sunday will see the cars tackle Taita Hill Lodge (153km), Shelebwe (78km) and Mackinon Road (63km) before head to Diani Beach Hotel for an overnight stay. Monday is rest day.  Meanwhile the rallying fraternity is struggling to come to terms with the sad demise on Friday of Jaideep Singh Vohra, a director of the event. Vohra died on following road accident as he drove to catch up with the action  The family released details of his funeral that will take place on Sunday morning after prayers at the Pangani Sikh Temple.

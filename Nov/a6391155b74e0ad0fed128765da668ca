A warning by the IMF that Kenyaâ€™s rising public debt poses a grave threat to the economy could not have come at a better time. The National Treasury is just preparing to pursue a syndicated loan and float a second Eurobond. And the IMF has raised the red flag that the public debt, which now stands at Sh4.4 trillion, nearly double the annual budget, must be contained to avoid exposing the economy to dreadful shocks. For the umpteenth time, economic experts, including international donors, have faulted the government for the runaway debt, but it seems nobody is listening. In fact, such criticism has been dismissed as propaganda against the Jubilee administration. Yet, the debt portfolio is reaching the tipping point at 59 per cent of the GDP this year, from a target of 51.8 per cent. This will certainly slow down economic growth. Huge debt crowds out cash for national development because its repayment is prioritised in the tax collections. In effect, it leads to a vicious cycle where the government has to continually borrow to meet its expenditure. The IMF warning should serve as a wake-up call to the Treasury to relook its budgetary priorities with a sharper eye on the long-term economic consequences. It will be catastrophic to expose the country to an impossible debt burden that will continue hanging over our heads for generations.

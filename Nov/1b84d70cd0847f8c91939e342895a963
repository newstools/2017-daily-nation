JOHANNESBURG President Robert Mugabe and envoys from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have held talks in Harare Thursday after the military took control of Zimbabwe, a South African official said. “They are meeting with President Robert Mugabe at State House now,” South African foreign affairs spokesman Clayson Monyela told AFP, declining to give further details. Meanwhile, the head of the African Union said Thursday that the body “will never accept the military coup d’état” in Zimbabwe. “We demand respect for the Constitution, a return to the constitutional order and we will never accept the military coup d’état,” President Alpha Conde said in an interview with French journalists in Paris.  “We know there are internal problems. They need to be resolved politically by the Zanu-PF party and not with an intervention by the army,” added Conde, who is also Guinea’s president. 
  
He is nicknamed Ngwena (The Crocodile) because of his fearsome power and ruthlessness.

The stage is set for the annual Great Ethiopian Run 10km race Sunday in Addis Ababa. According to the organizers, the race has attracted more than 40,000 participants but more attention will be on the elite athletes. The race will see athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia battle for top prize of Sh382,000. Winner of men’s race in last year’s competition, Tsegaye Assefa, will be seeking to retain his title on the streets of Addis Ababa. KENYAN ATHLETES Kenyan athletes Sheila Jepkemoi and Ezekiel Kemboi, both from Iten, are optimistic of performing well in the race. Jepkemoi, who was third in Czech Republic 15km Road Race in August last year, told Nation Sport that she has done enough training and she will be looking forward to a podium finish. “It’s my first time to compete here and having done good training back at home, I hope to make the top three if the weather conditions allow,” said the athlete. Jepkemoi also ran in Iten Marathon where she was in the seventh position after clocking 2:47:00 in March. Kemboi, who will be participating his second international race at the competition, said that he will be seeking to perform well in the race. Olympic 5,000m champion Vivian Cheruiyot, who has also been invited as a guest in the race, said Kenyans can learn from the way the race has been organised.

In it’s draft constitution, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) has proposed the adoption of centers of excellence to develop youth football. This is among the proposals that will be discussed in FKF’s Annual General Meeting on November 18. The proposed centres will admit players selected from FKF Youth leagues to pursue both formal education and football through scholarships, with the federation upgrading existing facilities at the centres and providing equipment. The proposed centers will be recognised as clubs affiliated to FKF and will be eligible to receive transfer fees, training compensation and solidarity contribution. But chairman of Kenya Football Coaches Association Bob Oyugi has urged the federation to not only concentrate on bringing in new stakeholders but to also build its own centre of excellence. “It’s a good idea partnering with various schools to develop players. But FKF should be transparent and also come up with own academy based in Nairobi,” he said. “Schools have their own curriculum and syllabus to follow. The pupils and students could be on holiday or doing exams and this will affect the federation. For example, Harambee Starlets lost 5-0 to Ghana because most players are sitting their final exams. With good planning, it’s achievable,” he said. The federation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Juja Preparatory school as their first centre last month. Oyugi also challenged local authorities to reach out to secondary school football giants like Kakamega High and Upper Hill. “I was one of the pioneers of the National Youth Talent Academy and we had around 25 scholarships in schools that admitted talented players from across the country. Surely we should not only focus on private institutions.”   It is feared the proposal is meant to benefit top FKF officials who run youth academies by way of solidarity fees.

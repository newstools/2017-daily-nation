Seventeen pyrethrum growing counties are working on forming an economic bloc in an effort to revive the collapsed industry. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui said discussions had already started between the 17 governors in pyrethrum growing areas. The 17 are also exploring other key interest areas to help build a stronger regional economic bloc. “I have spoken with Governor Francis Kimemia and the others and we have a roadmap on how to revive the crop that was like coffee for this region. We will also be coming together to boost the potato industry because Nyandarua is fertile,” Mr Kinyanjui said at Sabugo village of Ol Kalou, Nyandarua County. POVERTY He termed it regrettable that poverty levels were still high in agriculturally-rich areas in the region. “We are coming together to form an economic bloc but, more importantly, to lift our people out of poverty. We, the second crop of governors, do not want to make the mistakes made by our predecessors; we are going to work as a team complementing each other,” said the governor. The county government of Nyandarua has already embarked on a pyrethrum revival programme. The county has identified an investor — the Export Processing Zones Authority — as a key partner in pyrethrum farming revival. Governor Kimemia said 800 acres of land in Ol Joro Orok Constituency would be allocated to the investor for pyrethrum farming and processing projects. The Pyrethrum Growers Association has asked governors to include their farmers in their County Integrated Development Plans. The association’s national chairman, Mr Justus Monda, challenged pyrethrum growing counties to draw up strategies that will take the crop back to its former glory.

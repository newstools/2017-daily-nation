November has ushered in loveable doses of fun and frolic to entertain Kenyan theatre goers who adore comedies. Fun merchants from Mumbai India are in town making us laugh to our hearts content. If you are the one who loves Gujarati comedies and have not been to Oshwal Centre Auditorium to watch WAHU HIFI SASU WIFI, you can still catch up with the fun package this evening. WAHU HIFI SASU WIFI (Daughter in law is HiFI as the mother in law is WIFI) is a comedy about a joint family where an elderly mother in law lives with her two sons and their wives. She as the head of the family manages the household with limited income rather smartly. The daughters in law rebel as they cannot have their own way for their needs with the restricted budget dished out to them by the mother in law. Lalitha the matriarch happily surrenders the domestic management with a challenge that might break up the family. Despite objections from the menfolk the daughters in law accept the challenge. What follows is a ridiculous but fun and laughter riot. The lead role of the mother in law is played by Pratima T who is accepted at home in India and abroad as the Comedy Queen and is also lovingly known as Lady Amitabh of the Gujarati stage and screen. There is more fun at the Oshwal Junior High Theatre stage on Sunday evening the 12th November 2017. Hindi Samiti of East Africa  presents FUNTAKSHRI- an open to all fun game, based on the popular Indian party and outings song  A participant commences the game singing the first verse of any song and the next one picks up the last word of the verse to sing another song beginning with that word.

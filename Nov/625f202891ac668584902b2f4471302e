The National Assembly is expected to resume it's sittings on Wednesday morning after a three week recess. According to House Clerk Michael Sialai, among the business to be considered by the MPs include a private member motion on pavement of roads for use by pedestrians and consideration of the County Allocation of Revenue (Amendment) Bill from the Senate. The CARA bill, which provides for horizontal sharing of county revenue, was passed early this month and it requires the concurrence of the National Assembly before it is sent to the president for assent. HOUSE COMMITTEES  The members are also required consider the appointment of members to the committees on Appointment and Selection. The Appointment committee is chaired by the speaker and responsible for vetting of Cabinet Secretaries as and when they are appointed. On the other hand, the committee on selection is chaired by leader of majority and is responsible for the constitution of the other House committees. Since the first session of the 12th Parliament was inaugurated in September, no committees have been formed making it difficult for the House to perform its functions. Among the business awaiting committees include consideration of bills, petitions and also questions from members.   Most of the parliamentary work is done through committees.

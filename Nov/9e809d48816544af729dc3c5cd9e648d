The repeat presidential election did not require fresh nominations, President Uhuru Kenyatta has told the Supreme Court.  While being represented by lawyers led by Fred Ngatia, the court heard that the only situation which would force the need for a fresh nominations would be during the General Election and when the office of the president becomes vacant.  COURT RULING  In his argument, he absolved the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) from blame that it flouted the law by proceeding with the October 26 poll.  "The IEBC was entitled to strictly comply with the Supreme Court ruling for public good," said Mr Ngatia.  He argued that the 60-day period and and the Supreme Court decision would not have allowed for room to hold fresh nominations. He further termed Raila Odinga's withdrawal from the presidential race as 'abandonment'. Court also heard that no candidates who participated in the repeat polls raised any concerns against Cyrus Jirongo's candidature.  He therefore termed arguments on the matter as sideshows.  "As a constitutional mandate, I urge you to ensure governance in this country, you cannot invalidate the presidential election results," said Mr Ngatia.  He added: "Its a humble prayer and the political class has fallen to what is permissible and what is not, a government shall only be formed in accordance with the constitution."

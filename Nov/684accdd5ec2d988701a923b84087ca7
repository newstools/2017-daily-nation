Hi Brenda, I am John and I have a girlfriend that I love dearly. Currently, I’m in school in Western Kenya while she’s at Kenyatta University. She rarely calls or texts unless I take initiative. Sometimes she goes silent for even two weeks. This is heartbreaking for me as it makes me feel like she has another man in her life.  What shall I do? Edu Ji Massive  Dear Jester John, This lady is clowning you, quite literally. Are you in a relationship or do you just love her? If you just love her and you haven't made your intentions known, that's a whole different story. If you are in a relationship...let's just say, you are not in a relationship. There is no such thing as two people who claim to love each other and enjoy each other’s company having some sort of one-sided communication strategy. That complete lack of reciprocity means you are only in a relationship with yourself, and yes, she has found another guy. Either ask her about it or, what I recommend, go silent for a month and see if she calls you. If she doesn't, well, then I rest my case. If she does, depending on how long she takes to notice your absence, I would suggest you end it anyway because this lady is clearly just not that into you. Do you have a problem for Brenda?

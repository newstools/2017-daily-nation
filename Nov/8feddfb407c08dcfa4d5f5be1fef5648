Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and his main rival in August elections Wavinya Ndeti have renewed their rivalry following the rejection of three county executive nominees. Ms Ndeti has been accused in court papers of conspiring to present forged documents during the vetting of the nominees, resulting in the rejection of three of them by the Machakos county assembly. The county assembly rejected the nominees forwarded by Governor Mutua for vetting, saying they are not qualified and experienced to head the departments which they had been nominated. Nominees whose papers were allegedly forged are Faith Wathome, Kimeu Kimeu and Ruth Mutua. According to court documents, Ms Ndeti is alleged to have instructed an employee of Makueni County, Meshak Musyoki, to engage a lawyer to prepare a falsified affidavit against the county executive nominees. The case was mentioned on November 14 in Machakos High Court and will be heard on November 28.

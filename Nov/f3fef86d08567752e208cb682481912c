The 64th World Ploughing Championship will be held at Egerton Universityâ€™s Ngongongeri Farm from November 27 to December 2. Participants from over 20 countries would take part in the event that is being held in Kenya for the second time after an interval of 22 years. In 1995, the Kenya round attracted entries from 40 nations. Among those to feature in the championships are 22-year-old Jay Lennox, the reigning Canadian conventional ploughing champion and 41-year-old Tom Evans, the reversible ploughing champion.  Both are aiming at winning the world title.  The event is mainly organised by the Kenya Ploughing Organisation, which was established in 1996 under the Agricultural Society of Kenya umbrella to run national ploughing contests and help raise the standards of seed bed preparation.  KPO holds countrywide competitions to select participants in the national championship.

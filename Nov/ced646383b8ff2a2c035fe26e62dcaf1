The civilian police watchdog says it has opened investigations into the fatal shooting of a minor in Pipeline estate, Nairobi, on Tuesday. The Independent Policing Oversight Authority on Wednesday said it was also looking into the shooting and wounding of an expectant woman as police clashed with supporters of Raila Odinga in Nairobi’s Eastlands. In a statement, the lobby group said it had dispatched its rapid response unit to investigate the incidents with a view of establishing circumstances of the shootings for appropriate action to be taken. “Upon conclusion, the authority will make recommendations and forward the investigation file to the office of director of public prosecution Keriako Tobiko for his attention,” said the statement by Dennis Oketch who is the head of Communications and Outreach Department. Mr Oketch disclosed that investigations for other elections-related cases are at an advanced stage and the watchdog will make known the findings on conclusion of the investigations. The seven-year-old boy, Geoffrey Mutinda, was playing on the balcony of their first floor apartment in Pipeline, off Outer Ring Road, in an area that had experienced protests earlier in the day. Residents said he was shot by men they said were Administration Police officers from a nearby post. They were riding a motorcycle and were not in uniform but were known to locals, residents said. The Kenya Police Service is on the spot over accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killing of opposition supporters in Nairobi and western Kenya during the election period. Two other children, Samantha Pendo and Stephanie Moraa, were killed in a similar fashion at the height of police clashes with supporters of the National Super Alliance. It is estimated that more than 60 people have died at the hands of trigger-happy police, the majority after being shot.   Mutinda was shot and killed in Pipeline Estate.

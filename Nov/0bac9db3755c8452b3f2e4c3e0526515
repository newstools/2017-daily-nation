Hi Brenda,I have been in a relationship with my guy for five years now. Things have not been rosy over the last one year and he now wants to leave but he has no guts to tell me it’s over because he fears breaking my heart. I have a strong feeling that he is moving on with a friend he recently met. What should I do? Dear Single Sally, Congratulations on your five years. Relationships aren't easy. But the fact that you have gotten this far and tried to persevere for even that one year means that you thought this was something worth holding on to. But now that that's done – it's time to move on, like your ex is clearly already doing. Please don't be the chick who is in denial about the end. You've known the guy for a while, so I'm sure you are very able to tell when he is not with you emotionally or physically any more. The heartbreak will be a lot less if you prompt the split instead of waiting for this gutless guy to show up somewhere with a new girl and have you look like the fool. Welcome to the single life. Do you have a problem for Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com

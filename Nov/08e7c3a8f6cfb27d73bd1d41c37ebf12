The two were allegedly drunk when the incident occurred. By Friday afternoon, the search mission that also involved relatives was extended to the banks of Nyakomisaro River. "We had been searching since morning but were unable to locate him. We are hoping for the best," said John Kimbo, a relative who had joined in the search.

Mr Tinega cautioned residents against crossing swollen rivers especially on rickety bridges. He also asked those residing in areas prone to mudslides move to safer places.

Ambassador Robert Godec will lead the US government delegation to President Kenyatta's inauguration ceremony, the State Department has said. Other US officials are expected to be present for Tuesday's ceremony as well, but President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will apparently not be among them. In a brief email response to a Nation query about the make-up of the US delegation, a State Department official wrote, “Ambassador Godec will be the highest-ranking US government representative at the inauguration, but will not be the only USG [US government] representative present.‎” The official did not reveal the names or titles of the other US officials. The absence of senior figures in the Trump administration could be read as a signal of US reluctance to fully endorse the disputed outcomes of the two rounds of presidential voting. More than 20 heads of state or government have reportedly either confirmed their attendance or have said they are sending a representative to Mr Kenyatta's swearing-in ceremony for a second term.   Memorial to be attended by Nasa leaders led by Raila Odinga.

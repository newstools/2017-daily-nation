Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has called for the recognition of a KCSE supervisor identified as Philip Kalweo and a police officer who braved ranging floods in Meru to deliver KCSE examination papers on foot. On his Twitter account, Dr Matiang’i said he had written to the Chief of Staff asking that the exam supervisor and police officer James Chege be considered for a recognition award. The picture of Mr Kalweo and Mr Chege crossing a flooded section on the Muriri-Isiolo road clutching onto their shoes and examination materials on Tuesday have been circulating on social media. FLOODS On that day, KCSE exams were delayed in some schools due to heavy rains that led to floods, cutting off roads in parts of Meru County. Dr Matiang'i said the two went above the call of duty to ensure safe delivery of examination papers. He added that they demonstrated the commitment of public servants "and through this selfless act they have set an example of "service above self" that we should all emulate.” He said the officials had made their colleagues in the education and security sectors proud.

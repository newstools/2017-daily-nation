Hundreds of people marched Sunday in Hollywood, joining a growing movement against sexual harassment and abuse that emerged after movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and later a string of film personalities faced accusations of misconduct. Demonstrators gathered at the iconic Dolby Theatre in Hollywood — which hosts the Academy Awards ceremonies — to draw attention to their cause. Protesters carried placards that read "The way I dress is not a yes!!! #MeToo," and "Unite to fight patriarchy." The protest comes on the heels of a surge in women and men who have gone public with the gory details of systemic sex abuse by those in positions of power in the film industry and beyond. The #MeToo campaign to denounce harassment and abuse debuted on Twitter in mid-October, with women across the world revealing their own experiences of sexual harassment. "I'm really happy to come here, because really it's Hollywood that opened this floodgate," Tarana Burke, who co-founded an organization called Just Be Inc., told The Los Angeles Times. "It's really symbolic to have this march happen, not with Hollywood stars, but in Hollywood." Last week, comedian Louis C.K. became the latest Hollywood figure to be felled by sex abuse allegations, following producer Weinstein, producer-director Brett Ratner, writer-director James Toback, actor Kevin Spacey and music mogul and TV producer Benny Medina.

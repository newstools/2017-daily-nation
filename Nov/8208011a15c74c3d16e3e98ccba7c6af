A magistrate has ordered the arrest of Kisumu Senator Fred Outa and former Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga for failing to appear in court. The two leaders are facing several charges stemming from disruption of a training organised by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in Kisumu Central. CHARGES Some of the charges they are facing are entering in an electoral centre without authority, obstructing an election officer from executing lawful duties and malicious damage to property. Mr Outa and Ms Odinga were accused of entering Prosperity Building where the IEBC was training presiding officers in preparation for the October 26 elections without permission. Youths disrupted a planned session and vandalised tents and plastic chairs at the town’s Huduma Centre. The accused were set to appear in court this morning for mentioning but failed to show up. “A warrant of arrest has been issued against the two because they have gone against the orders of the court,” said Chief Magistrate Julius Ng’arng’ar. SH500,000 On October 23, the two were arraigned before the court for allegedly attacking IEBC officials. They were released on Sh500,000 personal bond each but without surety. Mr Ng’arng’ar ordered them to present themselves before the county criminal investigations office on October 24 to kick-start investigations into the matter. Before appearing in court, Mr Outa and Ms Odinga  had been in hiding after they heard police were looking for them. They later surrendered themselves to the court after Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko ordered their arrest.   Tobiko orders their immediate arrest and prosecution over attacks on IEBC staff in Kisumu.

Political leaders in Kisumu have yielded to calls from residents and business leaders to have future protests pushing for electoral justice end by noon to avoid disruption of businesses. Speaking at the Gala Awards of the Lake International Pan-African Film Festival that was held at Anga Mega Theatre in Kisumu town on Saturday, Kisumu Senator Fred Outa revealed that protests will no longer last the entire day. Since the National Super Alliance (Nasa) launched anti-electoral commission protests in August, business in the lakeside city has been affected as police always engage the protesters in running battles the whole day. BUSINESS LEADERS This has seen some residents and various leaders appeal for a plan for the protests that will not scuttle other activities. The Kisumu Business Owners Association chairman, Mr Israel Agina, and Kisumu County and Small Enterprise Association chairman Antony Kwache are among business leaders who have called for the change. But while he emphasised on the region’s commitment to fighting for democracy in the country and, in particular, an end to electoral impunity, the former Nyando MP said there was a need to carry out the protests strategically to save the county from lagging behind economically. He said that the change will also go a long way in doing away with criminals who disguise themselves as protesters to cause mayhem. “I want to promise Kisumu residents that we still have our agitation to a better democracy but we want to do it moderately,” said Mr Outa. “We will be doing our demonstrations in the morning and end by lunchtime.”

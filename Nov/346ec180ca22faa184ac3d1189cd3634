The Nandi county government will continue with the process of seeking compensation for atrocities committed by the British government against the Nandi community during the colonial era. Governor Stephen Sang on Wednesday said the county will seek redress for families displaced from their ancestral lands and the brutal killing of legendary community leader Koitalel arap Samoei over 120 years ago for resisting colonial rule. “Historical land injustices have not been properly addressed owing to lack of concerted efforts and lack of political will by past leaders in the region,” said Mr Sang. “My administration will, however, pursue justice through the courts as well as other mechanisms provided for by the National Land Commission,” said Governor Sang in Kapsabet. He disclosed the plans when he met a delegation of elders from Tartar location in Chepkunyuk ward, Nandi Hills sub-county, affected by systemic land injustices in the region. A similar process had been initiated by former Governor Cleophas Lagat who appointed international lawyer Karim Khan and Lilan and Koech Advocates to collect evidence to present at the International Criminal Court in a case against displacement of the community and the killing of Koitalel arap Samoei. This was after the county assembly approved Sh108 million to hire legal experts to file the suit at the ICC and the African Court of Justice. Koitalel arap Samoei was shot dead in October 1905 by Col Richard Meinertzhagen at Ketbarak near Nandi Hills after leading a seven-year rebellion against British colonialists. This led to the displacement of the Nandi community from their ancestral lands, paving the way for multinational tea companies. Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has been at the forefront in demanding that tea estates give bursaries to needy children as a way of giving back to the community.

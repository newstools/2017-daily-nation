Siaya High Court Judge Esther Maina has vowed not to bend the law and give an unfair ruling in the election petition challenging the election of Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. Justice Maina warned anyone who might attempt to bribe her to rule in their favour in the case of dire consequences. The judge is presiding over a petition case filed by former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo challenging the election of Governor Rasanga. Justice Maina, who spoke moments before adjourning normal hearing, vowed to give a just ruling in the ongoing case. "I have information that either the petitioner or the respondent have connived with their advocates to influence the outcome of this case. I will not fall into their traps," said Justice Maina. TAKE MONEY BACK The judge further asked Mr Gumbo and Governor Rasanga, who were in the court, never to send anyone to coerce her in making her ruling. She asked them to take back their money if they have sent anyone to execute the mission. “I will not receive money from either you or your lawyers,” said Justice Maina. The soft-spoken judge advised lead counsel Ogutu Mboya (for Mr Gumbo) and Francis Wasuna (for Governor Rasanga) to advise their clients promptly on the consequences of attempting to bribe a judge. The judge then adjourned the sitting until Monday next week.

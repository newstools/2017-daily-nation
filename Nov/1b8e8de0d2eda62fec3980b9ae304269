IN LUANDA, ANGOLA Kenya Ports Authority whipped Equity Bank 64-46 in an all-Kenyan match played here in Luanda Saturday to stay on course to finish fifth in Fiba Africa Champions Cup for women.  The dockers, who finished seventh at last year’s championship in Maputo and are seeking to post a better performance at this year’s competition,  dominated their opponents and could have won by a bigger margin had they remained focused in the last quarter.  KPA, coached by Anthony Ojukwu, led 21-17 in the first quarter and 40-24 at the break in a match that saw Beryl Diana Akoth stand out with 17 rebounds and seven points to her credit.  KPA outscored Equity 19-14 in the third quarter for 59 -37 scoreline and led 15-09 in the fourth quarter to put the game beyond the reach of the bankers, who also lost by 16 points to KPA in Uganda during Zone Five championships.  Equity’s Hilda Indasi scored a game-high 18 points, KPA’s Belinda Okoth registered nine points and Equity’s Mercy Wanyama eight. Betty Kananu top-scored for KPA with 15 points, Natalie Akinyi had 11 points while Seline Okumu managed 10 points in the match.  KPA will Sunday play either GSP of Algeria or DC Motema Pembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the race for positions five and six, while Equity Bank will play the loser of the match between the two teams in battle for the seventh and eighth places in the championship.

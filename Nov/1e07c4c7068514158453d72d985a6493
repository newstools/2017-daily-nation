Hi Brenda, I'm 25 years old and in love with this girl, 23, who is in another relationship but she keeps telling me how much she loves me more than her man. We also talk about marrying and our future together but I feel guilty about falling in love with someone's girlfriend. What should I do? Please help!   Dear Gullible Gideon, The woman you supposedly love is taking you for a ride. Falling in love with another man's woman is not the problem here – the problem is the woman herself. If you love someone, be with them. Who is she with now? Not you. I'm sire she is giving you all kinds of reasons as to why she can't leave him. Those aren't reasons. They are excuses. And why do you think, when you get together, if you ever get together which is looking highly unlikely at the moment – what makes you think she won't fall for someone else while you serve as a placeholder? Wake up!  Got a question for Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com 
  
Clearly you're a guy who likes words of affirmation, while her chosen method might be gifts, or spending quality time with you.

Three men suspected to be behind the Sh50 million heist at Kenya Commercial Bank in Thika will be arraigned today. Police arrested the suspects at Joyland Estate in Juja on Saturday, where they also found Sh17.1 million in one of the houses. WOMAN The suspects identified as Charles Mwangi Murakaru,30, Halford Munene Murakaru,32 and Julius Wainaina, 32, were detained at the Juja Police Station. Police are set to present them in a Thika court. Detectives privy to the investigations into the heist said the flat was rented by a woman just a week before the arrests. The woman, police said, moved into the flat a day before the break-in at the bank. Inside the house, police found money in seven different currencies kept in gunny bags. The cash was kept at different places of theÂ  house. TUNNEL The money included 17,135,000 Kenyan shillings, 1,311 US dollars, 340 Great British pounds, 5 Canadian dollars, 85 Australia dollars, 46,000 Tanzania shillings, 40 South Africa rand and 20,000 Ugandan shillings. Investigations into the heist was carried out by detectives from several formations of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, including the Banking Fraud Investigations Unit, The Flying Squad and the Special Crimes Prevention Unit. Also recovered at the Juja house were burglary tools, several mobile phones and National Identity Cards. The recovered cash was transferred to KCB headquarters in Nairobi. Robbers last weekend dug a tunnel from one of the stalls that shares a wall with the bank before gaining access into the strong room before making away with the cash.   The police are holding three people for questioning.

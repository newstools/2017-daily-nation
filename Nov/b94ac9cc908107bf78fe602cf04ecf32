The taxman is set to auction dozens of vehicles at its Mombasa warehouse over what traders attributed to slow business following extended electioneering. In a move likely to cost buyers and dealers millions of shillings, Kenya Revenue Authority said it will sell the vehicles and thousands of tonnes of cereals that have not been cleared, some imported by Ugandans. In a Kenya Gazette notice last Friday, the Customs and Border Control department gave importers of the 163 motor vehicles one month to clear the goods ahead of a public auction on January 17 next year. “Notice is given that unless the mentioned goods under the custody of the Customs Warehouse Keeper, Kilindini are entered and removed within the next thirty (30) days, they will be sold by public auction,” read the notice. The vehicles are mainly owned by importing companies based in Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret and Mombasa.

Kenya Auto Bazaar Association secretary-general Charles Munyori said 2017 has been a difficult year, especially for used car buyers and most firms are surviving on savings with few sales reported. “We usually import vehicles using money received from clients but as of now no client is placing any orders with us,” he said.

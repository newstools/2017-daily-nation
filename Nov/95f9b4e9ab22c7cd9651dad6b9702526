Kenya international boxer Nick Abaka and Fredrick Ramogi from Kenya Defence Forces won their respective bouts to sail through to the final of the fifth Leg SportPesaa National Boxing League at Uwanja wa Mbuzi ground in Mombasa on Friday. Abaka utilised his wide experience too sail through to the finals when he outpointed Peter Buti of Prisons with a 3-0 victory in a light-heavyweight bout while Ramogi won the super-heavyweight fight, beating Prisons’ George Awiti. KDF’s arch-rivals Kenya Police had four of their boxers sailing to the finals. Kenya Police started the day on a fine note when their fighter Boniface Mogunde won his welterweight bout after referee stopped contest in round two to save Prison’s Jacob Kimanthi from further punishment. Other Police boxers who qualified for the finals to be held on Saturday were Tobias Okeyo - who beat James Osore of Kenyatta National Hospital 3-0 in the light-heavyweight fight as Elly Ajowi registered a 3-0 victory against KDF’s Fredrick Onyango.  Former Coast Combined boxer, Shaffi Bakari now with Police team had an easy afternoon when his opponent KDF’s Simon Mulinge could not fight in their flyweight bout due to injury. In a middleweight bout, Eric Otengo of Prisons beat Sande Sinzole of Cost Combined. A large crowd of Coast fans cheered their boxer who put up a good account of himself but lack of experience saw him clobbered 2-1. On Thursday, new boxing sensation Isack Meja was among the six Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) boxers who booked their semi-final slots. Meja was the first KDF pugilist to book his place in the semis when he registered a 3-0 victory against Kisumu’s Kevin Akoko during the bantamweight contest. 
  
Meja looked the better boxer from round one where he managed to floor Akoko.

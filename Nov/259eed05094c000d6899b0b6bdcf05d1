There was little celebration at Shikokhwe Primary School in Kakamega County after it emerged that all the 24 candidates who sat the 2017 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exam had scored below 300 marks. The school was in the news after pupils were photographed sitting the exam in derelict semi-permanent classrooms in Kakamega North sub-county. Results from the school indicate the top candidate from the institution scored 288 marks followed by a candidate who got 275 marks. The poor state of the classrooms sparked a debate among leaders on social media as they accused each other of failing to intervene and improve learning facilities at the rural school in Malava constituency. On Thursday, the school’s headteacher John Karungani said the school was still attempting to access the full results by sending a text message to the code 22252. He said the candidates whose results the Nation had managed to access were from the school. “We have been experiencing network problems while trying to download the results but I have asked my deputy to keep trying and coordinate the exercise,” said Mr Karungani.

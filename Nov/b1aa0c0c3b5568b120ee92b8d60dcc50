Tension has gripped Kasiluni, Inyanzae and Ngomeni areas in Kyuso Sub-County on the Kitui-Tana River border after the disarmament of police reservists following the killing of two herders two weeks ago. Many residents are spending their nights in the bush for fear of retaliatory attacks by herders. Four homeguards have been arrested and 13 guns confiscated. Two of the reservists were arraigned on Monday for being in possession of excess ammunition and sentenced to seven years in jail. Insecurity in the region has left more than 30 people dead since last year. Mwingi North MP Paul Nzengu recently accused security organs of taking sides in the conflict, saying no herder had been arrested. “I condemn killing of innocent Kenyans but security should be handled in a fair manner,” he said. James Kimanzi, a resident of Inyanzae, said he had witnessed the killing of many farmers since the 1960s. Kyuso DCIO Tom Achiya said the 13 guns were withdrawn for investigation.

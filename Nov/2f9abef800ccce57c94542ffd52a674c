Police have arrested a 36-year-old man for being in possession of an 8-foot python skin in Mpeketoni, Lamu West. Peter Kahoro was arrested early on Sunday by police officers on patrol at Majembeni Village while he was trying to transport the python skin out of Lamu. MEDICINE Confirming the incident, Lamu County Police Commander Muchangi Kioi said the man was being held at the Mpeketoni Police Station for interrogation after which he would be arraigned in court to face charges of poaching. In a separate incident, police on Lamu Island launched investigations after four cartons of medicine were found floating on the sea shores of Shella. The drugs, weighing 20kg, were discovered by fishermen. Mr Kioi said the drugs were still in good condition. “We suspect someone had stolen the drugs from a hospital and hidden them. We are investigating the matter,” he said.

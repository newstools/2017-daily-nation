National Super Alliance (Nasa) supporters could be headed for a clash with the police after Inspector General Police Joseph Boinnet said they would be blocked from accessing the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, where they plan to receive leader Raila Odinga on Friday. Mr Odinga, who has been on a trip to the US and Europe, returns to what Nasa says would be a “grand reception” complete with an airport party, and preceded by a rally at Kamukunji grounds on Thursday. PROTECTED AREA But Mr Boinnet warned that the supporters would not be allowed at the airport unless they comply with the Public Order Act (2016). “Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is a protected area, hence access is open to travellers and all others with legitimate business at the airport who must be subjected at all times to the standard security procedures,” Mr Boinnet said in a statement sent by NPS spokesman George Kinoti. Mr Boinnet said it would not be advisable to mobilise huge crowds at the facility as it risks jeopardising the safety of air operators, passengers and other airport users. “Those without valid reasons to enter the facility will be denied entry. Therefore, those making plans for that day are advised accordingly,” Mr Boinnet added. REHEARSAL Mr Odinga has been in the United States since Tuesday last week for meetings with top bureaucrats and Congress officials, as well as Kenyans living there, pushing for support for his electoral reforms agenda. His supporters said they would hold a “dress rehearsal” rally on Thursday before Mr Odinga’s arrival on Friday. Self-declared National Resistance Movement General Miguna Miguna took to social media to ask Nasa supporters to turn up in large numbers to welcome Mr Odinga.

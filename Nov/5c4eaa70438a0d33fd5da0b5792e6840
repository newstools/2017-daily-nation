Sharp-shooting Dismas Indiza rolled in a total of eight birdies in the second round of this year’s Rwanda Open, to extend his lead to nine shots at the par 71 Kigali Golf Club course on Thursday. Indiza, sponsored by former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero, picked up birdies on the first, fifth, sixth and seventh, dropping one at the eighth for a low 32 at the front nine. He made four back-to-back birdies from the 14th to 17th with a bogey at the 11th spoiling a clean back nine. His score of six under 65 for a two rounds total of 132 gave him a smooth lead from Rwanda’s Ernest Ndayisenga who posted 76 for a total of 141 and a shot better than Kenyan Justus Madoya who levelled the course for the second time for 142.  Uganda’s Herman Mutawe finished the second round in fourth place on 143 after a level par 71. Kenya’s Sullivan Muthugia also fired his second 72 in the tournament for 144.

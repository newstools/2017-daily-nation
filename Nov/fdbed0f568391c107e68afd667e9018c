Three people were injured on Sunday along Thika Road when one of the vehicles in Starehe MP Charles Kanyi Njagua’s, alias Jaguar, motorcade was involved in an accident. According to Juja OCPD Patricia Nasio, the accident occurred near Kenyatta Road in Juja, Kiambu County. TWO ACCIDENTS The Juja police boss said that the MP’s vehicle was travelling to Nairobi and had had three occupants – the driver and two police officers attached to him – who sustained injuries. They were rushed to Ruiru Sub-County Hospital. She said a vehicle had earlier veered off the road and some vehicles slowed down at the scene of the accident, when cars coming from behind rammed into them. “There was an accident that had just happened in the area, which made curious motorists to stop to have a glance at a vehicle,” said Ms Nasio. The car in the MP’s motorcade was the fourth in line to ram into a vehicle in front of it. It rammed into a canter that had slowed down at the accident scene. In March, Mr Njagua’s Range Rover Sport hit two men – Joseph Maingi and Mugo Abdalla – who were riding on a motorcycle, killing them on the spot along the Makutano-Sagana highway.

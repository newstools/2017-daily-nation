Egerton University has introduced a new academic course in its bid to promote cohesion in Kenya. Titled national cohesion and integration, it will be offered to all first year students beginning January 2018. Egerton hence becomes the first public university out of the 31 to officially announce the launch. The course is in line with the national performance contract that the university signed with the ministries of Education and Interior. VALUES Dr Dorothy Nyakwaka, the varsity's National Cohesion and National Values committee coordinator, said: "This will be a common core course for all first year students. "The course will help new students understand and appreciate the national values and coexist peacefully with their colleagues during their stay at the university," Dr Nyakwaka said. Some of the values the students will be taught include equality, integrity, devotion to duty, transparency and accountability. ADMISSIONSThe Nakuru-based university has three campuses in Nakuru Town, Baringo and Nairobi with a population of more than 20,000. At least 3,621 first year government-sponsored students were admitted through the Kenya Universities and Colleges Placement Services this year. Dr Nyakwaka said the institute has been training staff at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences ahead of the unveiling. "We have enough staff in the department of Philosophy, History and Religion who will be handling the course and everything is now systems go ahead of the launch."

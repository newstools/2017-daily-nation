Inside a white tent erected on the shores of Lake Nakuru on Friday were families of three people who perished in a helicopter crash two weeks ago. Only two bodies out of five have been retrieved from the lake. Next to the tent was a group of people singing gospel music to encourage the families. Ms Florence Nyambura, the mother of John Mapozi, who died in the crash, said her life had changed for the worse since she learnt of her son’s death. RECOVERED Ms Nyambura has been at the lake since the crash happened hoping her son’s body would be recovered. “I live in Molo but I now have to stay in Nakuru so that I can be here daily,” she said. She was content with the efforts of the divers searching for the bodies and continued to hope that they would retrieve that of her son and the two others. “My heart is not at peace until I see my son’s body. I hope they will find them sooner,” she said. The families have been receiving counselling from members of the Kenya Counselling and Psychological Association (KCPA) since the plane crash occurred. CLOSURE KCPA Nakuru branch chairman Mr Stanley Ruguita, said the families have a communal session twice a day. And there are several others where they meet with counsellors individually upon request during the day. “The general feeling of the families is to have the bodies of their loved ones recovered so that they can do for them a decent burial and bring closure on the matter,” said Mr Ruguita in an interview on Friday. He noted there was a remarkable improvement in the mental state of the families as some of them could now openly talk about the people they had lost and were slowly coming to terms with it. “When we started most of the families only cried, but now talk about their feelings,” said Mr Ruguita. The five who perished were identified as Anthony Kipyegon, Sammy Gitau, John Mapozi, Apollo Maloa (pilot) and Veronicah Muthoni.

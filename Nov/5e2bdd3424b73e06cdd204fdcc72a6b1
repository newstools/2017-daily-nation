Bandits have shot and injured eight passengers in Kamanga, Samburu County. Isiolo police commander Charles Ontita said they are being treated at Isiolo Referral Hospital. "The bandits from Samburu County are said to have had intelligence of a planned raid by raiders from Isiolo County who had already surveyed their area, which they intended to attack on Wednesday before boarding the same bus," he said. Mr Ontita said the bus was heading to Isiolo Town from Merti, adding that police from Samburu East Sub-County have launched investigations.

The rains currently being experienced in many parts of the country have, once again, exposed the countryâ€™s lack of preparedness. Though largely considered a blessing, the rains have also claimed lives and caused destruction and inconvenience across the country. On Saturday, for example, travellers using the Mombasa highway were stranded for hours after sections of the road were cut off by floods. A similar situation was experienced in Turkana recently. This, it must be mentioned, is not the first time the authorities have seemingly been caught off guard despite the weather forecast indicating there would be rain and possible floods. The Kenya Meteorological Department says the rains will subside as the month progresses and eventually ease out in December. BRIDGES For the government, an immediate response is needed to repair damaged key infrastructure, including roads and bridges. There is also a need to ensure emergency response is activated to save lives and property, and avoid inconveniences to road users. But, more importantly, a long term strategy to deal with storm water needs to be instituted. For a country that is categorised as water deficient, there should be an elaborate system of harvesting and storing the rain water. Other basic measures like ensuring proper drainage should also be taken. This should include unclogging the drainage systems and reclaiming grabbed riparian lands that interfere with the flow of storm water. Individually, it is also important to take personal responsibility and care as the rains continue.

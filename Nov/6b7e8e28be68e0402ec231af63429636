Retail chain Tuskys has taken over shop space vacated by troubled Nakumatt Holdings in Kisii and Kisumu, growing its branch network to 64 stores. Tuskys has revamped the combined space of 40,000 square feet at a cost of Sh240 million and says that the new outlets will provide a range of benefits to the Nyanza region, including employment and supply opportunities. Tuskys Echiro, located on Kisii’s Moi Avenue, is the retailer’s second branch in the area since it already operates Chigware branch. Tuskys Lolwe Supermarket at Mega Plaza in Kisumu is also an addition to the United branch located at United Mall. The retailer is also set to unveil the upgraded Thigiri branch in Spring Valley targeting premium market later in the month.

Tuskys is set to acquire a stake in Nakumatt in what is meant to give a lifeline to the retail chain which has recently closed several outlets after being hit by cash flow hiccups. Tuskys has offered to inject Sh650 million into the troubled retail chain and recurring payment guarantees of between Sh1.5 billion and Sh3 billion for the outstanding debt. The offer is subject to approval by the Competition Authority of Kenya.

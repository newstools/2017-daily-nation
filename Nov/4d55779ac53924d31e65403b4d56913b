IN LUANDA, ANGOLA American import Wilson Dominique and Akashili Nkechi combined for 50 points as First Bank from Nigeria locked out Kenya Ports Authority at the quarter-finals stage of the Fiba Africa Champions Cup for women in Luanda, Angola Friday.  The Nigerian club comfortably won 84-63. The dockers, who played an improved game, gave as much as they received leading the Nigerians at the opening stages of the game with Betty Kananu, Seline Okumu and Natalie Akinyi playing a pivotal role.  With a minute to the end of the first quarter,  KPA were leading 19 -17 after the Nigerians reduced a 17-11 gap midway in the quarter.  A three-point shot by Dominique helped the Nigerians take the first lead of the game 20-19 at the break.  The rains then descended on the Kenyans in the second quarter when Akashili and Dominique who contributed 20 points each in this game punished KPA’s school girl mistakes to race to a 44-28 lead at the break. KPA were down 66-42 at the end of the third quarter but put up a spirited fight in the last quarter where they outscored the experienced Nigerians 21-18. Other scorers for First Bank were Celia Okoye, who had 10 points, while Akaraiwe Uwa managed nine as KPA had Okumu scoring 11 and Felmas Koranga 10.  “We gave it our all but they used their vast experience at this stage to outwit us. We live to fight another day,” said KPA coach Anthony Ojukwu after the match. His First Bank counterpart Favour Ahmedu was full of praise for his charges saying they had improved with every game.  KPA will Saturday play the winner of the match between Equity Bank and Primero De Agosto in the seventh-eighth place play-off

Footprints on Sunday qualified for the Kenya Basketball Federation women’s Division One League final. Footprints under coach Juma Kent, a Fiba international referee, knocked out rivals Africa Nazarene  University 3-0 in their semi-final play-offs after winning Game Three 53-38 at Strathmore University, Madaraka. The match was delayed for three hours because of the late arrival of referees which disrupted the flow of the day’s five fixtures. Footprints were just too good for ANU to handle with superstar Daisy Ayodi, captain Purity Wachira and Emily Achieng pulling the strings on the court. Footprints led 11-3 in first quarter and extended that lead to 29-17 at the breather. The writing was on that wall at this stage for Nazaren who needed to win this game a force a fourth in their best-of-five match-up. Footprints had won Game Two 61-45 on Saturday and Game One 46-35 one week ago. Enroute to the semi-finals, Footprints swept away Day Star University 2-0 in their best-of-three series quarter-finals. ANU had eliminated JKUAT 2-0 in another quarter-finals. Footprint coach Juma Kent said: “We lacked the bench in Game Two but we were a full house in Game Three and won without struggle.” In the men’s Premier League quarter-finals play-offs, Umoja rallied from behind to lock the series 1-1 after beating Co-op Bank 59-48 in a tough Game Two. Co-op Bank had won Game One of the best-of-three series  57-41 and needed a second consecutive win to advance on a 2-0 run. Emyba put up a brilliant fight to lock the men’s Division Two semi-final play-offs 1-1 with an overtime 66-62 win against Blazers in Game Two. Emyba had lost 62-60 in the opener but forced overtime after the teams tied 58-58 in regulation time.  On Saturday, the top Premier League quarter-final play-offs Game Three between Blades and rivals USIU-A Tigers was stopped in the fourth quarter because of darkness.

Acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i on Saturday denounced the violence in Nairobi that led to the death of five people and destruction of property.  Speaking at Nyabururu Girls National School in Kisii County, Dr Matiang’i said the Friday chaos during the arrival of Nasa leader Raila Odinga should not recur.  "The ugly scenes we saw yesterday are very concerning to us. "No differences of opinion are good enough for us to have acrimony and spoil our country," he said. PRAYERSAt Ogango SDA Church in Kitutu Masaba where he presided over a funds drive, he urged the locals to prayer for the country. "The clergy should pray for our elected leaders to respect one another irrespective of their political affiliations," he said. The prayers were led by Nyamira Conference President Thomas Nyakundi and the area pastor Nico Asuma. He went on: "God does not allow leaders to abuse one another. There is a bad political wind that is flowing in the country, which requires God's intervention." PEACEDr Matiang'i asked politicians to respect each other for the sake of peace and tranquillity. Pastor Nyakundi said no Kenyans should not die because of politics. "Kenyans should respect their leaders as they are God-given. God has directed us in Proverbs 29: 2 to respect elected leaders and it through that we can be blessed and have peace in the country," he said. EDUCATIONMr Matiang'i declined to give journalists an interview over the Friday mayhem, saying it was his worship day. At Nyabururu Girls, he delivered a grant of Sh50 million for the school's expansion. He was accompanied by Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose, Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi and Nyamira Woman Rep Jerusha Momanyi.

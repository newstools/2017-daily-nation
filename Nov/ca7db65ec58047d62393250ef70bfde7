Various towns in Nakuru and Nyandarua counties were on Tuesday deserted as many residents remained in their homes to watch the inauguration of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto on television. Most business premises in Nakuru Town, for instance, were closed. Residents chose to follow the proceedings from their homes and designated places in the town where large TV screens were placed. DEVELOPMENTIn Naivasha town, hundreds of residents chose to catch a glimpse of the swearing-in of the two leaders at entertainment joints, where there were giant screens. Those who chose to stay indoors included former Lake View ward rep Simon Wanyoike Wanango.  “I was among those in the campaign trail, which was not only energy-sapping but also took a toll on all Kenyans. Today, I chose to remain indoors and watch the inauguration on TV,” he said. He said it was time to build the country and urged politicians to shun politicking. ECONOMYAnother Naivasha resident, Ms Warwathia Kanyi, opted to close her business and follow the ceremony on TV.  “The prolonged election period has really affected our businesses and it’s time to build the economy for the benefit of Kenyans,” she said. In Kinangop, Engineer and other towns in Nyandarua County, most of the residents had travelled to the Kasarani Stadium in Nairobi to witness the inauguration. After the event, many locals in Nakuru marched along Kenyatta Avenue in jubilation as they waved twigs, Jubilee banners and blew vuvuzelas.

Barely two days after a gangster sped off from a robbery scene in a white car, police tracked him down and arrested him. Using mobile telephone technology, police arrested Mr Hudson Musamali Isalamba, 37, at 7.45am on Thursday. “Upon interrogation he led police officers to a dumpsite off General Mathenge Road where he had hidden a mini Ceska loaded with 15 rounds of 9mm wrapped with a plastic bag. He was escorted to parklands police station,” police said in a preliminary report. The pistol with a serial Number B181951 was snatched from its owner on Ring Road in Nairobi’s Parklands at 6 pm on Tuesday. Following the robbery, the gangster jumped into a white car, a Toyota Mark X bearing registration number KBW 266A, and sped off. Police circulated the car’s details to all police stations in Kenya, with orders to intercept it. The victim was carrying out a regular inspection of National Police Service street cameras on Ring Road when a man snatched his bag containing the pistol, an iPad and Sh100,000. Videos captured by the street cameras are relayed and monitored at the NPS headquarters at Jogoo House. The victim also reported that he had parked his car – a Mercedes Benz - at the nearby Oval House, prior to the robbery.

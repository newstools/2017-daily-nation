The raging strike in the tea industry does not augur well for the country. This is precisely because tea is a major foreign exchange earner. Besides bringing in the revenue the country so badly needs to meet its commitments, it is also a source of employment, thus contributing directly to the improvement of the people’s welfare. Nearly two weeks ago, some 60,000 tea pickers downed tools to push for the implementation of a court order that granted them a 30 per cent salary increment. The Labour Court stopped the companies from sacking or evicting the employers from their staff quarters after their union issued a strike notice. Incidentally, Central Organisation of Trade Union’s secretary-general Francis Atwoli is directly involved in this issue, being also the boss of the Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union. And Mr Atwoli has told the workers that theirs is a legal strike and they should not give in to intimidation, urging them to wait for guidance from union officials. Strikes are costly to employers, as they disrupt operations and hamper production. But even as they push for their rights, workers also know only too well that without production or provision of services, their salaries cannot be guaranteed. It is important, therefore, that both the union and the employers shun threats and intimidation and engage in negotiations to break the stalemate.

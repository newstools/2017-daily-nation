David Nzambuli, the best student in Kajiado County in the 2017 KCPE exams says he surpassed his expectations. “I had set my sights on 430 marks but I surprised [my dream] by getting 445 marks,” says the boy who sat his exams at Kenvic School in Ngong. Nzambuli, who hopes to become an engineer, told Nation that he worked smart and listened to his teachers. “Most importantly, I believed in God,” he said. Kenvic School had over 40 candidates scoring 400 marks and above. The school had a mean score of 390 with 98 pupils having sat the KCPE exams. The last student had 320 marks. MOTIVATED Anthony Munene, the school’s headteacher, said that teachers at the school always feel motivated hence the good results. “Our teachers feel a sense of ownership in the school. Besides, we have a very low turnover of teachers. The teachers we worked with in Standard Eight have been with us for over ten years,” explained Mr Mwangi. “That sense of continuity is important for pupils to perform well.” He added that parents also play a role in the overall performance of the school. “The parents have a scheme for motivating teachers. That and the fact that they pay fees in time means that our teachers are paid on time. This makes them feel appreciated,” he said.

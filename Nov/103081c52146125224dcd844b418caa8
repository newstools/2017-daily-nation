The Central Organisation Traders Union (Cotu) has accused tea companies in Kericho of using police to forcefully evict workers participating in the on-going strike from the residential houses. Speaking at Tom Mboya Labour College in Kisumu on Friday, Secretary-General Francis Atwoli said that he had received information that many of the workers had sustained injuries after being clobbered by police officers who were working under the instructions of the managements of tea companies. He said that he had talked to the Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and forwarded some photos showing the brutality that some of the workers sustained. He demanded action against the police officers involved. “This morning I received very sad information. Some of our members have been beaten and are in hospitals in Kericho and I want this menace to stop. “I have talked to the inspector-general of police and forwarded some of the brutality photos to him for action to be taken against those officers,” said Mr Atwoli   Tea workers through their union will Wednesday argue why they should not be sacked for striking.

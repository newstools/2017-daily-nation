More than 535 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination candidates at Olympic Primary School in Nairobi have finally received their correct exam results. The correct mathematics results came two days after the exam results were released on Tuesday, ending anxiety that had hit the school since all the candidates had received marks that they said were not theirs. In the results, all the candidates got between 29 and 51 per cent in the mathematics paper. CORRECT MARKS School headteacher Fredrick Odhiambo confirmed all candidates now had the correct marks. “In the previous results, the best candidate had 384 marks but, after the correction, our top candidate has 427 marks and we have 13 candidates with more than 400 marks,” Mr Odhiambo told the Nation. He said candidates are now happy after receiving the correct results. Kenya National Examinations Council acting chief executive Mercy Karogo acknowledged the problem, saying the issue had now been resolved. “It was a misprint but has been corrected and candidates should not worry,” said Ms Karogo. Speaking on Tuesday during the release of the examination results at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum of Development, Knec chairman Prof George Magoha said the acquisition of 20 new scanning machines that cost Sh100 million enabled the marking of the examination to be completed in two weeks. “The new machines are faster, more efficient and accurate when it comes to processing the examinations. The council was able to realise accuracy of up to 99.99 per cent in processing the papers,” said Prof Magoha. He said that for composition, sign language and braille, the council engaged 5,316 teachers who completed the work within five days.

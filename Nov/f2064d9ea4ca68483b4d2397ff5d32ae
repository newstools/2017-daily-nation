Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo has called for a probe into a deal in which a private company has been collecting revenue on behalf of the county government. The senator said ward reps should probe the company, which collects revenue in US dollars and sterling pounds and then remits it to the county in shillings. She accused the firm of pocketing the difference when the currency fluctuates. The firm was contracted to collect the revenue by the defunct county council. Ms Dullo said the controller of budget has raised concern over the low revenue collected. Senator Dullo further asked MCAs to review the firmâ€™s contract as soon as possible in order to boost county revenue collection for the benefit of residents. Isiolo Speaker Hussein Roba lauded Senator Dullo for pointing out the issue, saying the county assembly will look into the matter. Mr Roba said the mentioned firm has been in an unclear working relationship with the previous administration. Mr Hassan Balla, a former councillor, said the devolved government has lost a substantial amount of funds owing to the deal which he termed as irregular.

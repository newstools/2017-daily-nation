The seventh edition of the Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic will be held on November 25 at the Animal Health and Industry Training Institute (Ahiti) in Nyahururu, Nyandarua County. The event  whose theme will be “Strengthening farmers’ capacity for higher yields” will feature a host of agricultural specialists and other stakeholders like agri-input dealers and transporters. Like in the previous editions, the event will include training, knowledge-sharing, exchanging of ideas for better agribusiness practices, exhibition and demonstrations on the best farming practices and technologies to enable farmers enhance efficiency and farm productivity. Farmers and all those planning to venture into farming and agribusiness are encouraged to attend the event. The function would also give farmers opportunity to directly engage with experts and network with other key stakeholders. There would be no gate charges but, as in the previous events, one would need a copy of the Saturday Nation to enter the venue. Nelson Maina, the marketing and communications manager at Elgon Kenya, a longtime sponsor of the event, said farmers should expect information on pest control, climate-smart farming and modern and superior agro inputs. There will also be information on agribusiness financing, farm mechanisation, value addition and effective transportation solutions. Ahiti principal, Dr Wangari Ngethe, said she is anxious to host the event, noting the institution has plenty of experts to engage farmers on animal health production and agribusiness in general. “Our institution specialises on offering diploma training in animal health production and this extends beyond domesticated animals,” Dr Ngethe said, urging farmers to turn up in large numbers at the educative event for lessons.   Farming clinics and collaborations with stakeholders is key to enhancing agricultural productivity.

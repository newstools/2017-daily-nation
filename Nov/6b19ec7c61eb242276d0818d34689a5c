Ulinzi Stars came from a goal down to hold the visiting Kariobangi Sharks to a 1-1 draw in an evenly contested SportPesa Premier League match at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru on Wednesday.  Veteran midfielder Ibrahim Kitawi opened the scoring for the William Muluhya-coached Sharks at the half hour mark with a first-time shot that beat goalkeeper Timothy Odhiambo.  But Odhiambo will rue the mistake that led to the goal for a long time as he misjudged the shot before the ball dropped into the net behind his back.  The soldiers levelled matters six minutes later after Samuel Onyango headed home Omar Mbongi's delivery from a corner – which marked the Kenyan international’s sixth league goal of the current campaign. Sharks, who lost 2-0 to AFC Leopards in the GOtv Shield final on October 20, should have regained their lead in the 43rd minute but Masoud Juma missed the target in a one-on-one against goalkeeper Odhiambo. Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso introduced Churchill Muloma and Justine Onuong’a for Oliver Rutto and Daniel Waweru a move that hardly changed the soldiers’ lethargic display. On the opposite side, Muluya introduced Mathew Odongo, Cavin Odongo and Francis Manoa for Kitawi, Duke Abuya and Ovella Ochieng'.

A man has been admitted at the Homa Bay Referral Hospital in critical condition after he was attacked by a crocodile in Kabuoch, Ndhiwa Sub-County. Mr George Onyango, 30, was attacked in River Kuja on Wednesday evening as he was heading to his home in Bungu Village. TOSSED Eyewitnesses said the crocodile attacked him when he was trying to cross the river. "The reptile captured and threw him on the other side of the river bank where he suffered injuries on both legs," a witness said. Mr Onyango raised the alarm and villagers attacked the crocodile with stones and other crude weapons until it went back into the water. KWS Mr Onyango's brother Mr Erick Otieno alerted the Kenya Wildlife Service officials about the incident. He urged them to relocate the crocodiles as they have been attacking residents' livestock. He said the number of crocodiles in the river has increased. "Recently, a woman and her child suffered injuries after two crocodiles mauled them in the river when they went to fetch water," said Mr Otieno. BRIDGE He urged the Homa Bay County government to construct a bridge across the river to reduce prevent such attacks. Mr Otieno argued that lack of a bridge has also affected transport in the area. "Traders cannot reach trading centres located across the river, especially during the rainy season, for fear of being attacked by the reptiles," he added. Area Assistant Chief Joash Osuju confirmed the incident. "We took him (Mr Onyango) to the hospital after I received reports that the man had injuries," said Mr Osuju.

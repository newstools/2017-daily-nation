Kenya Regiment Rifle Club’s (KRRC’s) Gurupreet Dhanjal is the new Kenya Open Small Bore champion. Dhanjal needed a point to floor four-time champion Gulraaj Sehmi for his maiden Kenya Open victory in the explosive two-day championship that ended on Sunday at General Service Unit (GSU) Training School’s Embakasi shooting range. Gulraj’s sister, Preeyam Sehmi, won the women’s contest, downing 573 points to beat Mercy Chodo from Ghana on 567 as Sarah Sintoi from GSU carded 566 to claim bronze. In the main event, Dhanjal, 37, downed 592 points on Saturday followed by 589 on Sunday for his total of 1181 to outwit Gulraj, who staged a superb charge in Sunday’s round of 592.  Gulraj, back-to-back winner in 2011 to 2013, was hugely affected by Saturday’s round of 588 in the shoot that was sponsored by I.P.B.S and Pressmaster. Gulraj, who is also the former Africa champion, won the 2015 contest but could not defend his title last year after the event failed to take place. He took Super X Class honours.

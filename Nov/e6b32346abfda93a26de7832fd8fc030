The electoral agency officials have admitted that there were variations in the information on forms used to declare the results of the county’s governorship election. This emerged during the hearing of a petition challenging the election of Governor James Ongwae. Officials Moses Daula (Bobasi returning officer) and Sydney Namulungu (county returning officer), however, said the errors do not warrant invalidation of Mr Ongwae’s election. Mr Daula told High Court judge Hellen Omondi that many of the errors were of a “transpositional nature, resulting from a fatigued poll staff”. VOTERS In Mombasa, former Senator Hassan Omar told an election court that 300 voters in the region were denied their right to cast ballots on August 8. Testifying in a petition in which he is challenging the election of Governor Hassan Joho, Mr Omar, who was being cross-examined by IEBC’s lawyer Bridgitte Ndong, said some of his agents were evicted from polling stations. Mr Omar further told Justice Lydia Achode that where he voted, the Kaderbhoy polling centre, no incident was witnessed. PETITION DISMISSEDIn response to the petition, Mr Joho said the election was properly conducted. At the same time, the High Court in Kitale has struck out a petition challenging the election of Endebess MP Robert Pukose for lack of proper service. In her ruling, judge Cecilia Githua said the petition was “incompetent and incurably defective” for want of service on the applicant, which warranted it to be struck out. The petition was filed by Mr Robert Wamalwa, who claimed that the poll was marked by malpractices.

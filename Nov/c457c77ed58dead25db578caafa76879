The Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has brought back Levy Labeeb from South Africa’s Western Province to help refine Kenya Simbas’ defence ahead of the Hong Kong Cup of Nations to be held from November 10 to 18. Labeeb, who handled the team last year for several matches including the Test match against Hong Kong where Kenya won all the two matches, is expected to arrive in Kenya on Thursday alongside head coach Jerome Paarwater from South Africa. Also expected from South Africa on Friday is Springboks legend Jean De Villers who will be the chief guest at Friday’s Nondescripts RFC annual dinner. The centre, who made 109 appearance for the Springboks, will on Saturday hold development clinics for Nondies before crossing over to the RFUEA grounds for a session with Kenya Simbas. “We thought it wise to have Labeeb back after our defence proved porous this season,” said team manager Wangila Simiyu adding that Labeed will be travel with the team that leaves on Monday for the Hong Kong Cup. Kenya lost to Germany 30-29 in May, drew with Hong Kong 19-19 before losing in their second match 43-34 in August. In the Rugby Africa Cup, Kenya finished second behind Namibia, who retained the trophy. The Simbas drew Uganda 33-33 away before beating Tunisia (100-10), Senegal (45-25) and Zimbabwe (41-22). Their hopes of recapturing the title went up in smoke whey they lost to Namibia 47-5 away. Kenya will launch their Four-Nation Hong Kong campaign against Chile on November 10 with Hong Kong meeting Russia. The Simbas will seek to roar against the Russians in their second duel on November 14 where Hong Kong will take on Chile. Kenya face Hong Kong on November 18 with Russia going against Chile. Wangila disclosed that the final team of 26 players for the Hong Kong tour will be named from the larger squad of 35 players, who have been training at the RFUEA grounds.

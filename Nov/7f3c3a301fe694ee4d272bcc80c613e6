The National Boxing League might have just ended, but the shambolic officiating of most bouts ruined what could have been a great finale. Allegations of match-fixing and biased officiating were rife in the semi-finals as some teams accused the judges of favouring their rivals. Kenya Police retained the title with 103 points, beating Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) by one point. However, many felt that KDF would have won the title were it not for the sloppy judging. We laud Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) president John Kameta for launching investigations into the allegations, and promising action within two weeks. The investigation should not be confined to the final leg, as teams had earlier complained that cartels had fixed bouts for some teams. The association must get to the bottom of these allegations and action must be taken against those found culpable. A few rogue judges and referees must not be allowed to kill up-and-coming talent. Justice must prevail in the boxing ring if our country is to reclaim its past boxing glory. Boxing standards have fallen badly over the past years and one of the reasons is the poor handling of matches where good boxers have suffered or even ended their careers as casualties of compromised judges.

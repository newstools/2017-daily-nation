Nasa leader Raila Odinga has abandoned his ODM candidate for the Kitutu Chache South parliamentary by-election and rallied his supporters to vote for the former MP for the area, Mr Richard Onyonka. The by-election is set for Tuesday. Mr Odinga declared that he will back Mr Onyonka (Ford Kenya), instead of ODM’s Samwel Omwando. Other leaders seeking the seat are Mr Justus Mochoge (Amani National Congress), Mr Andrew Maubi (Wiper) and Mr Antony Kibagendi (Jubilee). SINGLE CANDIDATE Mr Odinga said the four National Super Alliance (Nasa) co-principals, including Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi, agreed to back a single candidate for the position. This implies that Mr Odinga, Mr Musyoka and Mr Mudavadi abandoned their own candidates for Nasa co-principal Moses Wetang’ula’s man. Mr Wetang’ula is the leader of Ford-K. “We came to an agreement that we support one strong candidate and we must also vote as one unit, Nasa, so that we can defeat Jubilee,” said Mr Odinga at Ruga centre. Mr Wetang’ula crisscrossed the constituency, campaigning for Mr Onyonka.

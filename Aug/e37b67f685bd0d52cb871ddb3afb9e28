The National Super Alliance has raised serious integrity issues on the conduct of the General Election, even as they asked their supporters to come out in large numbers to cast their ballots.On the eve of the elections, Nasa bigwigs Raila Odinga and Musalia Mudavadi addressed separate press conferences in which they attacked the integrity of the voters register and claimed that Jubilee Party is planning to switch off Electronic Voter Identification Devices (Evids) in all their strongholds to allow for rigging.Speaking after meeting a delegation of the EU election observers, Mr Odinga questioned the integrity of the voters roll, the revelations by IEBC that 11,000 polling stations are outside mobile telephony networks and the mass mobilisation of security forces in Nasa strongholds noting that all these were part of dirty schemes to rig. Our confidence in the register has dwindled considerably in the last one month after the commission failed to submit to us a certified copy of the register, Mr Odinga said after his meeting with the EU observers.MONKEY BUSINESS We see it as a deliberate attempt to do some monkey business doing the transmission of results, Mr Odinga said of the revelation that some poll centres are outside networks.Anyone can get a certified copy of the voters roll after paying Sh20,000 to the commission. Mr Odinga said Nasa suspicion on the integrity of the register had been aroused after the commission failed to submit a copy even after it paid the amount.Kenya Wildlife Services officers and Kenyan Prison Services officers queue at a polling station in Nairobi, on August 7, 2017, ahead of their deployment to secure polling stations.

The plot will start in one region, spread across the country and see IEBC resort to manual processes. This will then give way to pure manual voting and stuffing of the ballot in the excuse that systems have failed. This information was leaked by the IG himself to his relative, he alleged.He further claimed a military aircraft model Y12, left the Laikipia Airbase, Nanyuki on August 6 on a suspicious mission.The aircraft according to Mr Mudavadi was loaded with six large cartons containing 300 pieces of smoke grenades and was destined for Lamu via Moi Airbase. According to the politician, the aircraft off-loaded half of the cargo in Nairobi and proceeded to Lamu with the other half.MILITARY EXERCISE As much as we would like to believe that the movement of the items is a normal and routine military exercise, the timing of the movement cannot fail to raise our suspicions that the likely intention is for the military personnel to use the items or have handed them over to personnel drawn from other security agencies (police and intelligence) and assigned to perform special duties that we have shared with Kenyans in the recent past, Mr Mudavadi said.Jubilee Party secretary-general Raphael Tuju dismissed the allegations saying the Opposition has been crying wolf for long.Despite the concerns, Nasa urged their supporters to come out in large numbers today and cast their votes. A number of our leaders will be visiting various parts of the country and staying on the ground with them. We are doing everything to ensure our supporters are safe across the country, Mr Mudavadi said.SECURITY OFFICERSMr Odinga asked supporters across the divide not to be intimidated with the heavy deployment of security officers but instead come out in large numbers to cast their votes. For Nasa supporters come out and vote because we are on the brink of history, Mr Odinga said. Ignore the heavy presence of police and vote. Even those Jubilee supporters should know that it s their right to come out and vote. Jubilee Party Secretary General Raphael Tuju dismissed the allegations saying the opposition has been crying wolves for so long. They have been crying wolves for a long time and therefore we will not take them seriously this time, Mr Tuju told Nation on phone. email print email print He also told police to be impartial.

The hardline decision taken by the incoming governors in the hope of ending the ongoing strike by nurses is unlikely to achieve the desired result. The threat of sacking the nurses if they do not end the strike in a week is likely to intimidate them into returning to work but will not resolve the underlying grievances that prompted the strike in the first place. It is regrettable that the strike was allowed to go on for so long. That has put the lives of many poor Kenyans in peril, considering the critical role that nurses play in the healthcare chain. Despite the threats issued on Thursday, however, the leadership of the nursesâ€™ union must also be willing to listen to the counter-arguments made by the Council of Governors as well as the Salaries and Remuneration Commission. POLITICAL WILL They must be willing to give these institutions, as well as the courts, room to reach an agreement that is agreeable to all parties and sustainable in the long term. Since the strike began, the public has hoped that there will be sufficient political will on both sides, not only to end it but also to iron out outstanding disputes and pave the way for a long-lasting solution and detente between the union and devolved governments. That hope remains but both sides must not foul the air in the negotiating room.

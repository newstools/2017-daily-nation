That is what great team work can deliver and kudos to Cheruiyot and Kiprop for the good ground work, said Manangoi, adding that they were under pressure after the Kenyan youngsters delivered during the World Under-18 championships in Nairobi. It s a great feeling to win and this is just the start of my reign, said Manangoi, who has now set his sights on the Commonwealth Games title next year in Australia.Kiprop, who handed Kenya its maiden World 1,500m title in 2011 Daegu, hailed his colleague s performance, saying he is happy that the title remained in Kenya for fourth consecutive time.Kiprop said he intends to shift gears to 5,000m as Cheruiyot was happy with his efforts for silver. It was a tough race and somehow we needed to sacrifice to uphold and honour and dignity, said Cheruiyot, adding that his day will soon come. email print email print The Kenyan clocked 14:34.87 to beat Ayana.

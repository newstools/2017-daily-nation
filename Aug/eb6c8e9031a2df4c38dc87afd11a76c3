The electoral commission has formally published the results of the elections of governors, senators and woman representatives. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati made the formal declaration in the Kenya Gazette published on Friday. THE LAW The publication now sets the stage for the swearing-in of MPs in the National Assembly and the Senate although the list of Members of the National Assembly has to be published first. Once the list of MPs is published, the president can then convene the first sitting of the new Parliament as set out in the Constitution. Article 126 (2) of the Constitution says: “Whenever a new House is elected, the President, by notice in the Gazette, shall appoint the place and date for the first sitting of the new House, which shall be not more than thirty days after the election.” SEPTEMBER 7 This means that Parliament must hold its first sitting by September 7. There had been reports last week that Parliament would hold its first sitting next Tuesday but that can only be determined by the publication of the notice by the president. At their first sittings in their respective Houses, the lawmakers will elect their speakers and deputy speakers. Speakers are elected from among persons who are not MPs while their deputies are elected from amongst the sitting MPs as per the Constitution.

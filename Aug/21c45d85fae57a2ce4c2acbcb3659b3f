The Jubilee team in Nairobi has appealed to the Kamba community in the city to vote for them in the upcoming elections. During a meeting with the Akamba living in Nairobi, gubernatorial aspirant Mike Sonko promised equal living standards across the city. On housing, Mr Sonko promised to do away with shanties and initiate a slum upgrading programme. “With the national government we will construct permanent houses and do away with mabati (iron sheets)houses,” said Mr Sonko. TASSLE Speaking at the same forum, Nairobi woman representative Racheal Shebesh said the lack of rapid development in the city is due to a poor working relation between the national and the county government since both came from different coalitions. “The national government had plans for the city from hospital equipment to slum upgrading projects but we were frustrated by the county government we could not implement most projects,” said Ms Shebesh. Johnson Sakaja seeking for the Senator seat told the community that the government has never discriminated them despite not voting for it in 2013. Sakaja said that since 1963 no Kamba has ever been a mayor at City Hall and Mr Sonko would make history once they elected him.

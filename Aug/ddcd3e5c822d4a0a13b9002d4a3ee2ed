LAS VEGAS Ringside seats were being offered on secondary ticket markets for an eye-watering $100,250 (Sh10 million) apiece as of Thursday, even though some 1,700 seats in the 20,000-capacity venue remained unsold for the fight between boxing legend Floyd Mayweather and mixed martial arts superstar Conor McGregor. Millions of fans across the United States meanwhile are expected to shell out $99.95 (Sh9,995) to watch the fight on pay-per-view television, the most important economic engine of the spectacle. A little over two months after the fight was confirmed in June, Mayweather and McGregor will touch gloves at Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena in a 12-round boxing contest which will be beamed to more than 200 countries and territories. BIGGEST EVENT Fight promoters have breathlessly talked about the bout surpassing the $600 million (Sh60 billion) generated by Mayweather’s 2015 fight with Manny Pacquiao, insisting that interest has been off chart. “This is the biggest event that has ever happened in combat sports,” said Dana White, the chief executive of MMA’s Ultimate Fighting Championship. “This fight will reach over a billion homes worldwide.” The sense of anticipation has endured despite an unrelenting chorus of disparagement across the boxing world.   Mayweather, 40, is one of the most skilled boxers of his generation.

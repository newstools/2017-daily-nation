Leaders in Kisumu County have asked the police to own up for the deaths reported in Kisumu during protests that followed the announcement presidential results. Kisumu County Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o said the police should take responsibility for the killings. He spoke during the memorial service of six-month-old Samantha Pendo at St Joseph Catholic Church Milimani, Kisumu on Friday where he argued it was obvious the public is still outraged by the continual denial by the police. “The county commissioner (Mohammed Maalim) tried to speak to people last week but residents declined to listen to him. He never uttered a word of sympathy for the people of Kisumu yet he wants us to listen to him. We say no,” said Prof Nyong’o. FRACTURED SCALP He was referring to an incident where the audience jeered Mr Maalim when he tried to speak at Prof Nyong’o’s inauguration on Monday. Samantha Pendo died Tuesday August 15 evening at Aga Khan Hospital Kisumu after suffering severe injuries in the head. A post mortem showed that she had a fractured scalp, which led to her death. Baby Pendo died four days after she was hit on the head by people the family says were police forcing their way into people’s homes in Nyalenda slums in Kisumu. The Police, to date, deny the claims. Kisumu Senator Fred Outa said police should have allowed residents to hold peaceful demonstrations in pursuit of justice. Baby Pendo will be laid to rest at Konjira Village, Ugunja in Siaya County on Saturday.

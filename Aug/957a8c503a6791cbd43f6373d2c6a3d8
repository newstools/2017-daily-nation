The US has urged patience as the electoral commission tallies presidential poll results. President Donald Trump's administration on Thursday said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) should be given time to determine the winner of the Tuesday poll. FRAUD “We also encourage the IEBC to continue communicating openly with the Kenyan public," State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement. "We welcome the IEBC’s commitment to fully investigate any allegations of fraud, with the engagement of all election stakeholders.” The statement, the first on Kenya elections, came hours after the opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) rejected provisional results and asked IEBC to declare its candidate Raila Odinga the winner of the poll. The opposition claimed it had obtained a copy of leaked official results from IEBC servers that put Mr Odinga ahead of the incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati has since dismissed Nasa leaders' demand, saying their claim that they have a copy of final results is “grossly incorrect and premature”. PEACE The State Department also asked candidates who may dispute IEBC’s final results to do so within the law and “not through threats or acts of violence.” The Donald Trump administration, at the same time, applauded Kenyans for maintaining peace before, during and after the poll. It also welcomed the statements made by international and domestic missions observing the poll. Most observers— including the EU, Carter Centre Observer Delegation, Union Election Observer Mission, AU, Igad and the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region— have said the General Election was largely free and fair. “(The statements) have contributed to transparency, integrity, and public confidence in the electoral process,”  Nauert said.   Chebukati describes document purported as having come from the commission as “plainly falsified.”

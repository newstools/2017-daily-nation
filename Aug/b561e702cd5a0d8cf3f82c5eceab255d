Kilonzo, whose brother Peter Kilonzo also plays as a winger for the Bankers and the Kenya Simbas, was a victim of robbery in an M-Pesa shop on Monday, July 24 in Kasarani, where he was shot close to the heart and died while receiving treatment at the nearby St Francis Community Hospital. The rugby fraternity raised Sh1.48 million for his funeral on Tuesday while the main fundraising was held on Wednesday.Kilonzo propelled the bankers to Kenya Cup and Enterprise Cup victories last season. He was named man-of-the-tour when KCB toured South Africa for two weeks early this month. Considered a future Kenya Simbas, Kilonzo was a versatile back who preferred playing in midfield.

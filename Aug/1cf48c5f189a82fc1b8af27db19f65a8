At least three people were injured and property worth millions of shillings destroyed on Saturday after fuel tankers burst into flames in Mombasa. Several fuel storage tanks and tankers of Mbaraki Bulk Terminal Ltd, a firm owned by Mombasa tycoon Mohammed Jaffar, were destroyed during the midday incident. A statement from Mbaraki Ltd said an oil tanker caught fire within the premises. The fire spread to two other tankers before being contained by firefighters from Mombasa County, Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). “It was such an abrupt explosion that I could not tell the fate of my colleagues, I escaped unhurt.    A message from the Energy Regulatory Commission said the cause of the fire was yet to be established, but investigations were ongoing. The property is located at the KPA Mbaraki Wharf and handles bulk bitumen, diesel, heavy fuel oil, kerosene and palm oil. A worker, Mr George Odongo, said the fire started with an explosion while they were refilling an oil tanker. He added that there were more than 10 workers when the blast occurred, forcing them to flee to safety.    I don’t know what happened to my colleagues because we all ran in different directions,” said Mr Odongo. However, Mr Mohamed Ahmed, a driver, said the fire started after one of them drove a tanker into the weighbridge. “We told him not to park the tanker near the weighbridge and suddenly we heard a loud explosion after which a cloud of thick smoke engulfed the entire area,” said Mr Ahmed. The fire caused panic, forcing neighbouring business premises Nakumatt Likoni supermarket, Boss Freights Terminal and Gulf Energy to shut down with employees evacuated to safety. Kenya Power disconnected electricity supply while police officers were sent to the area.

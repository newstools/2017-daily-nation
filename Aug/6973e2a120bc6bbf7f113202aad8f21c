Kenyan professional Stefan Andersen eventually found his form to tie for sixth place during the weekend s Vodacom Origins of Golf tournament at the Western Cape s Arabella Country Club in South Africa.He fired two under par 70 in each of the last two rounds for a total of level par 216. It was however a slow start for the South Africa-based Kenyan pro as he bogeyed five holes with only one birdie for an opening round of four over 76 which almost threw him out of the cut.During the second round, Stefan managed five birdies at the front nine and four at the back nine, but dropped several shots for his first 70 of the weekend.During the final round Stefan birdied the second, eighth, 12th and 15th with two bogeys for the second 70, to take home 24,250 Rand(about Sh169,750). I have been playing well, though I have not been able to find the groove. I must say, it was great going back to Arabella, having finished second here last year," said Andersen.Winning the event was South Africa s Keith Horne on six under par 210. The beautiful but challenging par 72 course in Kleinmond Western Cape was designed and built by a top South African course designer Peter Metkovich who also re-designed the Muthaiga Golf course in Kenya in 2003.Andersen's next stop-over will be Sun Wild Coast Sun Challenge in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday followed by the Vodacom Origins of Golf at Zimbali Country Club in north Durban from August 31 to September 2. email print email print

Hi Brenda, I’m in love with this girl whose parents are very rich. She claims to love me too but she is always too busy to meet me when I want her to but when she wants to meet me, she expects me to go running. It seems like she wants to meet me at her convenience and it leaves me feeling used. I don’t want to cheat on her but this is leaving me frustrated. What should I do?  Young man (May I call you that? You’ve not disclosed your age but this seems like a young man’s problems), there seem to be a number of things you are dealing with here. I will mention only two. Apart from the obvious lack of communication about your feelings (nowhere do you indicate that you have communicated this frustration to her), you are also dealing with low self-esteem issues which seem to be stemming from the fact that the girls’ parents are rich. In case you haven’t noticed, life is not a soap opera. Her being rich will never cease to be an issue until you stop using it as a crutch! You need to work on open and clear communication in your relationship and also deal with whatever is causing you to have low self-esteem if you really want this relationship to move forward. First things first: Talk to your girlfriend about your feelings. If she really loves you as you have indicated, you might be surprised at the results.  Got a problem for Brenda?

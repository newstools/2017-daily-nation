In June, Kenyan tea was shipped to 41 export destinations, the same number of countries in the similar period last year. During the month, 23.25 million kilos of Kenyan tea was sold through Mombasa Auction against 28.02 million kilos recorded in June 2016. The average tea auction prices for Kenyan tea for the period under review was higher at Sh323 per kilogramme against Sh248 for the corresponding period last year. The directorate says the improved prices were attributable to good demand against lower supply of tea in the first quarter of the year due to hot and dry weather conditions that cut supplies. Agriculture and Food Authority says production of green leaf will drop from 473 million kilos produced in 2016 to about 420 million kilos this year.

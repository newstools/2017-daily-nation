The re-opening of all public universities, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed by a week. The 31 universities will now resume business on August 28. This is according to the resolution of the universities’ vice-chancellors. “Consequently, academic activities and programmes should be adjusted accordingly by the respective University Senates and constituent university college academic boards,” said the Chairman of Vice-Chancellors Committee Francis Aduol in a public notice. Universities closed early this month to allow students and staff to participate in the August 8 polls. Most of them had scheduled re-opening on August 18. However, the Ministry of Education had pushed it to August 21.

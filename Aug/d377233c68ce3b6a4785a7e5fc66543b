Dr Mutua said the move will allow a thorough, independent audit and suitability assessment of staff and financial operations of the county government. “I have directed all financial officers – procurement, accountants, auditors, directors etc to proceed on immediate leave from today until further notice. They are not to access government premises until they are recalled,” said Dr Mutua at a press conference outside his office.RADICAL SURGERY He said the objective was to ensure that residents got value for their money. “There is need to improve efficiency, remove cartels and enhance accountability and integrity in all levels of my government,” he said. Dr Mutua added that this was part of a comprehensive radical surgery he intended to undertake and which was informed by his interactions with residents during his campaigns. “I will be announcing more changes in the next few days and I promise my people of Machakos and the various stakeholders that I will ensure that you receive government services in a transparent and efficient manner,” he said. The 437 staff affected are from both the county treasury headquarters as well as those seconded in other government departments in the county.

Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar has said he is positive of winning the governorship position, despite several hitches. Senator Omar, the Wiper party candidate, said he is prepared to take over the top office, criticising the incumbent, Hassan Joho, of failing to drive the agenda of residents. "I am sure that come Tuesday the people of Mombasa will make their right choice. I am glad that Raila Odinga did not publicly endorse Joho at the Nasa rally and left the people to decide," he said on Saturday. ENDORSE He spoke at his office in Renaissance Centre where he announced the conclusion of his campaigns. On Friday, during a press conference at Mr Johoâ€™s office where Mr Odinga signed a memorandum of understanding with trade unions, Mr Odinga endorsed Mr Joho for re-election. CHAOS But the Nasa presidential candidate did not repeat the same at the rally at Mama Ngina gardens, where the legislator was jeered by Mr Joho's supporters. "Even me I have been endorsed by my party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. "Raila told the people of Mombasa to choose their leader and they know who that person is," he said. Hence, he blamed the incumbent for being shouted down.   Hassan and Joho rivalry turns ugly.

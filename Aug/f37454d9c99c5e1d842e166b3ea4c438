The stage is set for Kenya’s fiercest league derby on Saturday, pitting Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards, at the Nyayo Stadium. The two football clubs boast a popular national audience and hence this game will, as always, command a sizeable attendance. Of note, this fixture has traditionally generated passion and tension among the youthful supporters, whose emotions at times degenerate into crowd trouble and chaos. This should not be case this time round. MATCH ABANDONED A league match between these two sides in 2015 was abandoned because of chaos, which resulted in several injuries and damage to property. And in the most tragic incident involving these two teams, seven fans were killed in a stampede at Nyayo Stadium seven years ago when security personnel failed to contain the crowd. With this background, we call for reason and sanity among supporters. A football match can end in either a win, a loss or a draw and fans should learn to accept these results. Never should a match outcome precipitate violence. Importantly, security agencies should be on standby to maintain law and order.

Geoffrey Kimani has been re-appointed Kenya Sevens Strength and Conditioning Coach for a third stint, a statement from Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) said on Friday. Kimani’s two previous spells were from 2008-2011 and 2015-16 alongside previous team coach Benjamin Ayimba. He will now link up with current coach Innocent “Namcos” Simiyu. Kimani returns after one year to take the position left by Englishman Ian Gibbons who quit just after two months. “Back to a new but familiar challenge. It is great to be back home and honoured to serve my country,” Kimani tweeted on Friday. Kenya Shujaa are set to start their preparations for their upcoming 2017/18  season that includes the Safari Sevens, the Sevens World Series, the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia and the Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco, USA. Kimani was in charge of Uganda Sevens in their outing in Hong Kong 7s where they were seeking core status, but did not qualify after they lost in the semi-finals. He is also a Level 4 sprints coach who coached the Kenya team at the 2015 World Championships. Shujaa, who played for the better part of the season without a strength and conditioning coach, finished a disappointing 12th with 63 points. Elsewhere, former South Africa Sevens and Western Province speedster Egon Seconds will be the man in charge of the first test between Kenya Simbas and Hong Kong in Nairobi next Sunday. Kenya will play Hong Kong in the second test set for August 26. Both fixtures will be played at the Rugby Football Union East Africa ground off Ngong’ Road in Nairobi. The two sides last met at the same venue last year, with Simbas winning 34-10. Kenya, who finished second in the Rugby Africa Gold Cup, are using the matches to prepare for next year’s 2019 World Cup qualifiers. Kenya just missed out on qualifying for the 2015 competition.

The woman found dead together with Chris Msando had just completed her three months attachment at the Naivasha Sub-County hospital. Medics who interacted with Carol Ngumbu for the duration of her internship say they were shocked by her death. COOL “She was reserved, cool and amiable…it was hard to pick her out from the rest,” said a medic, who interacted with her at the nutritional department. “She was among students whose performance we assessed in the month of May and her ratings were okay,” added the county hospital employee, who sought anonymity. Another employee described her as “an introvert” who rarely mingled freely with others. “When through with her day duties, she would quietly slip away,” said the medic. The nutritional student had just completed her studies at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) Karen Campus and was due to graduate in December. The Medical Superintendent in charge of the hospital Dr Joseph Mburu confirmed that Ms Ngumbu undertook her internship at the health facility. “She was among the student on attachment commonly referred to as rural experience programme,” he said. Dr Mburu said the student successfully completed the attachment programme. The 21-year-old hailed from Gachie, Kiambu County and her body was found a few metres from where the body of Mr Msando lay at Muguga Forest, Kikuyu Sub-county.   Family identifies her as Carol Ngumbu, a KMTC graduand.

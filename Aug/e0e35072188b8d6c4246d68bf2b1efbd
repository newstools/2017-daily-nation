Drama ensued in Lamu West after the returning officer was prevented from announcing the final results for the parliamentary seat. Despite receiving results from all the wards, Mr Abdalla Chikophe was told by one of the parliamentary candidates to first address complaints raised. WINNER Mr Rishad Hamid Ahmed of ODM party said if their issues are not addressed then results will not be accepted. The results from the electoral agency put Mr Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap party in the lead with 11,090 votes followed by Mr Ahmed (10,950 votes). TALLYINGMr Ahmed claims that not all votes from various polling stations, especially those he considers to be in his strongholds, were tallied and that others had been wrongly calculated to favour his opponent. "I swear to you that the winner canâ€™t be announced at this moment. We have our right to be told exact things and not cooked issues. "We have cross-checked and found out that there are so many mistakes in the forms. "The tallying forms are wrongly filled," Mr Ahmed said. TENSION Because of the objection, Mr Chikophe called the security officers to rescue the situation so that he could proceed with the announcement. But that was not possible because chaos erupted when the RO and the candidate began fighting, breaking ballot boxes in the process. Mr Chikophe and a few other people were injured. That notwithstanding, he went ahead to declare Mr Muthama the winner after the disgruntled Ahmed left the room.

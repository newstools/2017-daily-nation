Hi Brenda,I m 24 years and in a stable relationship. My boyfriend is a fanatic of a political party that I don t support and neither does my family. He wears their t-shirts even to family functions and almost came to blows one day arguing with my brother about politics. I understand he is passionate but I feel agitated whenever he starts getting excited. So much so that I am thinking of calling it quits, at least until this election season is over! What should I do?First of all, allegiance to a political party is an individual right. It isn't something you can take away from another.That said, healthy progressive relationships are about tolerance. Sharing different political views doesn't mean that the two of you are incompatible. It just means that you are individuals with varying views points.Politics, especially when two people are on different sides, can be a touchy subject. You will do well to steer clear of political debates with your boyfriend. Find other interests that the two of you share. You'll realise that politics is just one piece of the many that life is made of. It shouldn't be what your life revolves around.Got a problem for Brenda?

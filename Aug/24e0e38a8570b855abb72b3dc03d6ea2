IN LONDON Kenya relinquished the World 800 title when World Under-20 champion Kipyegon Bett settled for bronze at London’s Olympic Stadium on Tuesday. Frenchman Pierre-Ambroise Bosse stunned the field to give his country its first World 800m title in 1 minute; 44.67 seconds as Adam Kszczot from Poland glided in for silver in 1:44.95. Bett was forced to settle for bronze in 1:45.21 after his effort to edge out Bosse on the home straight failed as Kszczot passed him. Bett's bronze came minutes after Conseslus Kipruto had won gold in men's 3,000m steeplechase to see Kenya go top of the medal standings with sevens medals; three gold, one silver and three bronze. "I live a dream, I'm in a dream right now, am I dreaming?" gasped Bosse. Bosse produced a stunning burst with 150m to go, passing Bett and race favourite Nijel Amos of Botswana. He had opened a gap of several metres as they hit the finishing straight with Amos toiling and Bett one-paced. Kszczot came bursting from the back, eating up the ground between himself and Bosse but the Frenchman dug deep to fend off his rival and take the gold. Amos, who had earned the favourite's tag after world record holder David Rudisha — the man who beat him in the 2012 Olympic final — withdrew before the championships injured, faded badly to finish fifth. Amos, whose team-mate Isaac Makwala has gone down with the norovirus, had set out at a breakneck pace along with Canada's Brandon McBride but they were both unable to sustain their efforts, with the latter finishing last.

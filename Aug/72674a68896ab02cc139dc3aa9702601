National Police Service has denied claims that its officers raided National Super Alliance (Nasa) offices on Friday night. In a statement, Police Spokesperson George Kinoti said the allegations are not true and that Nasa has not yet reported the incident at any police station. “These allegations are untrue and further wish to state that no such report of a burglary has been made to any police station,” Mr Kinoti said. Nasa flag bearer Raila Odinga's spokesman Dennis Onyango had issued a statement saying police in hoods and guns had raided different offices. “A few minutes to 8pm Friday, police in hoods and armed with AK47 and machine guns raided different offices that host operations of the Opposition National Super Alliance and held staff, mostly young university and college students on internship, hostage, forcing them to lie on the floor for hours then took away all their equipment. "...The raiders also broke down and ferried away surveillance cameras, desktop computers, computer servers, Ipads and laptops in addition to taking photos of the identification documents of all the staff," he said.

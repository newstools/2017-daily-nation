IN LONDON Kenya’s World Under-20 champion Kipyegon Bett, Ferguson Rotich and Emmanuel Korir won their respectively heats to storm the semi-finals of the 800m on Saturday at the World Championships at Olympic Stadium, London. Bett ran a highly tactical race, preferring to stay behind in second place as they passed through 200m in 24.84 seconds and at the bell at 51.59. Bett took the lead from Swede Andreas Karmer just before beating the 600m mark in 1:18.37 before remaining unchallenged to win the first heat in 1:45.76 and qualify for the semi-finals due Sunday evening. Karner finished second in 1:45.98 to qualify alongside American Drew Windle in 1:46.08. “The occasionally wet and windy conditions here are just the same we trained in during the camp and personal training in Kericho," said Bett, the 2015 World Under-18 800m silver medallist. “I went easy but I know competition will get tighter in the semi-finals.” Bett will be out not only to ensure Kenya retains the World 800m title with the defending champion David Rudisha out with an injury but also improve on his personal best time of 1:43.76. Rotich, who is making his third appearance at the World event, took control of the race, hitting at 400m in 51.95 and 600m in 1:09.06 before winning the third heat in 1:45.77. Isaiah Harris (USA) and Elliot Giles (Britain) came in in 1:45.82 and 1:45.86 to also sail through.   Korir stayed second before charging to the front at the home straight to win in the fourth heat in 1:47.08, beating Michal Rozmys from Poland in 1:47.09.       Omae and Kibet all failed to qualify for the semis.

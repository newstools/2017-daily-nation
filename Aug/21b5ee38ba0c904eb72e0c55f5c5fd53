I think the Kenya Premier League s Independent Disciplinary and Complaints Committee was a bit lenient on Moses Adagala, the Muhoroni Youth chairman when they banned him from accessing any football stadium in Kenya for two months.This is one man who should face a life time ban from football anywhere in the world. From acting like a rogue bull in a china shop threatening everybody around him and even journalists, this is the face of impunity of Kenyan football.Being the chairman of a football club requires some form of decorum.I can t even start imagining the chairman of Gor Mahia Ambrose Rachier behaving like Adagala. We would send him home the very same day.I am glad that Adagala s club was cumulatively fined Sh1 million for separate incidents of trouble caused by their fans and players in matches against Kakamega Homeboyz, Sony Sugar and Ulinzi Stars this season.I am further delighted that Adagala s team will also forfeit three points from the abandoned league assignment against Homeboyz, which ended after a section of Muhoroni players turned rowdy.This is what the ruling said: The facts relayed above and in the oral hearing, confirm that Mr Moses Adagala and Muhoroni Youth Football Club are guilty of the charges laid against them. The tribunal finds Mr Adagala guilty of violating Rule 3.3 and fines him personally Sh200,000. Given that he is the chair of the club, it is imperative that he leads by good example. In addition to the fine, he is suspended from attending any KPL matches for the next 60 days, from the date of this ruling. However, I think the man escaped lightly.He is what the legal heads call a repeat offender and banning him for life would have done Kenyan football a lot of justice.And it would not have been the first time. Years ago there was a team called Baruti FC whose players beat up a referee by the name Jacob Williams Ngaah.The players concerned got a life ban and I don t think they ever took to the field again.By banning Adagala for life football authorities would have sent a strong message once and for all to all hooligans that they have no place in Kenyan football.It is a good thing that the Football Kenya Federation indefinitely banned the Muhoroni stadium from hosting any competitive assignments owing to security fears.That is the way it should be. email print email print Using their vast coaching experience, the three can develop a winning squad.

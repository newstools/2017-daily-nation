Police in Siaya County have launched a manhunt for an Administration Police Officer, who shot dead his wife in Gem Sub-County late Monday night. Mercy Muhenje, also an AP officer attached to the Yala AP camp, was on night duty when her husband, identified as Walter Magamu, shot her twice following a family dispute. Police said the officer took off with the gun and disposed it at a nearby thicket. According to Josphine Onunga, the Siaya County Commissioner, Mr Magamu snatched the weapon assigned to his wife before shooting her. DOMESTIC SQUABBLES “She was on patrol when her husband grabbed her gun and shot her twice on the chest killing her instantly. We will stop at nothing until the man is arrested,” she said. The young couple had reportedly been embroiled in domestic squabbles since January this year. “We have information that the young family has had issues for the past six months and we believe those issues might have lead to the police officer's death,” said Mrs Onunga. The body of the slain AP officer has since been moved to the Siaya County Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting post mortem.

It was a scene to behold at Dandora Primary School polling station on Tuesday morning when a man with a terminal disease that forces him to use an oxygen cylinder turned up to cast his vote. John Nyakundi, 53, suffered lung disease two years ago and uses oxygen therapy. Mr Nyakundi who has an oxygen concentrator in his house, to ease the burden of hospital bills, said that he must vote to elect a leader who will ensure affordable health services for people like him. "By exercising my democratic right through voting, I hope the person of my choice wins hence help in paying for my medication which has left me in a desperate condition," Mr Nyakundi said.

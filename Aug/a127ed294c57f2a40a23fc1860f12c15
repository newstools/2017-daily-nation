Host Western Stima played out a 1-1 draw with AFC Leopards in a mid-week Sportpesa Premier League match at Moi stadium in Kisumu.Ugandan forward Villa Oromchan struck for the powermen in the 34th minute, before Aziz Okaka restored parity for Ingwe on the stroke of half time. We played well today but we have to blame ourselves for numerous chances we failed to utilise. We also need to work on our defence which gifted our opponents the equaliser, said Western Stima coach Henry Omino, after the match.The visitors had a bright start with Ray Omondi testing Western Stima custodian Samuel Odhiambo with an early free kick that he parried over the bar for the first corner of the encounter in the third minute.A minute later, new signing Oromchan responded for the home side with a dangerous lowly shot that put former goalkeeper Gabriel Andika well put to task.Oromchan had another glaring chance to break the deadlock in the 20th minute but his header missed the target after some good work from diminutive Ezekiel Otuoma.Oromchan made amends minutes later as the Ingwe s defensive lapse gifted him all the room he wanted to slot in the opener in the 34th minute.Four minutes later, Robert Matano s Ingwe were again caught napping when Oromchan picked a pass from the centre of the pack, raced past Dennis Sikhayi only for his shot from just outside the 18-yard box spiralling over the bar. However, Okaka capitalised on miscommunication between defender Maurice Ojwang and Odhiambo seconds to the break to slot in the equaliser in an empty net.On the restart, Matano summoned Samuel Ndungu for tired legs of Vincent Oburu in bid to refresh up his team.Omondi will blame himself for not appearing in the score sheet as early as 52nd minute, when he managed to beat Stima s defence but delayed to lash a shot only for the ball to be snatched from his feet by Junior Mukisa.With the home side now on the receiving end, Omino called to action Hamadi Mbumba for Oromchan four minutes past the hour mark.Sula Bagala and Robert Achema then came in for Brian Marita and Bernard Ondiek in the 71st minute as Leopards continued to make in-roads into Stima s defense comfortably.A late introduction of Marselas Ingotsi for Kitenge Alexis was not enough to hand the visitors all the three points at full time whistle despite dominating proceeding in the entire second half. I am satisfied with the way the way the boys are responding to my instruction. This is work in progress and we are destined for better, said Matano whose side was unlucky once again to break the jinx against the hosts. email print email print Posta Rangers hit Tusker to go top of the league.

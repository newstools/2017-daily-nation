Hi Brenda,I am romantically involved with a married man. We have been physically intimate once. I have a loyal boyfriend who many women would die for. I know what I am doing is wrong and it won t end well. Please advice.It s good that you know what you are doing is wrong and that this will not end well for you. What you need to figure out is why you feel the need to stray without your relationship and address it.Are you feeling unfulfilled in your relationship? If so, deal with the problem that you may have with your boyfriend. The reason the grass looks greener on the other side is that the owners water it. Are you simply looking for some excitement? If you are, I ll tell you that excitement in romantic relationships is overrated. Your long-term partner will not excite you all the time.There is no easy way to do this. Just rip off the band aid. End things with the married man and try and work out things with your boyfriend. If things are beyond repair with him, seek a man who is available. Got a question for Brenda?

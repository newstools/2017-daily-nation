Nine people, among them a four-year-old girl, died when a 14-seater matatu and a lorry crashed on the Kisumu-Kericho highway. The figure also includes the drivers of both vehicles. County Commander James Mugera confirmed the incident. The accident took place on Sunday afternoon at the Nyaberia corner, near the Kipsitet trading centre.   The driver of the lorry, which was coming from Kericho town, is said to have lost control of the vehicle before colliding with the matatu that had 11 passengers on board. Witnesses said the lorry started hooting several metres away as the driver negotiated the dangerous corner, prompting pedestrians to scamper for safety. DEATHThe witnesses said eight people died on the spot and the bodies were taken to a mortuary by police officers. Four other people, including the lorry driver, were taken to hospital in critical condition. The driver however died later. Former Roads minister Franklin Bett, who arrived at the scene, said it was unfortunate that nine people died in an incident that could have been prevented. “I am told the lorry driver learnt of brake failure several kilometres away but continued driving. The behaviour of some motorists on our roads is wanting,” Mr Bett said.   He called on the Roads ministry and the National Transport and Safety Authority to step up efforts in ensuring that both roads and vehicles are in a good state. “Vehicle owners should be responsible. They should maintain their vehicles while drivers should not work for more than eight hours,” he said. Mr Edwin Omondi said the matatu had made a stopover at Awasi centre to pick up more passengers. “Two of the people who died were about to board my car but when the vehicle pulled over, they rushed to the matatu,” Mr Omondi said. “I followed the matatu and before I knew it, there was a cloud of smoke,” he added. Mr Mugera said the bodies have been taken to Kericho District Hospital Mortuary.

The Nyanza region security team escaped unhurt after their helicopter made an emergency landing in Migori County. The team was carrying out surveillance in the afternoon when the mishap occured at a farm in Rapogi, Uriri sub-county. Police say the chopper, model 5Y-SFA, was flying to Migori when it developed mechanical problem.   The team had successfully visited Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay counties. Mr Joseph Nthenge, the county police commandant, said all the occupants disembarked safely. The team from Nairobi sent to repair the chopper was not successful in carrying out their task. The first attempted take-off after 'repair' failed.

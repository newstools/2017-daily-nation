Hallo Brenda,I have dated this lady that I love for two years and a few months. Our ride has been okay generally with all the normal hiccups. She recently got a job in Qatar as an accountant. Everything has been confirmed and she has chosen to accept the offer. We have agreed she work for two years after which she will settle down with me. Before she leaves, she has promised that I will meet her family. I kind of trust her though it s somehow confusing. Do you think a break of two years can ruin things? Two things, a long-distance relationship can work but it also requires extra hard work and commitment.If the two of you have agreed to hold onto the commitment, then there should be no problem. Just make sure you're on the same page with regard to where it's all headed.Refrain from hurrying the relationship by making big decisions like engagement or marriage just because she is leaving. If a woman isn't committed to a relationship, even a rock on her finger will not keep her.Let the relationship take its course. If it's headed down the aisle, then it will happen when the two of you get to that point. Got a problem for Brenda?

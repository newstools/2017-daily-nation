AÂ report detailing the risks meat lovers are exposing themselves to on a daily basis has laid bare the extent of the rot in the domestic animal health care system. The study has revealed that meat and other animal-based foods contain high levels of dangerous antibiotic residues. It said the chemicals, also found in chicken and pork, have previously been linked to cancer, allergies and other complications. Though the study was confined to only a small area of Thika and Gatundu in Kiambu County, it highlights basic but pernicious gaps in our animal health delivery system. POULTRY Most farmers who keep cattle and poultry do not bother and do not even feel compelled to seek the services of qualified veterinary officers. Livestock owners simply walk into agrovet shops, pick up drugs, some of them fake, and administer them to the animals as they wish without any regard to dosage guidelines, possible side effects or time lines that must be observed before the meat products are consumed. Abattoirs also rarely observe critical guidelines before releasing their products into the market because of lack of stringent public health supervision. The Health ministry must develop a system to ensure that livestock owners show proof that their meat products have been certified by qualified veterinary officers before they reach the market. It must safeguard the health of Kenyans.

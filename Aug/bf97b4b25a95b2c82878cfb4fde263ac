A modern waste management system would be established in Kajiado following a partnership between the Italian government and the county. The Sh2.1 billion plan would involve the relocation of Ngong dumpsite in six month’s time. Governor Joseph ole Lenku, who on Friday visited the dumpsite in the company of Environment Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli, said his government had prioritised the relocation of the dumpsite and had made it a flagship project. “This dumpsite is not only an eyesore, it is also an environmental and health hazard, being so close to the town,” Mr Lenku said. PLASTICS BANGovernor Ole Lenku added that the Kajiado County Government would work with the national government through the Ministry of Environment to ensure that the ban on plastic bags is successfully implemented. “We want to thank the government through the Ministries of Environment and Finance for helping us secure the financing for the waste management project,” Mr Lenku said.

He added the EIA study will form the basis of similar waste disposal management in other major urban centres in Kajiado like Kitengela, Rongai and Loitokitok. RELOCATIONMr Lenku sought to allay fears that the relocation will be hampered by controversy surrounding the new site at the government veterinary land in Ngong. There had been fears that the Keekonyokie community, which has been claiming ownership of the land, was opposed to the planned relocation. “That issue shall be sorted; the most important thing is this dumpsite will be removed from here,” the governor said.

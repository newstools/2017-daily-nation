Rapper MI is angry with the passing of anti-gay laws in Nigeria. The Chocolate City hip hop star made his views public when a fan on Twitter expressed his disapproval on the star s opinion. MI however defended his stance by pointing out that adultery and cheating are wrong but are not criminalised.MI was speaking during his podcast called The Middle Ground and made reference to a case where a lady was assaulted by a Taxify driver after she jokingly claimed she was a lesbian to rebuff his advances. My thinking I was born straight. I would never want to be punished for who I am because of this, I would never punish someone else for who they are, he wrote on Twitter. Cheating and adultery are wrong but they are not criminalised and no form of consensual adult expression of love should be. My opinion. The conversation soon turned into a back and forth situation with some of his fans like @offwallace who wanted to know why there should be same sex attraction. I m not arguing that there should be, I have and am only attracted to women, I m also a Christian that aspires to God s teachings on sex, he tweeted.On his podcast, the rapper sad that Nigeria is years away from having a conversation about homosexuality or transgender. My personal take it s not my business what anybody does, everybody has a right to privacy. email print email print

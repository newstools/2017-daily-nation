After nine months of inactivity, the national women’s football team is set to make a maiden appearance in the Cosafa women’s tournament in Zimbabwe. The event next month will be the senior team’s first engagement since last November, when they participated in the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, where they were knocked out in the group stage. Compared with the number of games played by the men’s national team (four), this is certainly inadequate for the Harambee Starlets, who were runners-up in the Cecafa Women’s Championship in Jinja in September last year, and who represented the country in Africa’s premier football showpiece last year, but are now regrouping after nine months of dormancy. However, the competition should go a long way in helping the women to stay in shape ahead of the rigorous 2018 Afcon qualifiers beginning next year. One hopes, though, that going forward, more attention will be paid to the women’s football team to enable the girls to maintain the impressive run they have had in the last two years. Thankfully, the juniors are learning the ropes quite fast. They beat The Zebras of Botswana 7-1 in the first leg of the first round of the 2018 Fifa U-20 World Cup qualifiers in Botswana this month to progress to the next stage of qualifiers. This progress should be consolidated.

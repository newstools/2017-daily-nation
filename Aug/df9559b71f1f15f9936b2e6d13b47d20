Dear Brenda,I have been married for two years and we have a one-year-old daughter. I love this girl but my relatives say that she isn t mine because she doesn t resemble me in any way. It is frustrating to hear that. What should I do to save my marriage? To begin with, basic biology will tell you that a child s DNA comes from both parents. This means that he or she might resemble one parent or the other or have distinct features from both. Your daughter not looking exactly like you is not proof that she is not yours.If you believe there is a chance that she is not yours, then get proof through a paternity test. These are now locally available. Before you do so, be sure you are ready for any outcome.As a father and a husband, your job is to shield your family from the outside world. This includes your relatives. If this is your daughter and even if she isn t and you decide to stay in her life, you need to shield her from the world.Got a problem you want to share with Brenda?

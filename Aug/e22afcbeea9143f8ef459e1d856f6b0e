Independent presidential candidate Joseph Nyagah has appealed to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to address hacking claims made by Nasa in order to forestall possible chaos. Mr Nyagah said the claims by Raila Odinga are serious and need to be tackled without delay. VIOLENCE Addressing the press at his Rwika home in Embu County, Mr Nyagah said similar allegations were made in 2007 before the post-election erupted. Mr Nyagah was a member of the ODM Pentagon in 2007. "I have the advantage of having gone through [a] similar scenario 10 years ago. "IEBC should listen to those who are complaining over rigging claims because failure could cause chaos. IEBC must re-assure all Kenyans," he said. ICC Mr Nyaga, presently with 36,841 votes, said he is awaiting the final tally. He said he would consult both Nasa and Jubilee leaders to look for a peaceful way to resolve the emerging issue. "I have an advantage of having been an Independent candidate and I know leaders from both sides well. "We must avoid what happened in 2007/8 when thousands died, many became refugees and IDPs, and we ended up taking ourselves to ICC rather foolishly," he cautioned. DEFEATMr Nyaga said he would be waiting for his agents at the nation tallying centre at Bomas of Kenya before he concedes defeat, though his counterpart Dr Japheth Kavinga has already done so. He urged Kenyans to be calm as they wait for the official announcement.   Election officials must start counting presidential ballots the minute voting closes.

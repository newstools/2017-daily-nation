He lost to Governor Martin Wambora in the August 8 General Election. The High Court in Embu ordered that all election materials used in the poll be preserved. KIEMS KITSJustice Florence Muchemi also ordered that all Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System kits used in the Embu gubernatorial election be kept safely. “The orders should remain in force pending the hearing and determination of this case, which will be heard on September 20,” Justice Muchemi said. The election materials to be kept safely include counted ballot papers and rejected ones, ballot boxes, written statements by presiding officers, printed copies of the register used in the disputed poll and copies of the results of each polling station where the outcome has raised queries.

Madaraka Express train tickets will from Wednesday next week display the name and identity card number of passengers. The move by Kenya Railways is aimed at kicking middlemen out of the ticketing business. Since June, middlemen have been buying tickets in bulk and selling them to passengers outside train stations in Mombasa and Nairobi. The shrewd middlemen have been buying tickets at a normal price of Sh700 and selling at them at Sh1,000 and above, thereby creating artificial shortages. “We have now customised the system and effective 8th August, tickets will bear the name and identity card or passport details of the passengers and will not be transferable. This will enhance the requisite security of all passengers and curtail the irregular sale of tickets by middlemen,” said Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina. The service will, however, take a break Tuesday during the General Election.

Dear Brenda, I’m a second-year student in university and I had drunk sex with a classmate a month ago. I wasn’t really into him but he invited me to his room for a drink and one thing led to another. Cliché, I know, but now I have just discovered I’m pregnant. Needless to say, this is the world’s worst timing, and I want to have an abortion. Part of me wants to keep it though. I’m also wondering whether to tell him or not. Seriously, I’m not ready for baby-daddy drama in case he denies responsibility. Please help me think through this. My dear girl. You should have been ready for baby-daddy drama the minute you decided to have unprotected sex. But this is not the time to reprimand you. This, indeed, must be a very confusing time for you. As far as I can see, you have two choices here: To keep or not to keep the baby. Whatever choice you make, your life and your body will change irrevocably. The baby-daddy also has a choice to be in your baby’s life or not (should you decide to keep it) but only if you tell him about it. It’s also time to take full responsibility of your actions. Saying the baby has the worst timing suggests that the baby had a choice here. The baby did not but you two adults did. Visit your campus clinic to receive professional help with the pregnancy and a full list of options you can take up. Remember that adoption is one of them. I wish you all the best.

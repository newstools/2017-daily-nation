President Uhuru Kenyatta has said former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto is welcome back to the Jubilee fold despite being one of the principals in the National Super Alliance. At the inauguration of Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso on Tuesday, the President said Mr Ruto has shown political maturity by conceding and accepting to hand over power. "You have shown that you are a true man. I want to ask you to come back. You don’t have to stay with that man of riddles,” he said referring to opposition leader Raila Odinga. Mr Ruto wore dark glasses throughout the ceremony. In his address, he said he was ready to work with Dr Laboso. "I did what I could in those four years. Now it is her turn to do her duties. I have assured her that I remain a citizen (resident) of Bomet and you will not see me squabbling with you. Because we cannot grow our county if we keep wrangling," said the former governor. During the ceremony, the President said the election of Dr Laboso as governor proves Jubilee Party is supportive of gender equality. Dr Laboso said she is ready to work with competitors but warned that she will not condone corruption. She said employees’ documents will be checked as well as financial records of the county. She argued the audit of the county records will not be a witch-hunt because she wants to work with a lean and efficient workforce. "As the governor of Bomet, I shall serve all of you without discrimination,” she said.

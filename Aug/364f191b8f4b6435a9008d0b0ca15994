Nairobi County Governor Mike Sonko has said he will not sack any county staff inherited from the previous regime, but warned that those found to be corrupt will not be spared. Addressing journalists on Tuesday at City Hall, Mr Sonko said his administration would not victimise any worker on the basis of who they supported during the General Election. “In many counties workers have been fired but we will not do that here in Nairobi. Let us stop sacking workers just to settle political vendetta,” said the governor. A number of county governments have suspended or sacked workers. CORRUPT Mr Sonko asked the governors to respect rights of workers and only sack those who are corrupt. “I have retained the employees and even the guy who was preparing tea for Mr Kidero is still working for me. Even the typists and receptionists,” he said. Mr Sonko appealed to chief officers, who were working for former Governor Evans Kidero to support him in creating a better Nairobi. “I know those who did not vote for me and supported my opponent but elections are now over. Let us work together to the betterment of Nairobi. Politicking is now over,” he said. LAW However, he warned corrupt staff that their days were numbered and that they would not be allowed to work in Nairobi County. Acting on his warning, Governor Sonko ordered immediate suspension of a chief cashier and his officers, who were found in custody of more than Sh7 million when he paid an impromptu visit to their offices at City Hall. He ordered the acting County Secretary Mr Leboo ole Morintat to ensure that the officer and his team did not report to work until investigations are complete. At the same time, Mr Sonko allayed fears that county askaris would be sacked en mass by the county terming the claims propaganda. “Let them (askaris) go on with their work but let them do their work according to the law,” he said.

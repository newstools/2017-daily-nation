Police in Mombasa County have gunned down a most wanted terror suspect. Hussein Said Omar was shot dead at around 6pm in Bamburi, Kisauni sub-county, on Friday. MANHUNT Coast regional Police boss Larry Kieng said the suspect had been pursued for the last two years. "He has been on the list of most wanted terror suspects," Mr Kieng said. "It happened here at Mwembelegeza. The men in the car opened fire at him and sped away," a source said. ACCOMPLICE Omar, alias Babli, was believed to be an accomplice of slain terror suspect Ismail Shosi, who was gunned down in Kisauni on September 2016. Babli had escaped police dragnets since 2015. Police say he shared a house with Shosi in Mwandoni. He is the younger brother of fugitive Ahmed Said Omar alias Dogo, and both are suspects in the 2014 Mpeketoni massacre, according to police reports.

Six people have recorded statements on the murder of IEBC ICT Manager Chris Msando, police have said. Inspector-General Joseph Boinnet on Thursday said detectives were hunting for four other persons of interest. Mr Msando was strangled, a post-mortem revealed on Wednesday. Chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor said: “He died from strangulation and he also had incisions on his right arm, but the rest of the body was intact.” The ICT boss went missing on Friday evening and his body was found together with that of 21-year-old Carol Ngumbu at Muguga Forest in Kikuyu on Saturday. DETECTIVES Investigations into the murders continued on Wednesday, with acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i saying the best detectives were on the case. The detectives, the Nation learnt, are keen on completing a trail of Mr Msando’s final movements, hoping they will find out the route he took after his car was last captured by CCTV cameras on the road. Police believe another woman captured by the cameras in Mr Msando’s vehicle may hold the key to the murder puzzle. With the help of mobile phone service providers, detectives also want to trace the last points of contact before his cell phones went silent. Police were looking for his phones on Wednesday. The body was found stripped to the underwear and officers want to get a hold of the clothes he wore that night to extract DNA material helpful in tracking down the killers.   Government pathologist, private medic and Msando’s relatives witness post-mortem.

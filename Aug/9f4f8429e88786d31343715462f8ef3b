The National Olympics Committee of Kenya (Nock) is now free to hold its elections, the High Court ruled on Wednesday. Judge Enock Chacha Mwita set aside the orders blocking the polls obtained by the Kenya Taekwondo Association (KTA) on May 5 this year. Justice Mwita made the decision after all parties failed to reach an out of court settlement as per the court’s directive on Monday. The judge asked the parties to carry on with the polls now that the order stopping it had been lifted. Lawyer Kimutai Bosek for KTA told the judge that all the parties were ready to reach an out of court settlement but the Ministry of Sports. which is opposed to some stakeholders in the sports industry from participating in the elections. Mr Bosek argued that if Nock does not hold elections the country risks being banned by the International Olympics Committee (IOC). “ KTA wants the elections being held that is why it was opting for an out of court settlement,” Mr Bosek told the judge. Lawyers defending other interested parties were perturbed by the stand taken by the Ministry saying “it was not for the good for the sports industry in the country.” However, the judge was asked to lift the injunction issued on May 5 2017 after a complaint by KTA, that it had been barred from participating in the polls. KTA moved to court after it was stopped from nominating a representative to participate in the exercise due its factionary wrangles. KTA argued that it is recognised member of NOCK with a voting authority. The move paves the way for five time World Cross Country champion Paul Tergat to be elected as president Tergat is poised to take over the reigns of Nock from long serving chair Kipchoge Keino.   The settlement will pave way for NOCK elections which were postponed two months ago.

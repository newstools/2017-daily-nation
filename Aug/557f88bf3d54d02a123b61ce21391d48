A 75-year-old man caused a stir at the Lamu Fort polling station Tuesday after he refused to be marked with indelible ink as a sign that he had voted, saying it was against his religion “to paint his fingernails”. IEBC officials had to convince Mr Ali Mohamed Miji to agree to have ink applied on his left little finger shortly after he cast his vote at the polling station. He complained that his religion does not allow him to paint his nails in any way and thus refused to be marked. He insisted that it was a sin for him to paint his nails and added that he was worried that his prayers would not be accepted by Allah if he lifts a painted finger towards him. 'MERE PROTOCOL' Mr Miji said he would not allow “a mere election protocol to put spoil the good relationship he has with his God”. “I have voted but I don’t want any paint to be applied on any part of my body. They want to paint may nail with ink. Once I begin washing my legs and hands at (the) mosque, that will mean water will not reach my body since the ink will prevent it. FEAR OF HELL “How do I lift my hands to Allah in prayer when one of my fingers is painted? If I do that it means I will burn in hell and that’s not my portion. Voting shouldn’t put me at war with my Allah,” said an agitated Mr Miji. It took the intervention of the presiding officer at the centre, Mrs Hawa Bile Mohamed, who maintained that Mr Miji had to have his small finger nail marked with the ink as that was the rule. Family members had to also intervene and convince the elderly man to “just accept and be marked and go home”. The old man later gave in after his pleas to be “spared from hell fire” fell on deaf ears. He left the station cursing and praying for Allah’s forgiveness at the same time.

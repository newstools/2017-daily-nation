The Kenyan Premier League had reached its halfway line and by now my good friend Peter Leftie and his noisy gang of Ingwe followers know where the title is headed.The last three matches have given a clear indication that Gor Mahia is going to be the league champions in November.Our new coach Dylan Kerr has picked up from where Brazilian Jose Marcello Ferreira a.k.a Ze Maria left.Remember I told you here a few weeks ago that after our clash with English Premier League side Everton, local sides should prepare for the real Mahia.Ask Nakumatt what befell them in our two meetings over the last one week.As Gor Mahia, we hate bragging, but we are just reminding our opponents to be wary of us and if we beat them they must always accept and move on.Recent history has shown that any team that collects even a point from Gor Mahia will have it rough in their subsequent games. Why do I say that? Ask Western Stima who beat us some time ago.They spent their next eight games looking for a win of course until they met their age mates AFC Leopards. And what of Mathare United, and most recently Ulinzi Stars?We are Gor Mahia and we just do not lose like that, we ensure we cast a spell that will ensure you lose your next three games.Back to our technical bench and my brother Peter Leftie and his ilk will by now have realised how we have always been successful with British-born coaches.The British association with Gor is best remembered way back with Len Julians who won with us the East and Central Africa club championships in 1985 in Sudan.Bobby Williamson ended our 18-year title drought, and just recently Frank Nuttall who won the league unbeaten with us.Now we have Kerr and we are definitely going for another success made in Britain.But even as we Gor Mahia play big league football, we hope Ingwe will get their act together and get back to being our worthy opponents.As Gor Mahia we are sad when we win league titles and Ingwe are struggling against relegation.It is sad that estate sides like Kariobangi Sharks and village sides like Zoo Kericho are now doing better than Ingwe, what a shame! As Gor Mahia, we are begging Ingwe to go out there and get players who will march Gor Mahia stars so that one day they will be able to play at least Watford FC as we play Barcelona or Bayern Munich.Over to you Peter Leftie. email print email print The important point is that a club needs to take advantage of its home ground.

At the beginning of this movie, the obnoxious resemblance of the main character to the other obnoxious main character in Girlboss, put me off the movie. They both acted like privileged whiny and entitled – no, I’m not going to say millennial – girls living in a big city. But whereas the fictionalised harpying of the latter show did not wear off, leading to Netflix cancelling the show, thank goodness, this character grows on you. By the time the movie came to an end, I was clapping. Jessica James is a struggling playwright who has just been dumped by her boyfriend for reasons she is yet to understand. She kind of starts dating again, but really only to spite him, only to meet someone else who isn’t over their ex either. Jessica James is funny, and forward, and reminds you of truths about a woman living in this century that you may have forgotten, but are glad to be reminded of. No, I still don’t think she could have taken over from Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, but she’s definitely a good egg.

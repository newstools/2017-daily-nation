Kenya’s Olympic 800m bronze medallist Margaret Nyairera easily won her 800m heat in 2:00.75 on Thursday to reach the semi-finals due for Friday evening. Nyairera hit the front for the first time just after the 600m mark to win in 2 minutes and 00.75 seconds, beating Lynsey Sharp from Britain and Ugandan Halima Nakaayi to second and third places in 2:01.04 and 2:01.80. Defending champion Marina Arzamasova from Belarus was the major casualty when she finished fourth in a season’s best of 2:01.92 but failed to sail through. Kenya’s other representative Emily Cherotich also failed to qualify when finished sixth in 2:02.70 in the first heat won by Angelika Cichocka from Poland in 2:00.86 with other medal favourite Melissa Bishop coming home second. “I knew I had the defending champion in the mix hence I didn’t want to take any chances,” said Nyairera, the 2014 World Junior 800m champion. “I have to run well and qualify for the final now that I am alone.” As expected, South Africa’s Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya, who is also the 2009 World 800m champion, and Olympic 800m silver medallist Francine Niyonsaba won their heats to qualify for the semi-finals.

Singer Akothee, on countless occasions has made it clear that she does not care what people think or say about her. She does not also care that people think her wealth comes from sponsors. So it s no surprise that she really does not care how you think she managed to build her parents a house.The singer took to Instagram and showed off the house with an unapologetic caption. Part of it reads: I can courageously walk into my parents compound and park my big car in front of their house without any guilt , I can slay and travel business class knowing my parents are sleeping in a cool place , I might seem mad to you , but just know this idiot is too sharp and focused in life. Losers will say I m proving a point , cowards will say I m a ritualist, unlucky ladies will say money from sponsors, lazy men will call me a prostitute for having children and failed relationships, she wrote.But she was not done yet, letting those that think she is bragging that this is just the beginning, that she is yet to arrive . Never mistake knowledge for wisdom, I m too wise to live a fake life, this is me, take me or live me, you are allowed to be proud of your accomplishments and admire your efforts , if you feel I m bragging then just wait , I haven t offended you yet , there is nothing to brag about here. I haven t arrived in my comfort zone, when I will land there then you will know that I have surely arrived. The rate at which I will brag even God knows that s why it s taking too long to reach there. Even Amerka will know that maskini amepata, nitawasumbua mpaka Panadol ziishe kwa duka wrote Akothee. email print email print Singer Akothee, on countless occasions has made it clear that she does not care what people think or say about her.

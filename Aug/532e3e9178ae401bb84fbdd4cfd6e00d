By the time you are reading this the Mighty Gor Mahia will have taught those sorry looking guys by the name of AFC Leopards some football lesson.Looking at the log and the way we are going I doubt if there is any team that can stop us.I mean if one of the world s greatest players Wayne Rooney tasted the wrath of K Ogalo, which team in this our neck of the woods can stand against us?None, and I repeat, none at all.With a mean defence and a striking force that is always hungry for goals, I can assure all the teams we are facing to be ready for some hiding.My request to the club officials is to train their sights on the continental campaigns next year.We have the pedigree to take on any team on this continent.NEXT LEVELAll we need to do is to give the coach the leeway to pick the players he wants and take us to the next continental glory.I am happy that we have a coach who is emphatic.If you doubt just see the way he has told off his predecessor Ze Maria over overtures on our player Kenneth Muguna.Away from this, the other issue I want to address today is the number of politicians who want to ride on the back of our beloved club to further their political ambitions.We saw in the last campaigns how politicians cashed in on our popularity in a bid to look for votes.We saw some of them sponsor fans to travel to Dar es Salaam to support the team at the SportPesa tournament. I also saw a female aspirant sponsor a particular branch of the club.The supporters would come to the stadium with huge banners emblazoned with the lady s pictures and sing songs in her praises.To the many young men and women who were benefiting from this it was all fine.Getting someone to pay for your way into the stadium or even buy you lunch is not a bad thing.However, in the bigger picture this is a bad trend.We need to have our club above any political affiliation to the extent that anybody in the world - and yes Gor Mahia is an international brand - can feel comfortable supporting this great club.Maybe there are some who benefit from this unholy trinity but they must be told that their selfish interests must be curtailed in the interest of our club. email print email print The results will speak for us.

Some workers of the national broadcaster KBC have boycotted work six days to the General Election. The staff allied to Communication Workers Union (Cowu) began their strike on Wednesday to protest management’s failure to sign and implement their Collective Bargaining Agreement. They held demos outside the State corporation’s offices on Harry Thuku Road in Nairobi. Managing Director Waithaka Waihenya, in a statement, said the delay in inking the CBA was prompted by ongoing deliberations with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). STATE AGENCY “The SRC has requested the corporation to wait for the commission’s final advice before the end of the week. KBC is a state agency and therefore bound by all the laws and rules governing state bodies.” He said the the corporation cannot sign or implement the CBA without the approval of the SRC. Cowu General-Secretary Benson Okwaro had issued a 21-day strike notice on June 14. He said the proposed salary raises were discussed following the intervention of the Ministry of East Africa Community Labour and Social Protection after Cowu threatened to call a strike in June. A source at KBC said all employees in the union have downed their tools.

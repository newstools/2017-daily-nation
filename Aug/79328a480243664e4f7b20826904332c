Though the step taken by the National Construction Authority to stop work on a building in the densely populated Zimmerman Estate in Nairobi is welcome, it has also shone the spotlight on investors who defy directives meant to ensure public safety. It is not lost on observers that, despite an order halting the works, the police failed to ensure compliance with the directive. It had to take protests from members of the public for construction to be suspended. It is also instructive that, a day later, the NCA also approved the ongoing work at another construction site in the city centre that had also raised safety concerns, prompting the work to be put on hold for several months. SAFE The authority must take every necessary step to ensure that the building, which has now been given the green light, will be safe for use when completed. With the new leadership in county governments, one of whose responsibilities is to approve building plans, the public expects greater vigilance in ensuring the safety and aesthetics of the buildings being put up. However, this ought to be done efficiently, without creating bottlenecks that would otherwise frustrate investment. The public ought to be given a hotline or other means of conveniently and effectively raising their concerns with the relevant authorities whenever they suspect a structure under construction poses a risk to safety.

I really wished they had continued to not let Aditi Mittal say anything or maybe, let her say things, but not on a stage that s supposed to make me laugh.I tried to watch this stand up twice for a couple of reasons one, I love stand up, which you know if you ve been reading my page (and if you have, thank you!), and two, because there isn t nearly enough good female stand-up comedy out there, so whenever I come across one, I usually try to give it a chance. Two tries, two long naps and two weeks later, I have officially given up. If you get to the end, (past the half hour mark, which is where I got to) let me know if it gets any better.It isn t that some of the jokes aren t quite funny, but maybe they just aren t my type of funny.Or maybe she s trying too hard to bring out the blend between Indian culture and English idiosyncrasies. email print email print

The driver is all banged up and there was this one girl bleeding out of her face pretty bad."Thirty-six people were left with minor injuries when two New York subway train cars careened off the tracks in June.The US rail network suffers from chronic underfunding and accidents are not infrequent, particularly on the busy East Coast corridor. email print email print

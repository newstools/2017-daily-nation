The defeated Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka has urged his supporters not to feel “orphaned” following his election loss. Speaking in his office in Bungoma town, Mr Lusaka, who vied on a Jubilee Party ticket and lost to Mr Wycliffe Wangamati of Ford-Kenya, said it was important for them to accept the reality. “I know I am down but not out. Politics is a matter of interest and we should focus on building the county rather than fighting each other. “I am now jobless but with God’s timing everything is possible, I am optimistic of securing another job very soon and all my supporters will be happy with it,” he said. ABABUOn his part, former Budalang’i MP Ababu Namwamba said the Luhya community is fully represented in the Jubilee government, despite voting overwhelmingly for Opposition leader Raila Odinga. The Labour Party of Kenya leader who lost to Mr Raphael Wanjala of ODM, said the fact that a significant number of locals voted for President Uhuru Kenyatta shows changing political tide in the region. JUBILEE President Uhuru Kenyatta improved his vote tally from the region this year compared to the 2013 General Election. In Kakamega, Mr Kenyatta got 63,191 votes, up from the 12,469 he got in 2013 while in Busia he got 34,000 votes up from the 8,186 he got in 2013.

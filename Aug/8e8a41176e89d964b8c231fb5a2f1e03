For the first time in nine months, the women’s senior national team has been called to camp to prepare for next month’s Cosafa Women’s Championship. The team will be assembling for the first time since last November, when they made their debut in the women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and were knocked out in the group stages. One would have expected that after their qualification for the continental showpiece, Football Kenya Federation would engage the team in more international friendlies and tournaments to keep them together ahead of the next tournament, but instead, the team has remained dormant. TRAINING Indeed, it is due to their participation in last year’s Afcon that Kenya has been invited to the tournament for the southern African countries. The women will have only two weeks of training before travelling to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Yet their opponents in the competition, Zambia, Malawi and hosts Zimbabwe, have been in residential training to enhance their chances of winning it. One hopes that Harambee Starlets will get the attention they deserve during Fifa international weeks, and that they will be engaged in international activity as much their male counterparts, Harambee Stars. This will enable them stay in good shape for important games such as the 2018 Afcon qualifiers which begin next March.

East African Cables’ #ticker:CABL chief executive Peter Arina has resigned from the company, marking the second such departure from the corner office in two years. Mr Arina’s exit coincided with a deterioration in the firm’s performance in the half-year ended June when sales, earnings and shareholder funds all dropped by double to triple digits. He was appointed CEO in October 2015 to replace George Mwangi who had resigned a month earlier to launch his start-up milk firm, Countryside Dairy. “That the resignation of Peter Arina as the chief executive officer of the company with effect from August 31, 2017 be and is hereby accepted,” EA Cables said in a statement released Tuesday. The cables manufacturer added that Paul Muigai —who has been the chief operating officer— has been appointed the acting CEO effective Tuesday (August 28). Mr Arina, who had earlier left Safaricom #ticker:SCOM as the chief commercial officer in 2014, resigned as the cable manufacturer’s net loss widened 7.4 times to Sh232.4 million in the half-year ended June.

Jockey, Didiel Osorio, has been summarily suspended by Indiana Horse Racing Commission stewards, after allegedly being in possession of an illegal electrical device. This followed the fifth race at Indiana Grand.Osorio rode the winner, Deep Explorer, 7-10, trained by Donald Habeeb.According to Stan Bowker, Indiana Horse Racing Commission investigator Toni Sperle conducted a search that began in the winner's circle, while Osorio was weighing in. Electrical devices, made from small batteries, wires and electrical tape, can be concealed in a jockey's hand during a race and are used to shock or stimulate a horse. BUZZERSCommonly referred to as buzzers, batteries or machines, they are illegal in racing and can lead to lengthy suspensions.Osorio was removed from his remaining engagements which means he will not be able to ride in any other State. An initial hearing has been set for August 22, 2017.The summary suspension, pending completion of an investigation, cites a violation of IHRC Rule #71, which declares that possession of an electrical device on the grounds of association, is against the best interest and integrity of horse racing.RANKS THIRDOsorio, a 23-year-old native of Panama, has been riding at both Indiana Grand and Ellis Park in Kentucky, where he ranks third in the current jockey standings. He began his US riding career in 2013 and has 235 wins from 2,037 mounts.Bowker said the maximum penalty the stewards can assess for possession of an electrical device is a one-year license drop, and $5,000 fine. But, if the case is referred to the commission, additional sanctions can be applied. It does not look good for Osorio right now, as he has blemished the game in an unfair way. email print email print

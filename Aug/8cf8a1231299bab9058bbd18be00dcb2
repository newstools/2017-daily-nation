Controversial blogger Robert Alai has been released from Kamukunji Police Station in Nairobi. Alai, on his Facebook page on Saturday, said: "Thanks Jomo for intervening and having this sorted. Some people are misusing the police and they misuse the name of the President too. "Four flying Squad cars? Really? Anyway, I am out," he wrote without clarifying which 'Jomo' he was referring to. ARREST Earlier, he had told the Nation that he was arrested Friday on Mombasa Road. According to him, police cars fitted with ordinary number plates blocked his vehicle, before the officers jumped out with guns. "They have not told me why I am under arrest. I do not know why I am here. They roughed me up. My shirt is torn," Mr Alai said. He added that the police had four cars when they arrested him. The blogger also thanked Kenyans for their support. "Thanks for the massive support. I received support from both the Baba and Uhuru supporters. Thanks guys. You know how much I love you." SOCIAL MEDIA Alai is active on social media, where he posts information on politics and social issues. Recently, he posted photographs of the first family that were supposedly taken in a city hospital. The caption suggested that a member of the first family had passed on.

More than 300 Kenyans hired by the Chinese operator of the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) passenger train have finally been issued with one-year renewable contracts, reducing the possibility of industrial action by the workers. The staff, including welders, coach attendants and ticketing operators, have been working without a contract from April after the expiry of their probation period that started in October. The workers had in July complained about the contract issues and warned that they would down their tools. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) hired the locals alongside Chinese workers as security personnel, train drivers and wagon technicians. The Business Daily saw a contract for a welder. “Your salary will be paid monthly on the basis of Sh84 per hour. Holidays, vacations, time offs and other related benefits will be in accordance with the company policy as explained by your supervisor. “The salary and benefits may change from time to time without affecting the other terms of your employment,” read a section of the contract.Kenya Railways and CRBC in May signed an operations, maintenance and service agreement for the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR operation.

Constructed at a cost of Sh327 billion, it is co-financed through  commercial  and semi-concessional loans from China and the Government of Kenya.

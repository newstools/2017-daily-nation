There is some good news for the health sector, which has been dogged by a countrywide nurses’ strike for more than 60 days. The absence from work of nurses, who play a critical role in the health care delivery, has disrupted operations, causing untold suffering to patients. As we hope and wait for the authorities and the nurses’ union to engage in serious negotiations and end the stalemate, there is a sign that there is concern beyond our borders about the need to ensure that Kenyans get the best medical care possible. The Global Fund’s approval of a request from the Health ministry for a grant of Sh36 billion for malaria, HIV and tuberculosis programmes is a positive development. The organisation’s boost in the campaign against these major diseases will come to naught if we fail to properly organise manpower. IMPLEMENT PROGRAMMES It’s highly unlikely that such a huge amount of money could have been released if we did not have the capacity to implement these programmes. Also of great significance is the need to properly account for expenditure and channel the money into the areas for which it is intended. The Global Fund has been known to crack down hard whenever the funds it provides are misappropriated. The Health ministry must ensure that the money is put to the intended use and accounted for to the cent. But the more urgent challenge now is to end the nurses’ strike and restore services.

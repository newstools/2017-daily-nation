Former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has been criticised for boycotting the swearing in of his successor Charity Ngilu on Monday. Speakers at Governor Ngilu’s inauguration ceremony said Dr Malombe should have humbled himself like other defeated governors and attend the ceremony to hand over power to the new county boss. Former Senator David Musila said failure to attend the ceremony was a show of contempt for Kitui people, who elected him in 2013. “Democracy is about respecting the collective will of the people as demonstrated at the ballot. I conceded defeat and congratulated our new governor and the other candidate should have done the same” Mr Musila said. Other leaders who criticises Dr Malombe for skipping the event include Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua, MPs Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) and Nyiva Mwendwa (outgoing women rep). They said he has should honourably concede defeat. Acting County Secretary Alex Kimanzi and Chief of Staff Kiema Kimoli attended the event. Mr Kimanzi told the Nation that the former governor did not give reasons for skipping the event but only communicated to the county transition committee that he won’t be attending.

Bongo R-n-B star Ben Pol and his comedian girlfriend (Anna Exavery) who goes by the stage name Ebitoke have denied claims that their relationship has fizzled out. The couple only (allegedly) recently started dating but social media users are casting their doubts on their relationship due to reports that Ben Pol was paid by Timamu TV as part of Ebitoke’s comedic acts. However Ben Pol has denied those claims and said whatever transpired between them was authentic. Ebitoke on the other hand in a radio interview revealed that they are keeping their relationship discreet. “Right now Ben Pol and I are keeping things private, I won’t say anything negative about Bentoke, because he does not post photos of me on social media,” she told Times FM. The two have been nicknamed #Bentoke, a fusion of their names. The comedian went on to say that they are planning on working together and since Ben Pol has more experience in the entertainment industry, he will be guiding her along.

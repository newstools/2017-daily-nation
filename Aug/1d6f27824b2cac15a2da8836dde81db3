Retired Kenya international goalkeeper Mahmoud Abbas has described his predecessor Mahmoud Mohammed, who passed away on Monday night after a long battle with a heart and lung disease, as one of Kenya s best custodians. Abbas, who had been confused with the late goalkeeper due to the similarities in their names as well as their roles in the Kenya national team, said he was alive and well, and refereed to Mohammed as an idol whom he had looked up to throughout his teenage life. He was my idol. He was no doubt one of the best goalkeepers Kenya has ever produced. Definitely better than me. I grew up wanting to be like him, Abbas said. The moment I got a message that he had passed on is the exact moment my phone started ringing. More than 30 people have called me from all over the world, including Germany and Canada. They wanted to confirm if I am well because some reports indicated that it is me who had died but I kept assuring them that it isn t me who has died, but my idol, he said. Mohammed, 68, is reported to have died at around 7pm on Monday evening at his house in the presence of his son Ali Mahmoud. After Isha prayers my father requested for water, and to my surprise he closed his eyes afterwards. He was pronounced dead afterwards, Ali told Nation Sport.

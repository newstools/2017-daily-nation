Hi Brenda,I am 24 years old. I have been dating this lady for eight months now and we planned to get married but last month, we disagreed and had a very bad argument and she didn t attend my graduation. Instead, she went to see this guy and slept with him. Unfortunately she is now four weeks pregnant. She told me about it and I was heartbroken. She is an honest lady and I love her. The thing is, I really want to marry her but I don t trust her anymore and I don t know how to move on with this. What do I do?It's unfortunate that the woman you've been dating decided to react to a fight you had by sleeping with someone else.You say you love this woman and for this sole reason, you want to stay with her inspite of the betrayal. Now, I will tell you that love alone isn't a strong enough foundation for a relationship.Can you trust her again? There is also a child and possibly another man in the picture. The dynamics of this relationship have changed. Can you live with this new relationship?Just because you love someone doesn't mean that they're right for you. Don't be enslaved by love.Got a problem for Brenda? E-mail: [email&#160;protected] email print email print My husband of three years wants to marry his side-chick as his second wife.

I didn’t even know that this was a show, and now that I’ve found it, I’ve just discovered it was cancelled. Sigh. I guess DC’s first sitcom on NBC failed to pull ratings, which is interesting because I actually like the show, though to be fair, I’ve seen two episodes only, so perhaps I should hold my judgement. This show is about a girl who is hired by a research department in a superhero universe where superheroes ruin everything - in the process of saving the world, they leave another part of the world crumbling behind them. What do the civilians do when the heroes are done? That’s the premise of the show. Now to find where they hid the three unaired episodes...

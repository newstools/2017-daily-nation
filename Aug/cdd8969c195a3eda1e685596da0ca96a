Outgoing Tiaty MP Asman Kamama has said he will quit politics and focus on other things after he lost the parliamentary contest in the just concluded elections. He was defeated by a newcomer, Mr William Kamket of Kanu. FAREWELL In an interview with the Nation on Tuesday, Mr Kamama said he was exiting politics to concentrate on his businesses. “I wish Mr Kamket well in his leadership. I am exiting politics for good to join the business world and I do not want to interfere with Mr Kamket’s leadership. "My wish is they focus on education and the insecurity menace in the region,” Mr Kamama said. COMEBACK Mr Kamama was first elected to Parliament in 2002 on a Ford-People ticket. He was re-elected on PNU in 2007. In 2013, he joined URP and was once again re-elected. “I have been in politics for more than 15 years and it is now good that I focus on business but come 2022, Kamket’s team should expect stiff competition from someone in my team,” he added.

Local coffee chain Java House has continued its expansion outside Nairobi with its first restaurant in Machakos County. The company is investing Sh50 million to set up shop at Crystal Rivers Mall and Residences in Athi River. “We found Crystal Rivers to be a very strategic location for our new restaurant — ideally positioned between Nairobi and Machakos, along Mombasa Road and right next to a rapidly expanding residential and commercial area,” said Java House Group chief executive Ken Kuguru. The restaurant is set to open its doors by December, following its Eldoret and Kericho branches which are to open in September, as the company aims to set up a total of eight outlets by the end of this year. Java has been expanding outside Nairobi with branches in Nanyuki, Kisumu, Naivasha and Nakuru with more planned for Thika. The coffee chain has also indicated it will open more outlets in Nairobi estates.

Increased investment in new shops is a strategy that Java’s new owners have committed to keep pursuing, with plans to take the brand to new African countries in the medium-term. Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj Group recently fully acquired the coffee chain, buying stakes held by its founder Kevin Ashley and Washington-based Emerging Capital Partners in a multi-billion shilling transaction. Abraaj said Java would continue to benefit from the tailwind of Africa’s rapidly expanding middle class, sustained population growth and increasing urbanisation.

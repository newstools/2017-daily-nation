A head teacher and four employees facing a murder charge after a pupil was crushed to death by a school bus are yet to undergo a psychiatric examination before they take plea. Prosecuting counsel Ngina Mutua said she had been informed by the investigating officer that a doctor who was supposed to conduct the mental assessment was on leave. READ: School boss to get mental test in boy's death READ: Boy crushed to death by school bus Ms Sara Kesi, Mr Venant Mwaliko (bursar), Mr Valdi Mbadi (driver), Mr Abednego Fundi Mwendwa (mechanic) and Mr Charo Kazungu Charo (conductor) have been charged with the murder of six-year-old Jeremy Masila of St Augustineâ€™s Preparatory School. The boy, 6, was ran over by the back wheels of the bus when he fell down through an opening on the floor of the bus. OFFENCE The accused had previously been informed of the charge facing them but were not required to take plea since they had not undergone a mental test as required by law. The case, which was mentioned Monday before the High Court Deputy Registrar, has been fixed for mention on September 20. The offence was committed on July 21 at Sega within Mombasa County. RELEASE The court had also directed that the accused be released on a Sh1 million personal bond and report to the police every Monday until they take plea. The judge also directed the prosecution to supply the defence with all documents they intend to rely on. The accused, when they first appeared in court, said they intended to challenge their prosecution.

Five people have been arrested over unsealed ballot boxes in Nyando constituency, Kisumu County. Nyando Constituency Returning Officer Carol Okky said that out of the six ballot boxes only the presidential one was sealed. "The ballot box for woman representative, senator, governor, MP and MCA have been tampered with," Ms Okky said. They include a presiding officer and his deputy and a driver of the matatu used to ferry the ballot boxes. They were attached to Osaria Primary School in Kabonyo Kanyagwal Ward. Ms Okky said that the officials failed to scan and send the required forms to the Nyando Tally centre. "I have checked the online system seems the two did not sent form 34A," she said.

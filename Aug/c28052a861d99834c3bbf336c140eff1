IN LONDON Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto upheld Kenya’s dominance in the 3,000m steeplechase, handing the country its sixth consecutive World title at the London Olympic Stadium on Tuesday.American Evan Jager took over the lead at the 2,000m mark in 5:35.66 minutes with Kipruto, defending champion Ezekiel Kemboi and Moroccan Souffiane Elbakkali in hot pursuit.   Jager, the Olympic 3,000m silver medallist, hit the bell in the lead at 7:11.50 but Kipruto injected some pace to the race at the home straight. The Kenyan, who had won silver medals at the 2013 and 2015 World Championships, had the luxury of teasing the field and waving to the packed arena before winning in 8:14.12. Elbakkali went for silver in 8:14.49 as Jager claimed bronze in 8:15.53.     Kemboi, who was out to claim a record fifth title, finished 11th in 8:29.38. He retired from the track after the race.       It was Kipruto's second gold medal in just a year after his exploits at the Rio Olympic Games where he won in a Championship Record time of 8:03.28. It was also Kenya's 12th World steeplechases title in a dominance pioneered by Moses Kiptanui, who won the first title for Kenya at the1991 Tokyo Championships before strolling to a record hat trick in 1993 Stuttgart and 1995 Gothenburg. “Despite the ankle injury I sustained during the trials in June, I vowed not to let it go after Kemboi handed the baton to me at Rio Olympics,” said Kipruto. “The previous night, I was so worried about the injury and the challenge.”     Kipruto, 22, said he woke up in high spirits, telling himself that he had to do something good, him being the Olympic champion. “It was my duty to defend the title, uphold our tradition and I was ready to die for it,” Kipruto said. “I almost gave up with two laps to go after I felt some pain but something else told me to move on after Kemboi and Birech faded.”     Kipruto, who won the 2011 World Youth and 2012 World Junior titles in the steeplechase and ranks second on the all-time junior list with 8:01.16, said his next target is the World Record and Commonwealth Games title next year. “I want to finish off well at Brussels on September where I could attempt the World Record if the injury will have healed,” said Kipruto, who has a personal best of 8:00.12 minutes set at the Birmingham Diamond League event in 2016. Kenyan-born Saif Saaeed Shaheen of Qatar holds the World Record of 7:53.63 in Brussels.   Kemboi’s 11th place time was 8:29.38.

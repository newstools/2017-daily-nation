Are there more writer’s coming out of Nigeria simply because Kenyans, (and East Africa at large) is not nearly as invested in production of quality content? Whatever it is, there is a lot of good stuff coming out of Nigeria - from the old guard to the more modern contemporary writers such as this chapbook I found in my collection the other day. It was published by Saraba Magazine as part of their individual chapbook series in 2015. The editors at Saraba say that ‘that Velvet-Blue & Other Uncertainties is a tapestry of desire that is certain.’ They are not at all wrong. I was taken from the first line, onward to: I poured life into jars./Set them still by window sills./Bottled unbraided sunlight into rainbows/Against the darkness of forlorn dimensions. I will leave it there. You can get it at: http://sarabamag.com/download/velvet-blue-other-uncertainties-tunji-olalere/

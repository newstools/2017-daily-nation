NEW YORKThe NBA announced its full 1,230-game schedule for the upcoming season, complete with tweaks designed to reduce wear-and-tear on players through the grinding 26-week campaign.The 2017-18 season will be the first season in NBA history in which no team plays four games in five days. The number of back-to-back games has been reduced to 14.4 per team down from 16.3 last year.The issue of keeping teams fresh during a regular-season lasting more than six months gained urgency as coaches opted to rest stars like LeBron James and Stephen Curry occasionally to be sure they'd be ready for deep playoff runs.The absence of marquee players was felt not only by fans who paid for tickets but also by national broadcasters. ABC and ESPN recently paid $24 billion for the right to air some of the league's marquee games.To make it possible, the league shortened the pre-season, and added about a week to the regular season.The season that tips off on October 17 with the reigning champion Golden State Warriors taking on the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers, bested by the Warriors in last season's finals, taking on the Boston Celtics in a rematch of the Eastern Conference Finals.The NBA had already revealed its five Christmas Day contests, which include a Warriors-Cavaliers rematch.

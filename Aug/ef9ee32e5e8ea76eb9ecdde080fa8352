The will and courage was their but Kenyans once again failed to upstage Mo Farah as the Briton, powered by the packed Olympic Stadium, took to the front at the bell before easily winning a record third consecutive World 10,000m title on Friday. Even as World Cross Country champion Geoffrey Kamworor, Olympic 10,000m silver medallist Paul Tanui, World Half Marathon silver medallist Bedan Karoki of Kenya exchanged the leads alongside Ethiopian Jemal Yimer and Uganda’s Joshua Cheptegei, Farah calmly stayed behind the pack. Occasionally, Farah teased the crowd and his rivals with some tactical bursts before retreating only to go for it after the bell, winning in a world lead of 26 minutes and 49.51 seconds to add to his two Olympic titles. Tanui, who decided to take on Farah went out of the gas as Cheptegei glided past him to snatch silver in a personal best of 26:49.94. Tanui claimed his second World 10,000m bronze in a season best of 26:50.60. Karoki settled fourth, failing to win his maiden track medal in a personal best of 26:52.12 as Kamworor sunk to sixth in 26:57.77. As Farah became the first man to win three consecutive world titles, Kenya's drought continued as the country remained winless since since Charles Kamathi's victory in 2001 Edmonton. “We had planned to keep the pace high but still we failed to beat Farah who seems still to be in a class of his own,” said Karoki. “I had good endurance after participating in London Marathon in April.” Karoki now turns his focus on Fukuoka Marathon in December. “If I won’t win on track for sure my focus will be on marathon in 2019 Worlds and 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” said Karoki.   British athletics legend Mo Farah won his 10th successive global title on Friday.

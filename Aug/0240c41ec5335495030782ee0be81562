Politicians in Nakuru are yet to comply with an order by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to bring down billboards, posters and banners after the August 8 General Election. The electoral agency had last week Tuesday asked candidates in the just concluded polls to bring down posters and billboards within seven days. In a letter addressed to candidates, agents, political parties and party members, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said failing to remove such materials would attract fines and bans in future elections. The deadline elapses Monday.

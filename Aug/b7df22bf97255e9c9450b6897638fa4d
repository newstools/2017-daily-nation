Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro will be seeking to defend his seat when the second set of senators is sworn in, the Nation has learnt.An associate of the Speaker said that contrary to the notion that he had given up, Mr Ethuro is lobbying to retain the seat. In the history of Parliament, everybody has always defended their position until the voter makes their choice, said a senator who is acting as Mr Ethuro s pointman.Mr Ethuro is banking on his record as a safe pair of hands and his guidance of the affairs in a House that was constantly under threat and undermined by lawmakers in the National Assembly.Mr Ethuro s candidature intensifies the race as Charles Nyachae, who chaired the defunct Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution and lost in the Kisii senator elections, is reported to be a frontrunner.Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi told the Nation that he will be seeking to be elected as Deputy Speaker.CENTRAL PROVINCE I declared my interest in the position of Deputy Speaker by virtue of the fact that one, it was allocated to Central Kenya in the previous arrangement and it was held by Kembi Gitura. Out of all the senators from the former Central Province, I am the only one who returned to the House, said Mr Wamatangi.He also cites his experience in the House as well as the fact that he pushed and supported laws to support devolution. Mr Wamatangi s proposed law to manage the transition in the counties was not assented into law but part of his proposals were visible in the legal notice by the Devolution ministry establishing the transition committees.Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki is set to be retained as Majority Leader, with Kipchumba Murkomen of Elgeyo-Marakwet as deputy.With Beatrice Elachi no longer in the Senate, her position as Majority Whip is vacant.The different groupings have been holding meetings ahead of the first sitting of the House to gauge support and decide how to share out the positions. With the Jubilee Party having a majority in both Houses, it is in a position to decide how the major seats are to be shared.MINORITY POSITIONSThe final decisions will however be made at meetings of the parliamentary group, which are yet to be scheduled.In the National Super Alliance (Nasa), the legislators are lobbying for the positions of minority leader and minority whip as well as the leadership of the powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and Public Investments Committee (PIC).Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) of Raila Odinga has more elected MPs at 63 than its affiliates Wiper (17), Ford Kenya (11), and Amani National Congress which has 11. ODM therefore wants more powerful seats than other affiliate parties.The position of Minority Leader in the National Assembly will go to ODM, with Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and Suba MP John Mbadi being proposed to take up the slot. Mr Mbadi is currently among the most senior ODM MPs in the House as he is set to start his third term and is chairman of the party.Deputy minority leader position will go to Wiper with Benson Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) and Daniel Maanzo (Makueni MP) being touted to take up the position.PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEESources told Nation that Mr Mbadi is also being fronted to take up the leadership of the powerful Public Accounts Committee (PAC) but the Suba MP elect is said to have his eyes set on the minority leader seat previously held by Mr Francis Nyenze.It is reported that most MPs across the Nasa affiliate parties are displeased with Mr Nyenze s performance in the 11th Parliament and, therefore, will definitely be replaced.Amongst the ODM legislators, the dominant feeling is that they cannot this time be elbowed out of powerful positions on the basis that their Party Leader, Mr Odinga, is going to be the presidential candidate. They also cite the disappointment with Mr Nyenze and the defection of Mr Ababu Namwamba as proof that power should only be given to those whose loyalty is undoubted.ODM so far has three MPs from the Coast who have been proposed for the position of minority chief whip with either Aisha Jumwa, Mishi Mboko or Suleiman Dori (Msambweni MP elect) expected to be settled on. Deputy Chief Whip will be retained by Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa of Ford KenyaCOMMITTEESNambale MP John Bunyasi of ANC has been settled on by the opposition as the chairperson of the Public Investments Committee after the previous chairman Mr Adan Keynan shifted political allegiance to jubilee.While Homa Bay woman representative Ms Gladys Wanga still wants to retain her position as the representative of ODM in the Parliamentary Service Commission, her Busia counterpart Florence Mutua has also expressed interest in the commission. It is a tough balancing act for us as the positions available are few but there are many people who must be accommodated, said the source.Ugunja MP elect Opiyo Wandayi told Nation that they are still waiting for direction from their principals on how the positions would be shared without causing any friction within the coalition. We have not decided on anything yet as we are waiting for direction from our leaders, Mr Wandayi said. email print email print Jubilee wants to reward former CIC boss for loyalty and show appreciation for the Kisii votes.

The completion time for the second phase of the Standard Gauge Railway from Nairobi to Naivasha has been reduced to 36 months from the initial 54 months. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia said construction of SGR Phase 2A will resume after the National Environment Tribunal rules on a dispute challenging the project. The tribunal temporarily stopped the construction after activist Okiyah Omtatah and lobby group Kenya Coalition for Wildlife Conservation and Management filed an appeal against Kenya Railways and China Road and Bridges Corporation. The applicants sought orders stopping construction until the environmental and social impact assessments of the project are carried out. They said the project was commenced by tunnelling in Ngong Hills and approval of the route through Nairobi National Park and densely populated areas in Kajiado County without following the law. But CS Macharia on Friday exuded confidence that the tribunal will issue a favourable ruling and allow the project to proceed. “We have acquired land and upon disposal of that case the process will be fast tracked thereafter,” Mr Macharia said.

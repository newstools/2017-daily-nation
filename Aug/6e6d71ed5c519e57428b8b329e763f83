Operations at the Rift Valley Railways (RVR) remained grounded for the second day Friday as workers protested over payment of half salaries. The workers Friday protested at Nairobi’s RVR offices, saying  they will only resume work after they are paid their full  July salaries. The commuter train plying Ruiru, Kikuyu, Embakasi and Syokimau train was grounded Friday morning following the protest. The employees composed of drivers, train attendants, engineers, security personnel and welders  also blocked the train serving between the Nairobi’s city centre and Syokimau via Imara Daima. Rift  Valley Railways has said its unable to pay full salaries due to financial constraints that saw the government cancel concession agreement, which offered the rail firm rights to operate the Kenya-Uganda railway. “Concession was terminated. In the confusion, we lost a lot of business. The main issue however is how they  will access their internal provident fund, an issue which has been raised by their counterparts in Uganda,” said Sammy Gachuhi, RVR’s general manager, concessions and external communications.

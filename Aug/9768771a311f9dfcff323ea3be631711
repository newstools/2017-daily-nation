Maza, a new Swahili soap opera set in the coastal town of Mombasa premiered on Monday on Maisha Magic East. Maza is Swahili slang word for “mother” that illustrates negativity and lack of respect when used. No warm affection is attached to it and sounds unmotherly. The show depicts the unfolding intrigues and drama of a once successful family whose strong bond is crushed by a best friend’s envy in one night. Produced by TV couple, Lulu Hassan and her husband Rashid Abdala, it features five main characters Dingo (husband), Lea (Wife), Maya (Daughter), Badi (Son) and Kate (Lea’s best friend). Speaking to ActScene, Rashid Abdala said the show was to teach everyone about the culture, traditions and lifestyle of the coastal people. Asked how he came with the concept, he said the show is loosely based on the life of a popular woman back in his hometown of Kilifi. “My wife told me there was something about her which is mysterious,” Mr Abdala said. He called a script writer Ibrahim Chitai and they started working on the show. The show starts with a flashback when Lea mysteriously disappears and never to be found or heard from again. After years of an emotional roller-coaster, Dingo and his two kids Maya and Badi must find closure. The court declares Lea officially dead but her cousin sister Pili suspects malice and she is not ready to let go of this matter. When Lea’s best friend, Kate visits, she is warmly received and becomes the perfect replacement for Lea. Unbeknownst to the Dingo, the family lawyer, Wakili and his wife’s best friend Kate have eyed Lea’s wealth for years and this was their time to strike. When an opportunity presents itself, Kate wastes no time and manages to be Dingo’s new wife. But when she arrives at her new home, her true self reveals itself. She is a witch! Did she have a hand in the disappearance of her best friend? You have to watch to crack this case.

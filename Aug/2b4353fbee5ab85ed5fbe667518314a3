Friday will not be a national public holiday, acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has said. Dr Matiang’i, in a press statement on Wednesday, explained that Idd Ul Adha, which will be marked this Friday, is listed as a Muslim holiday and not a public holiday. BILL “The holiday is listed as Muslim holiday but plans are under way for the government to present a Bill in Parliament to make it a national public holiday,” the CS said. Dr Matiang’i, however, urged employers to allow their Muslim employees a day off to mark the annual holiday, also called the Sacrifice of the Feast. “Adherents of Islam religion will celebrate the day and therefore employers should allow them to be away from work. For non-Muslims this will be a normal working day,” said Matiang’i. Kenyans online had speculated that Friday would be a public holiday just like Idd Ul Fitr, another Islamic holiday.

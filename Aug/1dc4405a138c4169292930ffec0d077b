Former President Mwai Kibaki was among the last voters to cast their ballots as polling officially came to an end at 5pm. Mr Kibaki voted at Munaini Primary School polling station in Othaya, Nyeri County. The former head of State was accompanied by Nyeri County Commissioner Ngumo Kaluku, Land PS Nicholas Muraguri and county AP Commander Njue Njagi. The former president voted at around 5pm. Mr Kibaki was expected to cast his ballot at 11.30am. However, by 2.50pm, there were no signs that he would show up to vote. His name was not in the voters register pasted outside the polling station. ASSURANCE Two of his security men made four trips in and out of the polling station assuring journalists the former President was on his way. They at one point came back with an identification card and two voters cards believed to belong to Mr Kibaki. The returning officer at the station declined to speak to journalists and even barred them from taking pictures at the polling station. Munaini Primary School has been Kibaki’s polling centre for more than three decades. Earlier, Nyeri South Deputy County commissioner Stanley Kamande declined to comment on the confusion arising from the former President’s name missing in the voters’ list. “We are still expecting him to come vote, it is still early. We are working on the issue,” he said. The constituency returning officer Anncieta Musau said she was not aware the former President’s name was missing from the voters’ list. “The only way to confirm someone is on the list is by the voter coming to the polling station to vote. I am not aware of that situation,” she said. The former president left the polling station at 5.45pm.

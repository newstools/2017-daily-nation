Two people died in a road crash involving a tanker and a trailer truck at Kwa Muthike, Murang'a County, on Friday night. Makuyu OCPD Paul Wanjama said the gas tanker lost control and collided with the trailer that was heading to Nairobi, on Kambiti-Makutano road. Mr Wanjama said the two, the driver and the passenger in the tanker, died on the spot while several others were injured. "The [driver of the] gas tanker seemed to have been speeding when he lost control and caused the accident," Mr Wanjama said, adding that the bodies have been taken to a morgue in Thika. GAS LEAKAGEOn Saturday, the wreckages of the tanker and trailer caused a traffic snarl up forcing motorists to use alternative routes. Mr Wanjama said police vehicles were also forced to divert to avoid the scene of the accident since there was a gas leakage. "We had to avoid the route by all means to avert a fire due to gas leakage. "We had to cordon the area and asked the residents to avoid lighting any fire," the police boss said.

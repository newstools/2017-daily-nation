Suspected gangsters shot their colleague dead in Ruai after what witnesses termed as a disagreement. The three are suspected to have earlier shot and injured two people near a petrol station on Kangundo road on Tuesday afternoon. According to Kayole OCPD Joseph Gachangi, the three were on a drinking spree in the evening when the incident happened. “They were drinking at a local bar in Ruai when one of them ran outside after a disagreement with his colleagues. The others followed him and shot him dead before they left,” Mr Gachanga said. He said the gunmen were identified as the ones who had shot two people on Kangundo road as they ran away from police. “The three were on a motorcycle and when they saw police on patrol approaching, they started shooting at the police and in the process two civilians were injured,” said Mr Gachanga. Mr Gachanga said the injured are in stable condition after they were taken to Mama Lucy Hospital and that they are pursuing the gangsters.

A local betting firm will refund subscribers after calling off its election-related Sh19 million jackpot lottery as regulators declined to approve its premium mobile text service. Proponents of Uchaguzi Lotto said its premium USSD number *803# had been denied licence making it hard for Kenyans to place bets on Kenya’s next president. “We strived to overcome the challenges by involving the regulatory authorities but we have been unsuccessful in resolving the said challenges in good time to proceed with the lottery,” the firm said in a newspaper advert. It said mobile phone operators had accepted to participate in Uchaguzi Lotto where each bet was priced at Sh50 between July 21 and today, they were unable to proceed. Players were to dial the *803# and register for the bet, after which they would choose probable winners for presidential, gubernatorial, women representatives, MPs as well as senatorial race.

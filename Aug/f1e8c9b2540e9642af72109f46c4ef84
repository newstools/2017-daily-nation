IMPACTThe president and his deputy hold high regard for the county because it is where "Jubilee's roots can be traced". The county is considered a Jubilee stronghold hold despite being a cosmopolitan. The President will be seeking to stamp his authority in the region as well as emasculate any possible impact made by Nasa. WELCOMEThousands of supporters are expected to throng the venue is a show of solidarity. Ms Dorcas Gachira, a resident, welcomed Mr Kenyatta's visit, saying it is a special occasion. "We feel very happy that the president and his deputy have a high regard for this county and we are ready to welcome him back to his homeland," Ms Gachira said. VIOLENCEAmong the issues the residents expect the President to address, she said, is security - considering the county has been mapped out as a violence hotspot. Nakuru was also adversely affected by the 2007/8 post-election violence that say more than 1,000 people killed and others displaced. Hence, some residents are fleeing to their rural homes over violence fears. However, police have assured Kenyans of their safety.   In 2013, President Kenyatta garnered 109,000 votes in Narok against Mr Odinga 118,000.

Veteran actors of popular Kenyan TV show of the 90s, Vioja Mahakamani, have bashed the new cast that took up their roles. Vioja Mahakamani and Vitimbi had kept Kenyans entertained for two decades. With charismatic actors like Olexander Josephat (Peter Sankale) who started appearing in both shows in 1991, Mama Kayai (Mary Khavere), the late Mzee Ojwang Hatari (Benson  Wanjau), Ondiek Nyuka Kwota (Hirum Mungai), Gibson Kamau (Prosecutor), Mama G aka Judge (Lucy Wangui) and Alfonse Dot Makacha Dot Makokha (Mathias Keya), one was always assured of rib-cracking moments. However, things took a turn three years ago when the Vitimbi cast led by Mzee Ojwang, was asked to leave. In solidarity with their long-time colleagues , the cast of Vioja Mahakamani also decided to leave, according to Lucy. With the Vitimbi show dead, the management decided to revamp the popular court room drama show Vioja Mahakamani by roping in some new young faces that include comedian Dr Ofweneke, Nice Githinji, Maasai - among others. According to the veteran actors, the new cast simply can't match up to what they had created before. “It doesn’t surprise us that the new show does not have good ratings because what we had built in the show took us years. The new cast surely can’t match that simply because many people tuned in to watch us in Vioja Mahakamani," says Lucy Wangui. Since leaving Vioja , Olexander Josphat, Makoha and Ondiek having been appearing on Daktari, which is aired by KTN. More recently, Mama G, Prosecutor and Mama Kayai have teamed up in a new comedy Jungu Kuu that started airing last weekend on a local TV station.

Police in Tharaka-Nithi County are holding seven men accused of spreading leaflets containing intimidating message warning some unidentified persons from stepping into Ganga ward during election period. Maara police boss Johnston Kabusia said the main suspect was arrested by members of public at around 3am in Magutuni Market with some of the leaflets and taken to Magutuni police post and later transferred to Chogoria Police Station. Police said six other people were arrested for distributing the leaflets. “Once we are through with the investigations we will arraign them in court,” said Mr Kabusia. SECURITY The flyers seen by the Nation contained a message written in english and kiswahili were distributed in almost all markets and streets in Maara constituency on Sunday night. “We have copies of the leaflets and we will make sure we know the source and the real intention of the message just a day to polling exercise,” said the police boss. The officer assured members of the public security and warned that anyone trying to disrupt peace during and after the polls will be dealt with. He said police have been deployed in most parts of the constituency and the team is expecting to receive some reinforcement from the General Service Unit. “The GSU officers will be deployed in violence hotspots like Magutuni and Marima markets,” he said.

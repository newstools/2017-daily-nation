Americans Emma Coburn and Courtney Frerichs produced the shock of the World Championships when they swept to a 1-2 victory in women’s 3,000m steeplechase dealing Kenya’s quartet a major blow on Friday. The Kenyans, led by the World champion Hyvin Kiyeng, seemed to have concentrated on battering Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion Kenyan-born Ruth Jebet of Bahrain who went out of gas with 300m to go. Kiyeng powered to the lead but Coburn and Frerichs pursued her with zeal, beating the Kenyan, who is also the Olympic 3,000m steeplechase silver medallist at the last water barrier. Coburn, the Rio Olympic 3,000m steeplechase bronze medallist, burnt all the gas in her cylinder on the home straight for gold in a Championship Record time of 9:02.58, beating her colleague Frerichs to second in a personal best of 9:03.77. Kiyeng’s efforts for silver fell short to only settle for bronze in 9:04.03 followed by Beatrice Chepkoech, who lost track at the water barrier before going back with six laps to go, in 9:10.45. Jebet, the World Record holder, came in fifth in 9:13.96 and World Under-20 champion Cellphine Chespol came in sixth, improving her World Under-20 record to 9:15.04. Commonwealth champion Purity Kirui settled 10th in 9:25.62. “I tried my best to kick after the water barrier but my body failed to respond. The American was far much ahead,” said a disappointed Kiyeng. “I am happy with the bronze and I should turn my focus on the last race in the Diamond League in Brussels.” The crest-fallen Chepkoech, Chespoel and Kirui failed to take interviews perhaps reeling from the shocking performance.   The final is due on the last day of the championships on Sunday.

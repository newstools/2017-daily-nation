A policeman who allegedly shot and killed a politician after he reportedly turned down his request to take beer on his tab at a club in Limuru Town will be detained for seven days to allow for further investigations. Kiambu Principal Magistrate Justus Kituku on Monday granted detectives an application to continue holding police Constable Edward Manjalu at the Tigoni police station as they continue with investigations. BARThe officer is said to have killed Mr William Mwangi, an engineer who unsuccessfully vied for the Lari Kirenga ward representative seat in the August 8 elections. The 3am Sunday incident was linked to a confrontation at U-Turn bar, where Mr Mwangi is said to have refused to buy the officer beer. Mr Manjalu was attached to the Flying Squad unit at the Tigoni police station before he was recently transferred to the Directorate of Criminal Investigation headquarters in Nairobi. PAY FIRSTThe magistrate directed that the officer, who was arrested on Sunday morning, be produced in court on Monday next week when he is expected to take a plea. During the incident, according to the bar’s management, Mr Mwangi was with his friends when the officer took a bottle of beer bought by the group without their consent. Consequently, Mr Mwangi and his friends told the officer that he could only have it if he was ready to pay. SHOTAccording witnesses, a confrontation ensued, escalating to a fist fight that left the officer with injuries on his face. Mr George Karuga, the bar manager, said the pub’s security team threw the officer out to restore calm. However, when Mr Mwangi was leaving, he was confronted by Mr Manjalu, who was with unknown people. When Mr Mwangi got into his car the officer shot him twice.   The bar manager said the officer was thrown out to restore calm.

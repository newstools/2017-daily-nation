There was a hitch in the distribution of ballot materials in Samburu County following heavy downpour on Monday evening. Several polling stations in Samburu East, West and North constituencies were affected as a result of the heavy downpour that left roads impassable. A number of bridges were swept away while vehicles ferrying polling materials got stuck in mud forcing Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission officials to intervene by sending rescue vehicles. Private and commercial car owners took advantage of the situation by hiring their vehicles to IEBC at the rate of Sh. 5,000 to Sh. 20,000 depending on the distance to transport ballot materials to and from the voting stations. Distribution of materials which was scheduled to start at 2pm on Monday was delayed for several hours. Some materials left Maralal town, the county's headquarters of Samburu at around 10pm. Polling clerks and officers had to be accompanied by two security officers to their various polling stations across the county. Several stations in Maralal town began setting up the voting area a few minutes past Monday midnight (Tuesday dawn). 120 security officers comprising the Kenya Police, Administration Police, Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Prisons manned the county's three tallying centres.

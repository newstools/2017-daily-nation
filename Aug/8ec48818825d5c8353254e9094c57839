An umbrella body of waste collectors in the country has called on the Nairobi governor to promptly address the issues that have made waste management in the city an uphill task. Addressing the media on Friday outside City Hall, Waste and Environment Management Association of Kenya (Wemak) chairman Chege Kariuki presented a raft of issues: zoning tenders, sorting stations, high licensing costs, poor access roads and polythene bags ban. They believe that if the issues are addressed, Nairobi would be rescued from the mountains of filth it is currently grappling with. MONOPOLYOn zoning and franchising of garbage collection, the association urged Governor Mike Sonko to rein in garbage collection cartels, who have monopolised the industry, by enforcing laws that promote fairness. "We implore you to allow free and fair competition in the waste management industry, which is possible through non-biased enforcement of the laws as pertains this industry," Mr Kariuki said. He pointed out that monopoly is what caused the previous administration's poor performance. "Please see the effect of a monopolized approach from what has happened to our CBD and other areas. "Increased poor performance became the fruit of monopoly," he said.

Mr Kariuki also urged Mr Sonko to scrap unnecessary licences such as road licence fees, tipping fees, and payment for security at Dandora dumpsite, among others, charged on private garbage operators. "We currently pay authority licence fee at Sh20,000 per vehicle per year, tipping fees charged at Sh1,000 per truck on every trip to Dandora dump site, Nema licence at Sh5,000 shillings annually....and these costs are a major burden," he added. More importantly, he said they ready to work with Mr Sonko.

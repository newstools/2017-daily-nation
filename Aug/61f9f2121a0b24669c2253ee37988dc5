Deejay Xclusive, real name Joram Baraka Ndege, has been on a weight loss journey and since March he has lost 22 kilogrammes. Xclusive told Showbuzz that this was his new year s resolution but it officially started in March. I d started back in February but I got sick and took time out to recover. So since March I ve been hard at work shedding off the extra weight, the deejay said, adding that he is on a mission that goes by the funny hash tag Return of the Neck and Sex Symbol Manenoz. When its hard finding clothes that fit you or when you have to punch extra holes in your belt then you know there s a problem. I once bought a shirt and I couldn t button it at the neck. Initially there were people who thought I couldn t do it but my friends and family have been very supportive. I ve also inspired people to start working out, he said.He works out five times a week and before hitting the gym. He also runs five kilometres. I don t diet, I ve just reduced my food portions. Before I used to eat six slices of bread, one avocado and three eggs. Now I only take two slices of bread, one egg and tea for breakfast. I ve also cut down on my consumption of alcohol. You know usually, after a gig deejays just pop into a pizza joint and that s where trouble starts... Xclusive says even though he was heavier before, he did not have self-esteem or confidence issues. I used to call myself Fatty or Kanono , confidence has never been an issue. However the term sex symbol for me, means being who you say you are, he said. email print email print

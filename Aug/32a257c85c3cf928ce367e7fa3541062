A mother and her two daughters were burnt to death in their house in Dandora Phase 3 early Wednesday morning. Police officers from Buruburu Police Station received a distress call at night and found that the three had been burnt beyond recognition while they were asleep. IDENTITIES Nairobi County Police Commander Japhet Koome said the family’s house was one of the 10 that caught fire under unclear circumstances. “The remains were taken to the City Mortuary and we are yet to know what really caused the fire,” Mr Koome said. He said the identities of the three had been established but police were trying to trace their kin to inform them about the incident. “We have establish from the neigbours and relatives that they were a mother and her two children and not a couple and a child as it was earlier reported,” Mr Koome said.

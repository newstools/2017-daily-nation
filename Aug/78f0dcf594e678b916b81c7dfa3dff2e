LONDON Justin Gatlin shrugged off the boos to stun Usain Bolt in the 100m final at the world championships on Saturday. Here's how Twitter reacted: "FINAL INSULT...WHAT A DOPE." Mail on Sunday tweet their sports front page, condemning Gatlin who has served two doping bans. "Leaves a sour taste in the mouth but #Bolt won't be remembered for tonight. Total game changer. #legend." Former England football star Michael Owen @themichaelowen "No one saw that happening no one wanted that to happen #Gatlin." British athlete Kelly Sotherton @KellySotherton "Imagine becoming world champion only to have the fans boo you and chant the name of the guy in 3rd place. London fans are savage." Ex-400m runner Dai Greene @DaiGreene "The cheat!!!! Nooooooooo....." Former Ireland rugby skipper Brian O'Driscoll @BrianODriscoll "I was so excited for this race and as a sports fan I feel robbed. Couldnt have been a worse result. Can deal with Bolt losing but not to a cheat #thedarksideofsport." Retired British swimmer Karen Pickering, now a TV commentator @Karen_Pickering "Didn't agree with booing of @justingatlin at #IAAFWorlds but no denying this result is disaster for sport." Veteran athletics correspondent Duncan Mackay @Duncan_ITG "Over an hour after the 100m, Usain Bolt is still responding to fans and their chants of "Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt" before doing more media." Athletics Weekly @AthleticsWeekly "What a moment to be there live for @usainbolt's last 100m race. A great man on and off the track, who has inspired many. What a legend!" British heavyweight boxer David Haye @mrdavidhaye

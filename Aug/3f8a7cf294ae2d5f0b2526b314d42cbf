Reports indicate that there is no sign of a police raid at the Nasa tallying centre at Sifa Towers in Nairobi, contrary to earlier reports. The Nation journalist at the building said: "Nothing is happening and the guards say they have seen nothing." But Nasa co-principal Musalia Mudavadi said hooded men raided their offices in Westlands. He claimed the attackers ransacked the office, harassed its staff who were in and took desktop computers, laptops and destroyed their servers and alarm. “They roughed up watchmen, harassed people in the office, demanding IDs and date of birth,” he said. Earlier, Mr Paul Mwangi, who is the head of Raila Odinga's presidential legal team, had said that a raid was ongoing; a claim also backed by Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and Norman Magaya, the Nasa chief executive officer. Additionally, Mr Dennis Onyango, Mr Odinga's spokesman, later issued a statement saying: "A few minutes to 8pm Friday, police in hoods and armed with AK47 and machine guns raided different offices that host operations of the Opposition National Super Alliance and held staff, mostly young university and college students on internship, hostage, forcing them to lie on the floor for hours then took away all their equipment. "...The raiders also broke down and ferried away surveillance cameras, desktop computers, computer servers, Ipads and laptops in addition to taking photos of the identification documents of all the staff." Police are yet to respond to the matter.

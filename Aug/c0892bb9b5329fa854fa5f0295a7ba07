The most difficult word in the National Assembly on Thursday morning was "conscientiously". MPs taking the oath of office found it hard to pronounce the word, forcing some to resort to the easier "conscious." AD-LIBBING The swearing-in started shortly after the MPs were welcomed and taken through the first sitting presided over by the Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai. The oath was in English and Kiswahili and those electing to take it in English had to encounter the troublesome word. Some MPs were caught ad-libbing. Kiambu Town MP Jude Njomo added the words Jude Njomo, "a servant of the people of Kiambu" in the oath and was forced to stop and start afresh. Joshua Kuttuny, who made it back for a second term after five years in the cold, added "na watu wa Cherangany" and was asked to repeat it. Embakasi East MP Babu Owino added the name “Raila Odinga” and, on retaking, “Tibim”. COLOUR After Changamwe MP Omar Mwinyi also made a change, Mr Sialai asked him to repeat it. "I'm asking the members to take the oath as set out in the Constitution," said Mr Sialai. Among the more colourful MPs was Turkana Central lawmaker John Lodepe, who was in an orange suit. Mr Lodepe defected to ODM from Jubilee and retained his seat. Makueni Woman Rep Rose Museo was the first MP to take the oath. She was given priority as a disabled person and was followed by Kajiado Woman Rep Janet Teiyaa and then Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi.

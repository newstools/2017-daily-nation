Hundreds of Budalang'i residents have taken to the streets to celebrate President Uhuru Kenyatta’s win in the just-concluded general elections. Mr Kenyatta was on Friday night declared the winner of the fiercely contested August polls after over three days of claims of irregularities from the opposition Nasa principals led by their presidential candidate Raila Odinga. The President-elect garnered 8,203,290 votes reflecting 54.2 per cent of the votes cast with Mr Odinga coming in second with 6,762,224 reflecting 44.7 per cent of total votes. Led by Labour Party leader Ababu Namwamba, the residents chanted “Haki yetu, Haki yetu....Uhuru tano tena, Uhuru tano tena.” WILL OF KENYANS Addressing supporters in Port Victoria Town, Mr Namwamba urged the opposition led by Mr Odinga to concede defeat and respect the will of Kenyans “that had prevailed in broad daylight”. He added that as Labour Party, they are contented with the outcome of the elections which he termed was peaceful, free, fair and credible as confirmed by accredited observers from across the world. “We are happy to have been part of a well-run presidential campaign that swept across the country including perceived opposition strongholds of Kisii, Coast, Nyamira and some pockets of Western Kenya. MBELE IKO SAWA “We don’t regret our association with Jubilee and we are happy that an initiative such as ‘Mbele iko sawa’ which was under my stewardship yielded overwhelming results in determination of the polls outcome,” said Mr Namwamba. The two-term Budalang'i MP was beaten at the ballot by his long-time nemesis Raphael Wanjala who garnered 13,393 votes compared to the 11,200 votes which he got. Mr Namwamba has since disputed the results. The former ODM secretary-general had vowed to ensure that he delivers enough votes to the UhuRuto team after differing with Mr Odinga, leading to his exit from ODM.

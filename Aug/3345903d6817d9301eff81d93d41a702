Voting was delayed in two constituencies in different counties over ballot mix-up. Nairobi Road Primary School polling station in Nakuru East constituency received MCA ballot papers belonging to Kirinyaga County Ndia constituency. The mix-up affected 700 voters in one stream in Nakuru. In Kirinyaga, the mix-up affected Thumaita polling centre in Ndia constituency. Polling officers in the two polling stations borrowed some of the missing ballot material from other streams allowing the exercise to continue as they waited for delivery of the right material. Nakuru Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Returning Officer Silas Rotich said the matter was being addressed. Mr Rotich said they realised there was a mix-up when the process had already started. "We have been forced to borrow the missing material from the other streams as we await delivery of the correct material,‚Äù Said Mr Rotich. A helicopter carrying the right material landed at Nakuru High School at 1.20pm According to the officer, the delay was as a result of lack of pilots to airlift the voting materials from Kirinyaga to Nakuru. Some of the voters said that they had arrived at the polling centre as early as 3am in the morning. Reports by Magdalene Wanja, Francis Mureithi and Nicholas Komu.   Voting started at 6am in most polling stations.

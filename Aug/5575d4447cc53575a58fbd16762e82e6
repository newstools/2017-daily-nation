The Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM), the professional body for HR practitioners in Kenya, celebrated their 30th anniversary by organising a two-day career fair at the University of Nairobi on July 26 and 27 this year. The much-anticipated fair was sponsored by yours truly, myNetwork, among other partners. The students got to engage with HR practitioners on a one-on-one basis, had their CVs reviewed and given advice on how to present themselves at interviews. According to Irene Kimacia, Head of Corporate Communications at IHRM, most of the resumes they perused were not updated and contained a lot of unnecessary information. “When a particular job is advertised, HR managers get hundreds of applications, so they have no time to go through them all. To make it easy for them, be concise and only list what is relevant to the job that you are applying for. Unless the job description is intended for a particular group of people, there is no point of indicating your gender, age or religion in your curriculum vitae.” The Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM), the professional body for HR practitioners in Kenya, recently organised a two-day career fair at the University of Nairobi.

Hello, I am 24. I have been dating this man for a number of years. He is a good man with a great personality. Recently, he has been insisting that we get married. I would want to marry him someday but I am not ready now. The other problem is that he is overweight and I am ashamed of being seen with him. He, on the other hand, seems okay with it. Should I get married to him or just forget about marriage for now? The right time for a woman to get married is when she wants to and when she feels she is ready to. So if you are not ready, stick to your guns. No one should rush you into marriage. For the weight problem, it is important that you are physically attracted to the person you marry. Does your boyfriend’s weight kill this attraction? If it does, talk to him about it and see if you can come to a middle ground. You also seem overly concerned with what others think of your boyfriend. If you love him, if he makes you happy, if you are physically attracted to him, then all else shouldn’t matter. If you are talking about weight, then the conversation should be about his health.  Got a problem?

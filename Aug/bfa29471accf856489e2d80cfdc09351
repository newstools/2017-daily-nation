Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has picked Kenya and Nigeria as the next beneficiaries of a global training programme for school-children looking to pursue a career in engineering. The interactive programme, dubbed Airbus Little Engineer (ALE), is dedicated to educating and helping students aged between 10 and 16 understand and appreciate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Airbus is targeting to impact about 3,000 students in the two countries. The Kenyan chapter will be run in collaboration with Travelling Telescope, a company that educates children across the country about astronomy through school visits and public events. “Africa has developed an innovation culture that is growing fast with many social entrepreneurs. We want to support and work with them,” said Andrea Debbane, the executive director of Airbus Foundation, the programme’s backers. “It is important that we all join efforts to facilitate the access to STEM skills. These skills play a key role because STEM-related jobs are at the core of solving the complex problems of today’s world.” and its future.” READ: Six Kenyan engineering innovations in top contention for Africa prize

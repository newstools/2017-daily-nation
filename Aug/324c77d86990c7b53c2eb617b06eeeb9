Students in public universities are set to stay at home for another week after the Ministry of Education ordered a postponement of the re-opening day. This is the third time that the re-opening dates have been changed, a move that is likely to affect students who had hoped to complete their programmes on time. ORIENTATIONTechnical University of Kenya (TUK) has now set its re-opening to September 11, University of Nairobi will re-open on September 4 and Rongo University on September 7. TUK vice-chancellor Francis Aduol said First Year students will report to campus on September 7 to start their orientation, which will run up to September 9. “Registration for first year students will be ongoing up to and including September 1,” Prof Aduol said in a statement. ELECTIONSHe went on: “All members of staff are notified that normal university operations will continue on Monday, August 28.” Universities closed early this month in order to allow students and staff to participate in the August 8 polls and most of them had scheduled re-opening on August 18. However, the Ministry of Education pushed this to August 21 and later to August 28. The postponement is likely to affect academic programmes in a year that also bore the brunt of two strikes by lecturers in March and July.

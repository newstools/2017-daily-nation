Zoo Kericho s promotion to the 2017 SportPesa Premier League sparked wild celebrations amongst the club faithful following years of near misses and heartbreak in the second tier.But barely a month into the new season, the team has found the going tough having lost their opening four matches and are still after their first goal.Zoo were welcomed to the top flight with a 1-0 loss to Posta Rangers, suffered a similar margin loss to Gor Mahia before going down 2-0 to newbies Nakumatt FC in their third encounter. Thika United also claimed a 1-0 win over Sammy Okoth s charges last Sunday.Long serving team manager Ibrahim Muganda has attributed the team s slow start to life in the top tier to financial instability and bad luck but remained optimistic they still have high chances of turning their fortunes. We are yet to receive our monthly grants from KPL and that has forced us to operate the second tier way. Players are not feeling the difference of playing in the top flight and second tier, Muganda said. We are however playing well but luck has not been on our side. We have played against top teams but only conceded one goal, which shows we are doing well. For head coach Sammy Okoth, his inexperienced players are still learning the ropes. We have a number of players who are playing in the top tier for the first time and adjusting has been a challenge, Okoth said. We have been committing costly mistakes in the matches we have played but I am sure once we get back on track we shall be able to stay in the premier league, added the former Kenyan international striker, who has formerly handled the now defunct Finlays Horticulture and Ushuru FC.Striker Nicholas Kipkirui, 20, who took the National Super League by storm the last two years, has promised to hit his 10-goal target despite the odds. The Premier League is a bit different to the NSL but we are in for it. We are learning and soon luck will be on our side, the Harambee Stars triallist added. email print email print

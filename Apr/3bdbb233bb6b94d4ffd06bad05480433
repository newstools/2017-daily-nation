During that while, he turned out for Finland s top flight clubs Liiga Ploki and Oriveden Ponnistus, and then, recently, Azerbaijan top club Azerrail Baku. I am excited to be back and happy that my teammates have welcomed me back in a warm manner. I can see that competition is tight here but the important thing is to join forces and ensure we win the league this season, said Moim.Moim, 28, did not play any part in the recently-concluded Women s Africa Club Championship in Tunisia where Prisons finished third owing to late registration, but Kenya Volleyball Federation organizing secretary Ishmael Chege has since processed her clearance to compete locally. She has already infused morale into her teammates, and her experience is invaluable. We now have a full strength squad with makes our target of dominating Pipeline over the season more realistic, said Lung aho.Prisons and Pipeline will be meeting for the second time in as many weeks.

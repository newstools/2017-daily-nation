The release of a million bags of maize from the strategic grain reserve and the sanctioning of imports are two significant responses to a potentially devastating crisis. Maize flour is so central in the lives of a majority of Kenyans precisely because lack of ugali in their diets is akin to hunger and starvation. Indeed, a maize shortage has pushed up the price of a two-kilogramme packet of maize flour to an all-time high price of Sh153 from Sh130 only three weeks ago. With the release of the maize from the reserve, the government now expects the price to drop to Sh115, which would be a bit more manageable. And once the imports land, the availability of more of the staple food should force the prices even lower. However, the biggest worry now is whether the supply of maize can be sustained. Reaching into the strategic reserve is a pointer that the situation is dire, but with the concern about the apparent failure of the long rains, the authorities must worry about the need to replenish those stocks as it is unlikely that the harvests later in the year will be good. The importers have a four-month window, but the problem here is often the wheeler dealers keen to exploit the situation for their personal gain. Every effort must be made to ensure that the people have enough food and that it is affordable by keeping an eye on those out to profit from the misery of others.

Three Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) MPs in Kakamega County have been rejected by their respective constituents in party nomination exercise. The MPs Andrew Toboso (Butere), Silverse Anami (Shinyalu) and Raphael Otaalo of Lurambi have however vowed to appeal the Saturday nominations outcome. The MPs complained that the primaries were poorly organised citing delays in delivery of election materials in their constituencies. Mr Anami accused Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya of interfering with the primaries, claiming the delay in delivery of ballots to polling stations in his stronghold was a deliberate scheme to disadvantage him against his competitor Mr Justus Kizito Mugali. On his part, Mr Otaalo said voters in his strongholds were locked out of the primaries after the ballot papers arrived in polling stations late. But Mr Oparanya has denied the accusations saying he did not influence the party nominations. In Butere constituency, Mr Toboso who is the ODM County Secretary was beaten by Marama West ward representative Habil Nanjendo Bushuru. Mr Bushuru garnered 10,378 votes while Mr Toboso got 8448 votes in the contest for the ODM ticket. Mr Otaalo lost to Stanley Khainga in Lurambi constituency. Prof Khainga got 11645 votes against Mr Otaaloâ€™s 3518 votes. In Shinyalu, Mr Mugali won the nominations after garnering 3460 votes while Mr Anami got 1522. Khwisero MP Benjamin Andola got 6154 votes beating his rival Benjamin Anadama who got 3,995 votes while the outgoing Kakamega County Woman Representive Ms Rachael Ameso came third with 2,346 votes. Ms Ameso has vowed to lodge an appeal to overturn the results over alleged irregularities in the nominations.

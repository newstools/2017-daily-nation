Former Lawyer Society of Kenya boss Apollo Mboya has sued the State, arguing that a website touting the government's achievements violates the Elections Offences Act. Mr Mboya has sued the Attorney-General and wants the government to be temporarily barred from advertising its achievements for the past four years on the website, also referred to as a government portal, www.delivery.go.ke, which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on April 10. Mr Mboya argues that Section 14 of the Election Act bars the government from proclaiming its achievements during the election period and using public resources to do so. The said law was published in the Kenya Gazette on March 17 by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). He says the Jubilee administration is trumpeting its achievements in the wrong period and that information posted on the website is allegedly misleading. He points out that questions have been raised by Kenyans on Twitter about the achievements posted on the portal. He argues that the advertising puts the government on the spot over the integrity of the achievements and that the continuous advertising poses a threat to free and fair elections. He also faults the IEBC and the Director of Public Prosecutions, saying they have failed to initiate investigations into that election offence, which may undermine the August 8 polls.

I think based on the number of chances we created in the match, we deserved to win, and credit to the team because they wanted it more and eventually we got the one goal. We, however, need to be clinical in our finishing in future matches, the tactician said in his post-match comments. His Nakumatt counterpart Anthony Mwangi was at pains to explain his team s dismal display. It is difficult to talk about the match but plainly we have got to do better than this if we want to stay in the top-flight, he said.Sharks were the better of the sides in the first half keeping possession brilliantly.Sharks Duke Abuya went close in the 24th minute but his rasping shot hit the woodwork after a lovely lay-off by Matthew Odongo.The introduction of former Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards player Timonah Wanyonyi for Joshua Oyoo saw Nakumatt enjoy their best spell of the match as they searched for the equalizer.Wanyonyi almost set up the leveller in the 72nd minute after exchanging some neat passes with teammate Kepha Aswani. email print email print

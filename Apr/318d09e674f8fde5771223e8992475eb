Chaos rocked City Hall on Friday morning as county executives and county assembly members fought over office space. The two sides clashed over the ownership of offices located on the fourth floor of the Northern Wing of City Hall. BARRIER This was after the county assembly allegedly erected a wall to block workers from Governor Evan Kidero’s office from accessing the disputed space. County Secretary Robert Ayisi on Friday said the barrier was put up last year after the House laid claim to the office.   The disputed office block houses the county’s Valuation Department. “The office houses over 600 files, which the executives rely on to carry out their day-to-day business,” Dr Ayisi told the Nation. POLICE He pointed an accusing finger at a top county assembly official, who he claimed has been working to frustrate the county executive. The executive had taken control of the contested space and workers were tearing down the wall by the time we went to press.   Police were called in to restore order and the officers were guarding the premises as the work went on. This is the second time the county executive and the legislature are clashing over office space at the county headquarters. SUPREMACY On November 29, 2016, a sergeant-at-arms drew his gun and threatened to shoot Kenya County Government Workers Union members who were fighting members of the county assembly for office space.   The fight broke out when the workers decided to bring down a wall put up to deny county staff access to offices claimed by MCAs. For months now, members of the county assembly and the executive staff have been fighting over office space in what seems to be a supremacy battle pitting the county executive against the legislature.

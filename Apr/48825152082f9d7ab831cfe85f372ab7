Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has maintained that his administration has done plenty in terms of development, chiding his critics for only being focused on preventing his re-election. Dr Kidero said he has a clear agenda on how the county will progress and he is not engaging in empty promises that are being peddled by Jubilee Party leadership. "My main agenda for Nairobi is service to Nairobians and nothing else. We have a good plan that will take this city forward," he said at SDA Railways Church. Governor Kidero said since taking over, he had managed to procure more lorries for garbage collection, which are collecting 2,000 tonnes per day, an increase from 300 tonnes. He urged the congregation to vote for him again so that he can complete pending projects and initiate more. The county boss further rebuked leaders fanning violence. "We must reject leaders who believe in violence. We want to have a peaceful county." Some of those seeking the top position are Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and former presidential contester Peter Kenneth, both in Jubilee. Mr Kenneth has in more than one occasion said the incumbent has failed to competently address problems such as garbage collection.

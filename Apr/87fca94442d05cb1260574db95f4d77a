Midfielder Fredrick Shimonyo however restored parity with yet another penalty in the 67th minute. Shimonyo delivered the winning goal in the 80th minute from a corner kick to hand the Henry Omino coached side an exhilarating win. We performed badly against Sofapaka and but I must admit the match was an eye opener since it helped us address our weakness. Our opponents were better than us but we utilized well our chances to get the results we wanted. This win is a motivation to my players and we are keen to keep on improving in our next matches, Omino said after the match.Keen on making amends to their first loss of the season, Stima kicked the match off on the right foot and within the first five minutes, they had already earned two corners that failed to rattle the Gor Mahia s defence.With a solid defence anchored on centre backs Jackson Saleh and Vitalis Akumu, striking pair of Tuyisenge and Timothy Otieno found it tough to penetrate in the first ten minutes despite numerous attempts.However, the dynamics of the match changed in the 16th minute when Gor Mahia were awarded a controversial penalty after skipper Saleh was adjudged to have fouled Tuyisenge in the box though it was 50-50 challenge ahead of the collision.Tuyisenge took the resultant spot kick sending Western Stima number two Stephen Odhiambo the wrong side for Gor s fifth goal of the season.The goal fired up Kogalo s hunger upfront and would have doubled their lead had Timothy Otieno aimed well at the target from Karim Nizigiyimana s cross from the right.Tuyisenge also had two chances to stretch the lead before the break but all failed to hit the target.On resumption, Western Stima coach summoned Hubert Kopany and Moses Arita for Benard Ondiek and Wesley Kemboi, while Meddie Kagere replaced Otieno on the other end.The changes paid dividends for the home side when Kopany was fouled in the box with centre referee pointing to the spot.Shimonyo converted the spot kick to silence Gor Mahia fans after sending Boniface Oluoch the wrong side.Gor Mahia tactician Marcelo Ferreira then summoned George Odhiambo for the tired Ernest Wendo in the 77th minute in search of a winning goal. However, it is Stima that had the last laugh as Shimonyo once more stabbed in the winner with ten minutes left to put the match beyond doubt.Reports by Gaitano Pesa, Celestine Olilo and Francis MureithiWEEKEND RESULTSMathare United 1-2 SofapakaSoNy Sugar 1-0 Thika UnitedTusker 1-0 Chemelil SugarWestern Stima 2-1 Gor MahiaZoo 0-2 NakumattKariobangi Sharks 0-1 Ulinzi Stars Bandari 3-0 Muhoroni YouthKakamega Homeboyz 1-1 Posta Rangers AFC Leopards 2-1 Nzoia Sugar email print email print Inflation rises to its highest since May 2012 as prices rise week by weekODM leader tells Jubilee to leave Joho alone and pledges to ensure all votes are counted in

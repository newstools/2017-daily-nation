We must continue dominating in each and every game and I am looking forward to the next round of matches in Eldoret." explained Lung'aho.Lung'aho's side have failed to win the national league and continental title for the past three years, a factor Lung'aho seemed to have been referring to in his statement.Meanwhile, Kenya Prisons' men team defeated Kenya Defence Forces 3-0 (25-19,25-22,25-17) to win the men's title.Enroute to the finale, the Wardens overcame a shaky start in the opening set to eventually hammer their Mombasa based counterparts 3-0(30-28, 25-18 and 25-21).KDF on their part, saw off hosts Nairobi Water 3-1 (18-25, 25-20, 25-19 and 25-22).In the women's matches, Prisons sailed through to the final following a 3-1(24-26, 25-16, 25-16, 25-17) win over Kenya Pipeline "A" whilst KCB also triumphed over Kenya Pipeline "B" with similar set scores of 25-13, 29-27, 18-25, 25-19)."It was difficult to watch over my two teams in the semi-finals considering both games were played at the same time. But generally, I am concerned with the two defeats we suffered to Prisons in this competition, I hope to bounce back in Eldoret." Pipeline coach Japheth Munala offered.Both the men and women winning teams were each awarded Sh100,000 as prize money. email print email print

You might own all the best make-up brands in the world, but they will look uneven and blotchy if you apply them wrong. Part of the skill of flawless make-up application lies in the tools you use. The correct tools might even make your convenience store brands look up-market on your skin. These tools evolve almost every day, so make sure you are up to date with the latest for the most flawless application. Silisponge: Made of transparent silicone, this sponge is the latest in use for applying foundation perfectly and economically. It saves you product because it does not absorb it, and it does not remain on the sponge. It all slides onto your skin in a few swift moves. Multi-use brush: This brush will do everything from blending your eye shadow to slicking on under-brow concealer. It also helps you get into every corner and crevice of your face. Beauty blenders: These work to smooth in thick formulas of concealers and contouring products. Select those with small pores to minimise product absorption. Eyebrow stencils: With all the emphasis to achieve perfectly symmetrical brows, this tool creates made-to-measure brows. Finishing brushes: These buff and polish your make-up to perfection. **** QUICK FIXES Brush care Use baby shampoo to clean your brushes regularly. It works just as well as harsh detergents, but is gentler on both the brushes and on your skin. Leave them to air-dry overnight. ***** ASK IRENE Is it absolutely necessary to use special brushes for make-up application? Cindy, Nairobi. Yes. The new textures of make-up such as matte and long-lasting foundations and powders call for modified tools.

DORTMUND Thomas Tuchel stressed Borussia Dortmund must try to overcome Tuesday's bomb attack on the German team's bus, but admitted it was still "incredibly difficult" to speak about the ordeal. "We must find a way of overcoming that. But we still don't know how that's going to happen," the Dortmund coach said Thursday, a day after Tuchel's side lost 3-2 to Monaco in the rescheduled first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Three explosions rocked the Dortmund team coach as it made its way to Signal Iduna Park ahead of Tuesday's planned kick-off, forcing the match to be postponed until Wednesday. Spanish international defender Marc Bartra underwent emergency surgery for a broken wrist and to remove glass that became planted in his arm after the blasts shattered windows on the team bus. "Everyone must face up to it in their own may. No one felt it in exactly the same way," said Tuchel, with Dortmund offering to provide counselling for the players. "Some players saw the explosion... there were lots of different feelings and therefore many different ways of handling the trauma." Tuchel slammed Uefa on Wednesday over the decision to go ahead with the fixture less than 24 hours after the harrowing events. "I complimented the team, they showed character and lots of courage. Now we need, with time, to find a way to enjoy being on the pitch again... but the best athlete is the one without any worries." Dortmund's next game is at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday.   Dortmund were defeated 3-2 by the French club in the first leg of the quarter-final on Wednesday.

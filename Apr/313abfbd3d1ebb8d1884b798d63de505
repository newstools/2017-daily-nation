The Independent Policing Oversight Authority has dispatched its Rapid Response Unit to investigate alleged extrajudicial killing in Nairobi's Eastleigh. The step came about after a viral video purportedly showed a police officer shooting a suspected criminal dead. The clip surfaced on Friday and was shared on social media evoking mixed responses from Kenyans. Mr Dennis Danson Oketch, Ipoa's communications boss, in a statement said the investigation will determine the facts relating to the incident. "Upon conclusion, the Authority will make recommendations and forward the investigation file to the ODPP for his attention." More importantly, the statement indicated that Ipoa will practice transparency and accountability, to avoid trampling on human rights.

The same gangsters shot dead another officer yesterday. Tell all gangsters out there that when they kill an officer, I am ruthless and they will get it from me. And you can quote me on that," Mr Koome said. On the other hand, Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet said a probe into the matter is the way to go. “The law is very clear. And do not push me to contradict the law (support the killing). I have said my position is clear that an investigation will be done,” Mr Boinnet said.

The National Cohesion and Integration Commission has urged Kenyans to remain calm despite the increasing political temperatures. Prof Gitile Naituli, a commissioner, said that chaos witnessed during the ODM and Jubilee Party nominations should not be a cause for panic as it is "a natural part of political rivalry". "Politics are very emotive and that is what Kenyans have been witnessing. It is not a reason to panic,‚Äù Prof Naituli said at Nessuit Primary School in Njoro where he officiated the third Ogiek Cultural Festival. Prof Naituli added that the commission would have its officers, Cohesion Monitors, attend political events such as rallies to monitor the nature of messages being propagated. He said that is one of the ways of clamping down on hate messages. They will use cameras and other gadgets to capture messages that may be used when prosecuting perpetrators. "We realise that using an audio as evidence in court is a big challenge. We will now try videos since they are more credible than voice," Prof Naituli added. Several leaders among them Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, his Kabete counterpart Ferdinand Waititu and Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama have been indicted for hate speech; however their cases were thrown out.

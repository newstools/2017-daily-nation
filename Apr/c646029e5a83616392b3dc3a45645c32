Maseno School's board of management has resigned in protest following the interdiction of former Principal Paul Otula. The board has rejected the new principal, Andrew Buop, saying he has a tainted past. Board members also said their resignation was also a protest against the process of replacing Mr Otula, adding that the Ministry of Education and the Teachers Service Commission was undermining them. Mr Otula was interdicted in March following a claim by a Form One student that he had been sodomised by other students. The TSC handed Mr Otula a 30-day suspension and posted Mr Buop, then a principal at Homa Bay High School, to replace him. Following Mr Otulaâ€™s suspension, teachers from Kisumu threatened to stage a demonstration to demand his reinstatement. Maseno School students had in March also gone on the rampage protesting the interdiction of their principal.   Learning was paralysed at Maseno School after students held a protest.

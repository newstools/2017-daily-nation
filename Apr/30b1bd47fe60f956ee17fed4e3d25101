The Kenya Police light flyweight boxer, Shaffi Bakari, fought tooth and nail to beat his Kenyatta National Hospital’s opponent, Matayo Keya, by a split point decision in a thrilling three-round final of the second leg of the SportPesa Kenya Boxing Association National League at Nanyuki Community Hall at the weekend. Kenya Police, popularly known as ‘Chafua Chafua’, won with 25 points. Nairobi County Boxing Association secretary, Musa Benjamin, who was at the ringside said: “The two boxers gave it all in their bout. It was one game that would have gone either way as the boxers exchanged blows from the first to the last round.” Bakari’s win put his team on right footing as they emerged winners of the league with 25 points, six points ahead of their archrivals, Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) as Prisons settled for third spot with five points. KDF won the first leg of the league in Kisumu last month. The KDF light heavyweight, Nick Abaka, was eliminated in the semifinals by Elly Ajowi (Police). Abaka was one of the three Kenyan boxers who took part in the disbanded AIBA pro-boxing.Welterweight Rayton Okwiri (Prisons) and bantamweight Benson Gicharu (Police) were the others.

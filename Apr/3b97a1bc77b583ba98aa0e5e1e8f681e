A parliamentary aspirant has been admitted at a Eldoret hospital after he was attacked on Tuesday by people said to be his rivalâ€™s supporters. Kesses parliamentary aspirant Swarup Mishra was holding a meeting at Royalton hotel, according to his team, when he was accosted by a charged crowd who were said to be campaigning for Allan Kosgey. Dr Mishra sustained neck and stomach injuries and rushed to Mediheal hospital in Eldoret Town.   His doctor, Parag Patil, said the Jubilee aspirant had difficulties in breathing and complained of a sharp neck pain which he sustained as a result of the confrontation. "A team of doctors from the hospital are working together to monitor his condition. At the moment we cannot say whether he is out of danger or in danger but we shall keep on updating you," Dr Patil told journalists at the hospital. BAD IMAGE Dr Mishra's campaign Chairman Joe Kirwa condemned the incident saying that it was giving Jubilee Party a bad image. "All of us are in one party. Such hooliganism should not be tolerated. All we want is democracy to prevail and we are appealing to the top leadership of Jubilee to take stern action against perpetrators of this incident," said Mr Kirwa.   Mr Kirwa said that despite the incident Dr Mishra's team is determined to go on with their campaign activities ahead of party nominations. But in a quick rejoinder, supporters of Mr Kosgey distanced themselves from the incident claiming that Dr Mishra was the one who stormed the hotel where they were having a meeting to strategise for the day leading to the confrontation. POLICE CALLED "Dr Mishra stormed the venue of our meeting which irked our members who asked him to leave but his security team confronted our members leading to the incident," said Ms Ruth Cheptoo.   During the scuffle, window panes and security lights were smashed. A contingent of anti-riot police officers from Kiambaa Police Station were called in to quell the situation that threatened to get out of hand.

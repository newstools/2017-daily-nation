Parents of Kauthene Primary School in Meru are protesting over dilapidated Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) classrooms that they say pose health hazards to their children.They want the county government to revive a stalled classrooms project that began in 2015 before the contractor left.A spot check by the Nation revealed that the walls of the two iron sheet shacks are full of holes while pupils have to sit on stones and makeshift desks on a dusty floor.Mr Paul Mugambi, a parent, said the classrooms were built in 1987 and parents have been replacing rusty iron sheets since then. Our children are always suffering from jigger infestations, iron sheet cuts and colds due to the poor condition of the classrooms, Mr Mugambi said.The two rooms accommodate 150 ECDE pupils.PROJECT FAILEDKauthene Board of Management Secretary Jacob Mutumiria said the county government s effort to upgrade the dilapidated classrooms failed in 2015. The contractor came and built the foundation in February 2015 but he abandoned the project in March 2015. We have been following up but county officials say there is no money, Mr Mutumiria said.Kiagu MCA Richard Mwangi said the Kauthene ECDE classroom project was among the first to be constructed under devolution. The contractor fled after constructing the foundation. We have a meeting with the county Education chief officer to ensure another contractor takes over, Mr Mwangi said.The county government has been putting up equipped ECDE classrooms to improve learning conditions for children.Efforts to reach the county government education officials for comment did not bear fruit. email print email print

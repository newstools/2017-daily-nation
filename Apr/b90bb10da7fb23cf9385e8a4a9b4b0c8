LOS ANGELES Lost in the excitement surrounding the Cleveland Cavaliers stunning 26-point rally to beat the Indian Pacers Thursday was LeBron James moving into third place on the NBA's all-time playoff scoring list. James nailed a three-point shot in the first half to give him 13 for the game and 5,641 for his playoff career, passing Kobe Bryant for the third spot in postseason scoring. Only Michael Jordan, with 5,987 points, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 5,762, have more playoff points than James. Bryant needed 220 games to reach his total, while James did it in just 202 career playoff games. James finished with 41 points to help the reigning NBA champion Cavaliers come back from a 26-point deficit to stun Indiana 119-114 in game three of their first round series. "For me, it's always just about trying to get better and being the best that I can be. That's what I was trying to do tonight," said James who won his 20th consecutive first round postseason game. James also surpassed Bryant to take over fourth spot on the all-time playoff three point list.   Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers 119-114 on Thursday.

BEIJING China has launched its first domestically designed and built aircraft carrier, as the country seeks to transform its navy into a force capable of projecting power onto the high seas. Beijing has embarked on an extensive project to build a “blue water” navy and modernise its two million-strong military, the world’s largest. The country’s rapidly expanding military might includes a range of maritime defence capabilities, a fleet of attack submarines and highly sophisticated anti-aircraft systems that prevent enemy vessels from nearing its coast. President Xi Jinping has said all must be done to improve the country’s battle capacities “so we can fight and win wars”. Adorned with colourful ribbons, the Type 001A ship transferred from dry dock into the water at a the launch ceremony in the port city of Dalian, according to official broadcaster CCTV. NUCLEAR PROPULSION The ribbon-cutting was followed by the traditional breaking of a champagne bottle on the bow. The defence ministry says the new carrier would displace 50,000 tonnes and use conventional rather than nuclear propulsion. It is expected to carry China’s indigenous J-15 aircraft, along with other planes. The country is eager to show its might in the South China Sea, where it insists on sovereignty over virtually all the resource-rich waters despite rival claims from its southeast Asian neighbours. RECLAIMED REEFS It has extensively reclaimed reefs and installed military and other facilities, including airstrips on some outcrops, dismissing an international tribunal’s ruling last year that rejected China’s claims to the disputed areas. Analysts said the ship represents a status symbol for Beijing in a contested region but poses little threat to US carriers. “The launch is symbolic because it will take about two years for the vessel to be equipped and to make its first tests overboard,” said Juliette Genevaz, a China researcher at the France-based Military School Strategic Research Institute.

Police in Gatundu South, Kiambu County, have arrested three suspects allegedly found in a vehicle loaded with crude weapons in Ichaweri Village. The offices, acting on a tip from the public, impounded the Toyota Noah, which the suspects were allegedly using with the intent to disrupt voting in party primaries. Among the weapons found were wooden batons and slashers, which were all new. Campaign materials bearing the names of three aspirants for the constituencyâ€™s seat were also found in the car, whose rear bumper and number plates had been removed. Police want to establish who among the three candidates was behind the incident and what the motive was. Witnesses told reporters that the suspects were in a convoy of close to 10 vehicles. Former Gatundu South MP Moses Mwihia said residents became suspicious of the convoy because the occupants of the cars were unruly. When they realised they had been cornered, most of the suspects escaped but the three were unlucky.

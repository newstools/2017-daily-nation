National Super League debutants Kibera Black Stars on Friday chalked up their first win of the season by beating MOSCA 1-0 at the Camp Toyoyo Grounds in Nairobi. Ronald Reagan struck in the 35th minute of the match to give the Kibera-based team a first win in seven games to pull away from the bottom of the NSL table where MOSCA and Agrochemicals lie for being winless so far. In another match played at the same venue, former SportPesa Premier League side Ushuru were held to a one-all draw by GFE 105. The taxmen were in real danger of losing the match after falling behind in the 55th minute, but Congolese striker Lnamba Bebeto equalised with 10 minutes to salvage a point for his team. GFE, which means Global Field Evangelism, went ahead in the 55th minute through Mukumu Boys teenager Boniface Mukhekhe and held on to that score for the next 25 minutes. Bebeto, formerly of Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka, however spoiled their march to victory just ten minutes to time when he converted a penalty. Isibania, who finished top of the Division One Zone ‘B’ last season, brushed aside Modern Coast Rangers 1-0 at the Awendo Green Stadium to record a second successive win. WEEKEND FIXTURES Striker Felix Okik came through with the decisive goal of the match in the 80th minute to condemn the visitors to their third loss of the season. Former top tier side Nairobi City Stars will chase their fourth win of the season as they entertain KCB at Camp Toyoyo, while Vihiga United will be at their home turf in Mumias to entertain seventh placed Nakuru All Stars.

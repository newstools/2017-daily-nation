Elders in the Boni minority community in Lamu have urged national-government administrators in Lamu County to help them access monthly stipends issued by Nairobi. Speaking in Pandanguo on Thursday, the elders said it is unfair that they have not received a penny since the programme started while the rest of their counterparts across the country continue to enjoy the benefit. Through their spokesperson Musa Guyo, they accused the government of marginalising them, saying they had been deliberately left out of the programme. They said many elders from the Boni community were living in abject poverty since they are no longer able to go out and cater for themselves and their families due to their advanced age. They said it was unfair that many have been dying without getting the money though the programme is intended for all senior citizens in the country. “Why must we be left out of everything? Are we not deserving enough? We need urgent intervention so that we also receive such funds,” said Mr Guyo. For his side, 90-year-old Tenau Samunu Duwaa urged the government to increase the monthly stipend given to the elderly from Sh2,000 to at least Sh3,500. Mr Duwaa said the Sh2,000 is too little considering that many of the elders especially in hardship areas like Pandanguo end up spending more due to the high cost of living. Lamu County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri assured the elders that they would receive the money soon. Mr Kanyiri asked all elders in the county to register at the relevant offices and that the money will be released once the number of elders is ascertained. He also revealed that the government had partnered with the Kenya Red Cross Society to have each family affected by drought together and elders receive Sh4,800 monthly apart from the food aid that the national government continues to distribute in the region.

The country is awash with posters and banners of people preparing to vie in the coming elections. The campaign materials cost a fortune to produce and serve a key purpose during electioneering, but they can be an eyesore and at times a health hazard. While the aspirants are enthusiastically hoisting the materials now, they are often quickly forgotten after elections. This is why a suggestion by the National Environment Management Authority that all aspirants be required to pay for the clean-up of the election waste is spot on. Nema seeks to introduce an environment deposit bond fee to be paid by those responsible for the litter. Election waste is a global problem and a challenge for counties to clean up, considering the importance of the election and the right of the aspirants to express themselves and sell their policies through the printed materials. However, while the proposal seems plausible, Nema must convince the public that it has the capacity to clear the mess across the country. This is because it has done fairly badly in carrying out its ordinary regulatory mandate. Perhaps, the political parties should be enlisted and committed to remove all the election materials used by their candidates. A heavy penalty should be imposed on individuals and parties that donâ€™t get rid of the clutter. But most importantly, Nema should prescribe practical and enforceable solutions to the menace.

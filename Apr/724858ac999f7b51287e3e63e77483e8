School heads have been asked to give students opportunities to fully participate in co-curricular activities. Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang said children had untapped and undeveloped potential and schools should provide opportunities for them to realise culture, arts and sporting activities. Dr Kipsang cautioned the institutions against hiring strangers to represent their schools thereby denying their learners opportunities to exploit their talents and abilities. “The planned curriculum will aim at nurturing the potential of every student,” said Dr Kipsang during this year’s Kenya Drama Festival (gala) winners’ concert at Tom Mboya Labour College. The PS said the curriculum aims at developing the intellectual, social and emotional growth of the child, hence the importance of the arts, sports and culture. He challenged media houses to tap into the creative abilities and displays of Kenyan children had shown in drama and music festival and air them in their media platforms. “Let’s have the good news of our people appreciated by media audiences of our media houses,” Dr Kipsang noted. Kisumu County Commissioner Maalim Mohamed said such activities help to instil right values in the learners.

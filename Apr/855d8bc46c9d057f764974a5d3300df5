Q: Why do I need to oil my hair before washing it with shampoo?  A: It does seem counterintuitive to apply oil to your dry hair before washing it, especially since the oil will literally go down the drain. Pre-poo treatments actually originated from India. Prior to washing their hair, women would grease it with oil sometimes mixed with ayurvedic herbs. This resulted in silky, shiny hair after washing. This same principle applies for curly or coily textured hair because when you apply a surfactant such as shampoo or detergent to your hair, it can strip the hair of its natural oils. Pre-poo masks or treatments are also popular in Caucasian hair salons because they repair and protect damaged hair. Regardless of hair type, women today opt for more manipulative styles such as hair dying, keratin treatments, braids, Brazilian blow-outs and extensions. An active lifestyle also means hair has a build-up of sweat or chlorine from exercise. Pre-poo oils help lift residue from hard water and various products, ranging from hairspray to leave in conditioner. Pre-poo treatments also moisturise your scalp, helping to reduce flakes and dandruff. -

A Nanyuki court has ordered a public inquest to establish the circumstances surrounding the death of a 10-year-old pupil following an alleged beating by her teacher. The inquest follows the acquittal of a teacher who had been accused of beating the Standard Three pupil to death in January. Venezio Njuguna Maina, the deputy headteacher of Mukandamia Primary School in Solio, Laikipia County, was set free by a court after an autopsy report said the minor died of congested vessels of the intestinal walls. In medical terms, Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor stated the cause of death as complications of peritonitis, a fungal or bacterial infection caused by an underlying medical condition or a treatment device such as dialysis or a feeding tube. AUTOPSY REPORT The autopsy report was presented in court last month and the prosecution said it failed to directly link the death of the pupil to the beatings she allegedly received from the teacher. Senior Resident Magistrate Evans Ngigi declared the matter closed, set free Mr Maina and advised prosecutors to apply through the chief magistrate’s court for an inquest to held. On Wednesday, Laikipia Central Police boss Ben Changulo confirmed that a public inquest will start on June 21 following directives issued by the court. Mr Changulo said he had lined up a number of witnesses, including Mr Maina, medics who treated the girl, Dr Oduor, the girl’s guardian and some pupils from the school who witnessed the alleged beatings meted out on the girl three days before she died.   The 49-year-old Venezio Njuguna Maina was arrested at a hideout near his home in Chaka.

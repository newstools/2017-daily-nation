Over 300 athletes will compete in this year’s eighth edition of the Watamu Triathlon that was launched at the Turtle Bay Beach Resort on Tuesday. The energy-sapping competition will be held on April 29 and 30 and will involve both local and international athletes of all ages. Kenya triathlon champion, Swaleh Balala, who attended Tuesday’s launch presided over by Turtle Bay Beach Resort general manager, Damien Davis, will be seeking to defend his title in the main event which will be used as a blue print for the selection of triathletes for the Commonwealth Games. The Watamu Triathlon is the first pan-African triathlon of the year that brings together both amateur and professional, local and international athletes to showcase their prowess and endurance in swimming, cycling and running. Held at the Turtle Bay Beach Resort, the aim of the triathlon is to grow the sport with this year’s theme being to develop the local community’s economic diversity and, in turn, enhance sports and domestic tourism in the area. The triathlon is a multi-stage athletic sport consisting three different events — and Olympic 1.5-kilometre swim in the sea, 40 kilometres of cycling and a 10-kilometre run all designed to test an athletes’ endurance. Peter Ngome, the Watamu community organizer, urged the locals to turn up in large numbers to participate. “The community at large has benefited from the event as it has played a big role in enriching our lives through tourism,” he added. Davis welcomed all to the event saying: “This is a great sporting event and a must attend for people of all ages as we seek to make the sport something great in Kenya.” He thanked the participants, sponsors and spectators for the growth of the event over the years. For those attending the event, Turtle Bay Beach Resort is giving a special rate of Sh6,000 per person on full board basis, a perfect getaway for the Labour Day weekend.

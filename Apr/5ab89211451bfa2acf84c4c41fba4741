The ODM disciplinary committee has cracked the whip on members involved in recent chaos in the run-up to party nominations that started Thursday. Nominated Senator Elizabeth Ongoro has been fined Sh1 million and told to vie in a constituency other than Ruaraka, where she had been planning to battle it out with incumbent MP TJ Kajwang. Last week, Ms Ongoro stormed Orange House accompanied by rowdy youths complaining that the party had decided to give a direct nomination to Mr Kajwang and thus denying her a chance to vie for the Ruaraka seat on ODM. The committee has also told her to publicly apologise to the party and party executive director Oduor Ong'wen, who was roughed up by the youths during the incident. The senator has to comply with the committee’s recommendations within seven days, failing which she will be disqualified from contesting. OKOTH OBADO At the same time, Migori Governor Okoth Obado was ordered to pay a fine of Sh2 million for ordering youths to storm party offices and for the violence witnessed in Migori recently. He should also submit a written apology to party leader Raila Odinga. He is also expected to comply with the ruling within seven days or he will be disqualified from running on the party’s ticket. Ruaraka MP TJ Kajwang' was cautioned and asked to contain his supporters against engaging in violence and also reaffirm his commitment to the party. CAUTIONED The committee also recommended that Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong and Funyula MP Paul Otuoma be reprimanded and cautioned to control their supporters prior to, during and after the party nominations. They are also to reaffirm their commitment to the party's code of conduct. However, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, senators James Orengo (Siaya) and Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu) and Suna East MP Junet Mohamed were let off the hook as there were no recommendations against them.   County boss says it was an attempt to assassinate opposition leaders.

Operators say introduction of tourism service vehicle stickers that distinguish tour vans from public service vehicles, would help weed out unscrupulous players. Firms had for years been lobbying for their introduction in efforts to regulate the sector. They were finally launched last week by Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala. Although tour vans are supposed to offer service to tourists going on safari, they had been categorised as public service vehicles. As a result, illegal tour operators took advantage of the lack of distinction to ferry visitors to national parks and game reserves. Use of matatus had affected standards as they are not modified for game drives that often pass through rough terrains. The Kenya Association of Tour Operators (Kato) Coast branch chairperson Monika Solanki said the move create comfort as well as sanity. “The tour vans are specially made vehicles for safari so that holidaymakers can travel in comfort as well as give them ample space for game viewing in the parks,” she said. “Since tour vans and matatus were both treated as public service vehicles, some illegal tour firms took advantage of the loophole to ferry tourists to the parks using matatus.”Southern Sky Safaris Managing Director Philemon Mwavala said the stickers would lock out illegal tour operators. The tour operator added that the separation of tour vehicles from public vehicles would help improve the transportation of tourists and make them get value for their money.

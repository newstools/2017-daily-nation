ANC primaries in Vihiga County were on Saturday delayed due to hitches in distribution of voting materials. By 10am, all the five constituencies of Sabatia, Vihiga, Hamisi, Luanda and Emuhaya were yet to receive ballot boxes and papers. County elections officials were still holed up at Mbale police station where the materials had been stored. A spot check by Nation at various poling centres around Mbale town revealed voters had already arrived to take part in the process. The chair of county election board Moses Oburu said voting was delayed due to logistical challenges. "We planned to start at 8am but this will be delayed by an extra one hour. The ballot papers arrived late and we are in the process of verifying and sorting them out ready for distribution," said Mr Oburu.

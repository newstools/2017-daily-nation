THE CURRENT WATER shortage calls for extra measures to ensure the little available is properly used. When the skin is not properly cleaned on a daily basis, it is easy to develop fungal infections and body odour. It is possible to have a full skin clean up everyday using less than one litre of water. A complete bath using this quantity of water is known as French bath: It originated in France in the 16 th century during a period of a frigid winter where the taps ran dry for months. Back then, bathing was a great luxury. Full baths were reserved for a once-weekly ritual. You need one litre cold water, a bowl, soap or shower gel, and a wash cloth. Wash your face using your hands.Â  squeeze the washcloth in the water and rub some soap onto it. If you are using shower gel, pour a small quantity onto the wet cloth. Rub the cloth all over your skin, taking care to clean all the folds. Rinse out the cloth and then rub it over your skin once more, this time without any soap. Repeat the process if there is any soapy residue remaining. Wipe yourself dry with a towel. Shower-in-a-tube: This is a new innovation created for long distance travellers. It is found in airline travel kits. It is formulated to give instant coolness and cleaning when it is applied directly onto the skin. Cleansing tissues: This is a more resilient version of disposable cleansing wipes designed to cleanse the whole body. They contain a soapy liquid which dissolves into the skin making it unnecessary to use water to rinse it off.

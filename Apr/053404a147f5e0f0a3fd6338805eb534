President Uhuru Kenyatta has maintained that his main aim is to advocate for peace and unite the country. Saying that no country can develop without peace and unity, President Kenyatta called on all Kenyans to shun tribalism. “My main aim is to see Kenya peaceful and united because that way we will achieve greater things as a people and as a nation,” he said. PRAYING FOR COUNTRYMr Kenyatta spoke when he joined the Maa Community for the 18th interdenominational prayers for the country at Ngatataek in Kajiado County. The annual prayers, which bring together churches in the Maa community regions, were organised by the Inter-Ministry Union (IMU) under the chairmanship of Bishop Peter Mangura. President Kenyatta said the challenges facing the country will not be solved by divisive politics, but through unity of purpose. “We are all Kenyans and we should use our diversity to prosper the country but not to fragment it,” President Kenyatta appealed. NO VIOLENCE The Head of State commended Kajiado residents for holding peaceful party nominations, saying that enabled them to pick the leaders of their choice without interference. The President also thanked the people of Kajiado for living in harmony, noting that they have never fought because of politics. He equally appreciated the role played by the clergy in promoting peace, observing that their prayers have paid dividend and should be emulated by other religious leaders. Bishop Mangura led the prayers and gave a sermon. NATIONAL COHESIONThe Bishop prayed for the President and for a peaceful electioneering period. “....we pray that the August elections will be non-violent,” Bishop Mangura said. He said the church has a duty to pray for peace and to be at the forefront in promoting cohesion. Other speakers included Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery and MPs Katoo ole Metito (Kajiado South), Peris Tobiko (Kajiado East) and Joseph Manje (Kajiado North), among others.

Former Director of Public Prosecutions Philip Murgor has shelved his presidential ambitions barely four months after announcing his bid. Mr Murgor cited tribalism, inadequate funds and violation of election rules as the setbacks to his State House quest. He said leadership — and by extension the presidency — had become a matter of who can galvanise tribal numbers “using vast amounts of unexplained, illegally obtained money”. “Presidential campaigns are largely driven by tribalism. The main formations coalesce around an ethnic leader, after which, everyone else is a traitor or spoiler,” he said. The lawyer added that he was repeatedly being asked where he could obtain the required support from a tribal base and billions of shillings needed for his campaign. CHANGE CORRUPTION “I have come to the realisation that I announced and embarked on my bid for the presidency too late in the present unregulated and free-for-all circumstances,” he told journalists on Sunday. Mr Murgor said his decision to contest the presidency was driven by the urge “to change corruption and ethnicity that characterises Kenya’s politics”. “Voters, particularly the less fortunate ones, have fallen prey to this addictive corruption-driven electioneering, and have been conditioned to appreciate those ready to bribe them,” he said. DEMAND CASH “Such voters have learnt to expect and demand cash as a condition to participate in campaigns at all levels, including attending rallies.” Mr Murgor, who was to take on President Kenyatta on a United Democratic Movement ticket, said one of his campaign managers deserted him “because I could not accept funds from a drug baron”. He said Kenya needed an honest, courageous and a leader committed to good governance and not those who looked to their ethnic communities for support.

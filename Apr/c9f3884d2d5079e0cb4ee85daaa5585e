There was chaos at Kanja Primary School in Embu during the Jubilee Party nominations after a group of youths prevented Runyenjes MP Cecily Mbarire from forming a second stream at the centre. About 1,000 voters who had showed up were engaged in a push and shove when Ms Mbarire arrived and demanded for creation of a second voting centre. However, a group of youths accused the MP, who is seeking the Jubilee gubernatorial ticket, of trying to rig the election by conversing with the poll officials while she had already cast her vote. They started singing outside the centre, threatening to eject Ms Mbarire, forcing the two Administration Police officers manning the polling station to call for reinforcement. Ms Mbarire accused the youths of being used by her rival to cause chaos at the centre, which is her stronghold, so that voting could be paralysed. STOOD GROUND She stood her ground insisting that she would not be intimidated. “This is my home turf and everyone must be allowed to vote for the person of their choice. The youth who had been sent to paralyse the exercise will not deter me. I dare anyone who is brave enough to prevent me. We will open a new stream whether you like it or not,” she roared. The centre has 1,200 registered voters and had been supplied ballot materials for two streams and an additional presiding officer but voting was only being conducted in only one classroom. There was also confusion after ballot papers belonging to Mwea Ward in Mbeere South were found in Mbiruri in Runyenjes Constituency. There was also a shortage of ballot materials in 11 polling centres in Mbeti South Ward. Earlier on, voting was delayed for about three hours after the poll officials distributed the ballot materials late.

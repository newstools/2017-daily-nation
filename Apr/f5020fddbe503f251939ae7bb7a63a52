In the last few months, there have been numerous warnings, including in this newspaper, that the plague of armyworms that has been destroying crops across most of southern Africa was steadily moving towards East Africa. Ominously, the type of pest that was destroying livelihoods was largely reported to be the Fall armyworm — usually associated with the Americas — whose attacks on maize, wheat, millet and other staple foods is more difficult to deal with as it is resistant to many pesticides. The armyworm invasion has now reached Kenya with reports that at least 11 counties are affected, including parts of Trans Nzoia, Kakamega and Bungoma where much of the country’s maize is grown. Even though the Agriculture ministry now says it has launched a team that brings together various experts to deal with the pest, we hope this is not a case of too little too late. While we acknowledge it is not a task as straightforward as dealing with the African armyworm, we would expect that by now the authorities should have put together a solid plan, including consulting countries that have experience in handling such invasions, considering that this was foreseen months earlier. The experts dealing with the situation must realise that any failure to control the armyworms has implications on food security. It is, therefore, a matter that must be given the priority it deserves.

Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC) has dismissed as propaganda reports that the National Super Alliance (Nasa) has settled on ODM’s Raila Odinga and Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka as the coalition’s flag-bearers in the August elections. ANC, one of the four members of the coalition formed in February, says there are 12 combinations of the four leaders being considered and that a final decision has not been reached. Secretary-General Godfrey Osotsi told reporters in Nairobi that none of the four contenders is a front-runner. "Any of the four principals has an equal chance of being chosen as the flag-bearer and hence respective parties must prepare their candidates," he said. "We urge ANC supporters to be on the lookout and totally reject opportunistic propaganda and mischievous lies thrown around through mainstream media, social media and other means of communication to disorganise us," he added. Mr Mudavadi, Mr Odinga, Mr Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula of Ford-Kenya are all seeking the Nasa presidential ticket. But opinion polls and the grapevine suggest a combination of Mr Odinga and Mr Musyoka stands a better chance of beating Jubilee’s Uhuru Kenyatta. ANC officials said they are vouching for their man but will be ready to support the final decision reached on the Nasa candidate if it follows agreed-upon tenets within the coalition.

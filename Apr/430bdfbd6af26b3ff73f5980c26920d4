About 1,200 pupils are expected to compete in the 35th Kenya National Primary School Games and Gymnastics at Kaaga Primary School in Meru County from Wednesday. Some of the teams from eight regions have already started arriving in Meru in preparation for the competition. A total of eight teams from each region will take part in the games, which include football, netball, volleyball, handball and gymnastics for both boys and girls. Speaking at Kaaga Girls Secondary School during a referees’ clinic, Kenya National Primary School Games and Gymnastics (KNPSG) chairman Rashid Mbalo said all is set for the tournament. This year’s edition has, however, faced a major challenge after the withdrawal of the main sponsors, Milo, who has been sponsoring the games for the last eight consecutive years. “We are currently training referees to ensure there is a free and fair officiating of matches. We have eight referees from every region two in each discipline,” Mbalo said. He said the referees are also updated on the new rules introduced in the games to avoid disputes. GOVERNMENT SPONSORS Mbalo said security will be tight in the villages where the pupils are sleeping, and in the playing ground. According to the games national co-ordinator Inoti Kimathi, the national government has sponsored this year’s games while some counties have offered to provide uniforms for coaches and participants. “We do not have an official sponsor in this year’s editions. We appreciate the effort of the Ministry of Education who offered to sponsor the games as a way of nurturing young talents in the country,” Inoti said. The national finals are a representation of the top schools from the regions across Kenya previously known as provinces.   Damaris Riana will pursue a degree in Actuarial Science.

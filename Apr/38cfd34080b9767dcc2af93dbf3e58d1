In January, the government released Sh20 million for the work. Mr Serian said reconstruction of a classroom that was burnt down by the terrorists at Pandanguo Primary School in July 2014 will be given priority. Other projects include rebuilding the Mpeketoni sub-county offices and the Basuba Health Centre and repairing Mangai Boarding Primary School, all of which were torched during the attacks. Mr Serian said the work will be completed in three months. He also commended Boni residents for their continued cooperation with security agencies. “I am pleased with the patience and cooperation on the part of the Bonis. Through the good cooperation between the Bonis and our security agencies, we have been able to flush out the culprits from the Boni forest,” he said. Operation Linda Boni was launched on September 15, 2015 by Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery to eject the Shabaab militants believed to be hiding and operating from the dense forest.

A group of sitting volleyball players in Nakuru are appealing for support from the county government and well-wishers. The team comprising 18 men and 15 women have been training at Afraha stadium in Nakuru for the last two years, but according to coach Florence Ofwenje, they have not been able to make strides owing to lack of funds. “We have been training for long without getting an opportunity to play nationally because we don’t have funds or support from the government,” Ofwenje told Nation Sport Tuesday. Ofwenje said they have trained their sights on getting a number of their players in Team Kenya for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games. “We have a good team that can play well in the national league and even represent the country in various championships including the Paralympics.”

Q: I recently bought some oil from a product vendor and he swore that it contained two very potent natural oils and essential oils. I tried it and it seems fake. How can I tell the quality of ingredients?  A: Product labels do not always contain comprehensive information, and some labels are more accurate than others. If a product is primarily an oil, start by smelling it. Ask if you can test a few drops on your fingers or skin. If it contains rich oils like avocado, macadamia, castor or moringa, you should notice a thicker consistency and a deeper colour. Oils which are light in consistency and colour often are made up of corn oil as a base, or sunflower oil. These are not bad for the hair, but they contain fewer conditioning benefits than the expensive oils the products may claim to contain. Be wary of product mixes with unclear labelling from individuals or small businesses you are not familiar with. In such cases, it is better to buy the individual oils from vendors and mix your own at home. If they claim it contains essential oils, the fragrance should be noticeably strong. Some individuals are even selling coconut oil mixed with petroleum jelly as a hair pomade. Look for the KEBS (Kenya Bureau of Standards) icon or check out the personâ€™s social media, FB and website for testimonials and recommendations.

The poor performance by Kenya Prisons and Kenya Pipeline in the just-concluded Africa Clubs Volleyball Championships in Tunisia is worrying. Kenya Prisons, who have won the tournament five times, settled for a bronze, with Pipeline, who have also won the diadem seven times, finished fifth. Kenyan clubs are yet to win since Prisonsâ€™ victory in 2013 as Pipeline and Prisons lost in the final in 2014 and 2015. It is evident that Kenyans clubs have been losing the grip to their northern African opponents. GSP Algiers from Algeria won in 2014, Al Ahly from Egypt, in 2015 and 2016 and Carthage from Tunisia in 2017. NATIONAL TEAM PERFORMANCE This has also been reflected in the national team performance. Kenya failed to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and the 2014 World Championships. The clubs must now change their tactics if they are to regain their groove against their rivals. Kenyan standards have stagnated hence the need to upgrade coaching besides stepping up youth programmes. Most players either at club or national levels have been in the system for long hence the need for new blood. We appreciate the role Kenya Prisons and Pipeline managements have continued to play in nurturing talent. This has ensured strong club and national representation. The government, too, needs to play its part by providing appropriate training facilities.

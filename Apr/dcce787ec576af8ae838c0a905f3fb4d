Kenya Rugby Union director of development John Kilonzo and Kenya Hockey Union chairman Nashon Randiek are among those bidding to unseat the current secretary general Francis K. Paul at next month’s National Olympic of Kenya elections. Also in the running for this influential position is current Kenya Table Tennis Association boss Andrew Mudibo, who has been serving as interim secretary in a splinter group that has for the past eight months been fighting for a change in guard. The eagerly awaited polling exercise will be held at the Panari Hotel on May 5, in the wake of yesterday’s directive by the Nock Electoral Board’s secretary Irene Tindi. Speaking to Nation Sport on Thursday, Randiek promised to cater for the interests of “marginalised sports” if elected. “My candidature is for all sports that feel left out. There is no need in electing someone who will forget about is when he gets to power. I feel I can do a good job if given the mandate,” he said. Paul, meanwhile, is battling embezzlement and mismanagement charges levelled against him by the government. Other members seeking elective positions in this are former marathoner Paul Tergat, who is eyeing the presidency and will challenge incumbent Kipchoge Keino, Jackson Tuwei (second vice president) along with Julius Mwangi, Paul Otula and Lillian Mduda who are all looking to be elected as the committee members. The Electoral Board from the Centre for Multi-Party Democracy (CMD) has, meanwhile, set aside April 22-25 as dates for the verification exercise of both the voters and candidates. The board will be chaired by CMD Kenya representative Omweri Angima with other members being Irene Tindi, Carey Francis Onyango and Duncan Anzala. The Appeal Board Tribunal comprises of lawyers David Mereka, Lucas Oluoch and Lucal Lepere Naikuni.   It’s not easy being an Athletics Kenya selector.

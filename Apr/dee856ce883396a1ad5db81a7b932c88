I am happy that the ruling has given a clear picture of what happened on the ground. If the party fails to issue me with the certificate then I will move on to the political parties tribunal to demand that I be issued with the certificate on account of results from my agents which indicate a win with a margin of 2,000 against Mr Were, said Mr Ongiri. email print email print

The ODM National Elections Board (NEB) has nullified the results of the Busia gubernatorial nominations, just hours after Governor Sospeter Ojaamong was declared winner. The results were rejected by his closest competitor, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, and his supporters. In a statement, NEB chairperson Judith Pareno said the board had noticed major irregularities in the Busia gubernatorial nomination process “which if announced as is can cause discordance among members in the County”. “In view of the above reasons, the Board has made a decision to nullify the Busia gubernatorial nomination results and ordered a repeat exercise on Tuesday 25th April 2017,” the statement said. However, results for other seats will remain as they were received, Ms Pareno said. The board also received results from returning officers in Bungoma and Machakos counties, which also conducted their nominations on Thursday. Earlier, after Mr Ojaamong was announced the winner in the Busia ODM race, Dr Otuoma’s supporters held protests to show their dissatisfaction. Mr Ojaamong declined to comment on the nullification of his election. “I can't discuss the matter because I am yet to get an official communication from the board. "How could that happen even before a formal complaint is lodged? The results have just been announced a while ago by the county elections committee," he said Mr Ojaamong and Dr Otuoma are said to have rushed to Nairobi to meet the ODM leadership on then impasse.

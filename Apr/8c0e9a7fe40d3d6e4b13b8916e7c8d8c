Senate aspirant Carlos Kioko has faulted Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama for fighting the governor.Mr Kioko said the county has failed to realise development, including the building of a new city, because of the rivalry between Mr Muthama and Governor Alfred Mutua. Speaking at the Mulu Mutisya Gardens on Friday during a question and answer session with residents, Mr Kioko said he will chaperon the County Assembly to pass the necessary legislations if elected.Mr Kioko lamented that the current senator has not been liaising with the County Assembly but has instead been fighting the governor.He likened the role of a senator to a supervisor in a company who has to understand the role and function of the company to lead the workers. The problem we have in Machakos is that the senator does not understand his role. He has opposed the manifesto of the current governor and caused the loss of jobs for hundreds of our youths by going to court to oppose the creation of the New Machakos City, said Mr Kioko who is vying on a Maendeleo Chap Chap Party ticket.He questioned the credentials of Mr Muthama and wants his background probed. email print email print

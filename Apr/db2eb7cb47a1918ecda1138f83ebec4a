A 63-year-old records management officer, Shadrack Adede, has joined the growing list of Kenya’s latest millionaires after bagging Sh1 million during Lotto’s second Easter Power draw held at the weekend. The feat made Adede Lotto’s 148th millionaire and the ninth Supa Sunday winner. The Nairobi County resident, who originally hails from Kisumu County where he was born, was ecstatic to learn of the big, life-changing win. Adede said it was not necessarily the win he was aiming for, but the passion for the raffle as he regularly places a wager at Lotto. He, however, concedes that in as much as he is elated at the fortune, his biggest dreams lies in raking in the Sh100 million New Year’s jackpot prize.   Wario has quashed talk of SuperSport’s possible return to the Kenyan market.

CONAKRYPiles of rubbish and broken-down cars are being removed from the rundown streets of Conakry, and disgruntled hawkers on the main avenues have been told to close their stalls and move on."We've been working night and day," says truck driver Mamadouba Soumah, who was requisitioned for the clean up.On ministerial orders, in Soumah's words, the capital of dirt-poor Guinea has been scrubbed and primped to transform it into "the pearl of the world's lagoons."The reason for the transformation has nothing to do with a visit by a foreign VIP or a major sporting event, but with literature.Conakry is being enshrined as World Book Capital for the next 12 months.The honour propels the poverty-stricken, little-known city to the ranks of cultural titans such as Madrid, New Delhi, Montreal, Turin and Amsterdam all previous holders of the title since its inauguration in 2001.As World Book Capital, a city gets the chance to showcase established and emerging literary talent, both from home and abroad, and to lure major book publishers.It is also a golden opportunity for promoting talent in other areas theatre, music and cinema.A person walks past posters promoting the "Conakry - 2017 World book capital" event organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in Conakry on April 23, 2017.

Few people read books outside those required by school curricula."If you are looking for some safe place to stash your money in Guinea, you hide it in a book. No-one around here will steal it," a history teacher quipped. email print email print

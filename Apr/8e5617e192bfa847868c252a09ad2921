Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party leader Raila Odinga’s Saturday tour of Lamu has been abruptly cancelled. The tour was aimed at solidifying support for ODM and Nasa in the county. Mr Odinga was to meet ODM delegates, opinion leaders and party supporters from various parts of the county before his public address at Mkunguni Square. Mr Rishad Amana, an ODM politician, confirmed the cancellation saying the party leader will concentrate on solving ODM nomination issues in various counties before making his trip to Lamu. Earlier in Friday, Lamu ODM coordinator Zahara Shee had confirmed the tour but later said it had been postponed. NOMINATIONS “It is true. Mr Odinga is not coming on Saturday due to unavoidable circumstances more especially concerning issues to do with party nominations,” said Mrs Shee. Mr Odinga’s tour was also a comeback campaign for the party after ODM deputy party leader and Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho led a rally in Mpeketoni last month which was disrupted. Lamu, which has previously been perceived as an opposition stronghold having voted mostly for ODM in the 2013 elections seems to have shifted allegiance. However, critics are still optimistic that Mr Odinga’s visit can solidify support for Nasa in a region where his party has enjoyed considerable support for some time.

It s every athlete s dream to compete at the IAAF World Championships and Kenyan-born Bahraini star Rose Chelimo is no exception.Chelimo, who jetted back Thursday from the Boston Marathon, where she finished second, announced that she will most certainly be in the Bahrain marathon team to this year s World Championships in London.Chelimo clocked a personal best two hours, 22 minutes and 51 seconds behind Kenya s winner Edna Kiplagat. I ran my race when I was in Boston and, having prepared well before the race, I found it easier to run and it was not hard as I had thought since it was my first time, said Chelimo, when she arrived at the Eldoret International Airport.The runner said she was going back to training since she will be in the Bahrain team. I m going back to Kapsabet, where I will train hard for the race since I want to win a gold medal, said the athlete, who was eighth in the Olympic Games last year.The fifth-placer in Boston, Gladys Cherono, who arrived together with Chelimo, said she did her best given that she was out of competition for more than a year and will be looking forward to a better season. The race was tough, though I had prepared well. I must say I was able to do my best, considering that I was out of competition for more than one year, said Cherono.Other ex-Kenya Bahraini athletes expected to be in the marathon team to the World Championships in August, are Olympic silver medallist Eunice Kirwa and Eunice Chumba, who was second in the Rotterdam Marathon. email print email print Randiek promised to cater for the interests of marginalised sports if elected.

Kenya Prison's hopes of reclaiming the Women's Africa Club Volleyball Championship were extinguished following their 3-1 loss to hosts Carthage in Tunisia on Friday. Prisons collapsed twice in the semi-final encounter, in the opening and fourth sets, and eventually lost 3-1 (21-25, 13-25-13, 26-24 and 25-16) against the host team at the Ksar Hellal Jemmal Hall in Monastir. David Lung'aho's charges were second best for longer spells in the match, save for the third set when they outlasted the North Africans. Carthage thus progress to the final where they are set to play the winner of the all-Egyptian contest between defending champions Al Ahly and Al Shams. Prisons will play the loser in the third place play-off. Earlier on at the same, Kenya Pipeline brushed aside hosts Sfaxien 3-0 (25-11, 25-21, 25-21) in a position five-eight classification match at the Women's Africa Club Championship in Tunisia. The result provided the best possible comeback for the Kenyan champions, coming hours after suffering a heartbreaking 3-2 (13-25, 28-26, 25-19, 23-25 and 15-13) loss in a five-set thriller, at the hands of arch-rivals Kenya Prisons in the quarter-finals on Thursday evening. Following the result against the Tunisian club, Japheth Munala's Pipeline have now enhanced their chances of finishing fifth in the 17-team competition.   The result provided the best possible comeback for the Kenyan champions.

Kenyans, and mostly university students, will be heartened to learn that the government plans to enforce 24-hour surveillance in the institutions of higher learning to enhance security and particularly dismantle terror cartels that have found a foothold on the campuses. Coming about two years after the ghastly Garissa University College Al-Shabaab attack that left 148 students dead, the plan by the Internal Security ministry is to beef up security at the universities, which have become soft targets for terror attacks as well as hotbeds for radicalisation by religious extremists. However, the government needs to be cautious in deploying police in universities. In particular, it must ensure that the security arrangements do not interfere with the rights of the students to associate, move and discuss ideas freely; for universities are the epicentres of free debate and critical thinking. The objective is to exterminate terror gangs and extremists and not to intimidate and instill fear in the learning community. It would be expedient to make police presence at the institutions as covert as possible to protect the sanctity of the scholarly environment. All efforts to curtail or rein in terrorists must be encouraged. However, this must be executed with prudence so that it does not end up being counterproductive.

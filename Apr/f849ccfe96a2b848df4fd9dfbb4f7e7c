KENYA’S VISIONARY ACTOR, theatre director Titi Wainaina and his theatrical group Arts and Culture Africa are known for their thematic productions that have portrayed various issues affecting our day to day lives. The group has showcased deep awareness of human rights, love, peace and unity amongst Kenyans. With the forthcoming inauguration of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), Titi’s group feels indebted to honour the sons and daughters who spared nothing to bring our country where it is in terms of infrastructural prowess. The group has selected A Kenyan Journey by Pheroze Nowrojee as a befitting vehicle to honor those who sacrificed their lives in the process of building our railway. Pheroze we all know is Kenya’s renowned human rights lawyer, poet, feature writer and the foremost champion of Asian African Heritage Trust. Titi is fascinated by Pheroze’s book and the story of Indian rail workers. He has plans to present an animated version of the story of Indian “coolies” at the inauguration of the SGR and later as a play in Nairobi and Mombasa. The group also has plans to travel across the borders with this extravaganza that will feature Kenyan actors and showmen from Asian, African and European communities living here. The production team of A Kenyan Journey has plans to visit historic places of worship for the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities in Kenya that were directly involved in the railway construction, interview the curators and finally dramatise their narratives. The group has also organised a Peace Train running between Malaba and Mombasa with the artists entertaining and wishing Kenyans a peaceful election process. Titi Wainaina, his creative mates Mwamule Deche, Lolani Kalu and the entire production team of A Kenyan Journey deserve hearty support from all peace loving people for this creative venture set to salute railway pioneers. Have a peaceful Labour Day.

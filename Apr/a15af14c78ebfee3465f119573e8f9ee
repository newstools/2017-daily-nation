After suffering their first league defeat at the hands of KCB on Wednesday, Eldoret-based GFE 105 are out to bounce back when they take on Bidco United on Saturday at Kipchoge Keino Stadium. The National Super League (NSL) leaders’ unbeaten record run ended when they were edged out 1-0 by Leonard Saleh’s charges at home. But coach Joshua Obara, who watched his side miss chances including Hezron Ochieng’s second half penalty, is optimistic his boys will perform better against Bidco in their 3pm kick off encounter. Wazito FC have a tough assignment on Sunday when they take on Ushuru at Camp Toyoyo. Wazito, who were awarded three points without kicking a ball on Monday away at the expense of hosts Bidco United, need to win to keep their promotion hopes alive. Their tie was called off for lack of an ambulance to provide the prerequisite medical facility. Ushuru, who are fifth after they lost 3-1 to Modern Coast Rangers at Thika Stadium last weekend, will be out to return to winning ways. Third-placed Rangers will host Administration Police KPA Mbaraki Sports Club tomorrow in a match they must win to keep to remain focused.

ARUSHAThe East African Grain Council (EAGC) has expressed its concern over the decision by some countries to ban the exportation of grain when the region is grappling with severe drought.The regional private sector organisation has also advised the East African member states to find a solution to the drought that was getting out of hand in some of the countries. LIFT BANMr Gerald Makau Masila, council s Executive Director, revealed this on Sunday, saying the ongoing drought had dealt huge blows to some countries. He called for renewed efforts of coping with the disaster other than imposing a ban on grain exportation. He said it was high time the EAC member states lifted ban on food exportation as it would not in any way have effects on food security if well managed. This can be achievable if the resources around us are well managed, he insisted. SOLUTIONSMr Christopher Bazivamo, EAC s Deputy Secretary General in charge of Productive and Social Sectors said the community had already brought together agricultural experts and researchers to look for solutions on the drought. According to the EAGC, currently, the eastern Africa region is experiencing a scarcity of rainfall and drought conditions leading to a shortage of food grains. email print email print

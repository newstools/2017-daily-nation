Kenya’s World Boxing Council female super bantamweight world champion, Fatuma Zarika has confirmed she will face Matshidiso Mokebisi of  South African in an eight rounds non-title fight at Nairobi’s Carnivore on April 29. Zarika said that the contest will be part of her preparations for the defence of her belt against a Jamaican, Alicia Ashley, whom she dethroned last October 1, in Michigan, USA by a split point decision. Zarika also said that she was expecting her American promoter, Ejay Mathew, to come to Nairobi as he was the one to promote the event in Kenya’s capital city. “I will leave for America soon after the Nairobi fight to fine tune for the defence of my title against Ashley,” Zarika said. “I expect to get a better deal for the title fight under Mathew, whom I trust." “The man who promoted the fight that I challenged Ashley last year did not pay me a penny even though my purse was $3,500 (Sh360,500).” When asked the name of her first promoter, she said: “I do not know his name." “I was connected to him by a Mexican friend with whom I was staying with in Florida. I had been introduced to the Mexican girl by my former coach, Julius Odhiambo, a couple of years ago.” Ashley has been given approval to challenge Zarika for the title within 90 days.

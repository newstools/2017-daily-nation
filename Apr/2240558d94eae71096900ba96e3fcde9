Muthaiga Golf Club are the new Tannahill Shield golf championship kings.Skippered by former international Kumar Dhall, Muthaiga saved the best for last, hauling the fourth and final round of 14 points to reclaim the title they last won in 2012 by three points at Royal Nairobi Golf Club.Muthaiga were flawless against Railway, winning all their four matches 8-0 before losing only one match against Mombasa for their 6-2 victory.That saw Muthaiga collect 14 points for their total tally of 47 points as they dethroned hosts Royal Nairobi Golf Club who have won the title for three consecutive years.Royal had to settle second after they managed nine points from the final round for their tally of 44 with Vet Lab, who returned nine points for total 38, came in third. Sigona emerged fourth with 34, two points better than fifth-placed Karen.What perhaps punctured holes into Royal s dream of lifting their fourth consecutive title, were Vet Lab, who forced a 4-4 draw against them what with Limuru claiming three vital points from them in their 5-3 win.There were anxious moment when Muthaiga made it to the club house first with 14 points and had to wait for several minutes for Royal, who led into the final round, to check in. A lot of practice as a team, getting the players to talk to each other and motivation are what did the trick this time around, said Dhall, whose team finished joint-fourth with Sigona last year. We experimented different pairings to come up with the finest. Dhall explained that all their pairs did exemplary well what with the chemist among them working out throughout the three days for championships that marked its 93rd edition this year.Muthaiga team manager Nelson Mu noted that the decision to bring in fresh and young legs in the likes of juniors Kavit Bhakoo and Kibugu Mutahi, who partnered with Anthony Irungu and veteran Evans Vitisia respectively, changed their fortunes in the third round. That is why we slashed Royals lead to two points going into the final round before victory, said Mudanyi. We knew who we were to field and substitute and it worked magic hence we need to have more juniors in the team. Royal s captain Charles Omondi was graceful in defeat and congratulated Muthaiga for their victory, promising to recapture the title next year. Defending it three consecutive times wasn t easy and that is why teams had prepared well for us, said Omondi adding that the event showed great improvement after Western drew with Royal besides picking points from other teams.Against Railway, Mutahi/Vitisia beat Joseph Kehara/Kash Padam 5-4 after leading 3 up at the turn while Bhakoo/Irungu rallied from one down at the turn to beat Paul Orawo/Edward Murungi 3-2.

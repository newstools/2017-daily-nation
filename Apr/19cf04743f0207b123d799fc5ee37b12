The number of fishermen in Lamu East have reduced by half after fishing at night was banned six year ago. About 6000 locals depend on fishing for survival. It has however been established that since the ban was imposed in 2011, about 50 per cent of the fishermen have left the venture following huge losses. The ban was introduced following a spate of Al-Shabaab terror attacks where tourists and fishermen were often kidnapped and taken hostage. The hardest hit were areas along the Lamu-Somalia border including Kiunga, Ishakani, Kiwayu and Mkokoni. Addressing journalists on Thursday, Lamu East MP Athman Sharif expressed concern over the state of the fishing industry which he said might collapse if the ban is not lifted. Last week, Linda Boni Security Operation deputy director Ngalia Ndaya announced that talks had already been initiated and that the ban would be lifted soon. Mr Sharif questioned why the ban was still on yet the government had indicated security in the county had been restored. “I understand our plea has been accepted but there are a few security bosses here in Lamu who refuse to let the ban lifted. We won’t accept that,” said Mr Sharif. Mr Mohamed Omar who has been a fisherman in Kiunga for the past 15 years said over 3000 of his colleague have quit following the ban. He urged the government to break its silence on the ban saying it has led to increased poverty. Mr Omar also complained of harassment of fishermen by security officers whom he accused of demanding to see their national identity cards during the day before going to fish. “We are tired and that’s why most of us have quit the trade until the government lifts the ban,” said Mr Omar.   Fishermen in Lamu can now breathe easy after the national government announced plans to review a night fishing ban that has been in place in Kiunga, Lamu East Sub-County, for the past five years.

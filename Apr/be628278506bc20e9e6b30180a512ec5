Police arrested 63 people across the country for various electoral and penal code offences between April 13 and 27. The National Police Service said on Friday that two people were killed in Nairobi and that a total of 24 cases were recorded in different counties during the period, which saw different political parties conduct their primaries in preparation for the August 8 General Election. “Out of the two who were killed, one had been subjected to mob injustice after being accused of pick-pocketing during the Nasa Rally,” National Police Service Spokesperson George Kinoti said. The Nasa rally was held on Thursday at Uhuru Park where the coalition's principals were announcing the presidential flag-bearer. The other death, Mr Kinoti said, was reported after a confrontation between two rival aspirants along Juja Road. The deceased was stabbed as he displayed posters for a candidate. “As the country moves to the other phases in the electoral calendar, the NPS urges members of the public to continue maintaining peace,” Mr Kinoti said, as he appealed to all political party contestants to voice their grievances through the established respective party channels. He assured all Kenyans of the service’s commitment to providing Kenyans with a peaceful and secure environment to exercise their democratic rights of electing their leaders.

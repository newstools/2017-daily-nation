A manhunt continues for a suspected gun thief in Wisconsin, US, who mailed a threatening manifesto to President Donald Trump, The New York Times reports. Joseph A. Jakubowski, 32, is wanted in connection with a burglary on April 4 at a local gun store in which several firearms were stolen, the paper’s website reports. Local authorities in Wisconsin said Jakubowski has issues with all types of authority and had threatened to use weapons against government officials and an unidentified school. The officials said the manifesto Jakubowski sent to Trump is “anti-government and also anti-religious” and urges people to rise up and start a revolution, the Times reports. The FBI is seeking the public’s help to find Jakubowski and has placed a $10,000 bounty on his head. ***White House combats infighting among Trump’s advisers All is not well, apparently, with the team that advises Trump, US media report.

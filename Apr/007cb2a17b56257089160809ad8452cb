WITH RISING CASES of cancer, consumers are becoming cautious about products they use. The personal care industry has plenty of unsafe ingredients in every day use products. These are chemicals used to create attractive formulations of lotions, creams, hand sanitisers, anti antiperspirants and so forth. Chemical preservatives are used to increase the shelf life of these products. Some are included to make sure that the products are stable, easy to spread, sweet smelling and quickly absorbed. These chemicals can cause an overload in the system. Here is a quick guide to help you discover whether you have been affected by chemical overload. Allergic reactions: If you find yourself itching or reacting adversely to a product by tearing and developing a rash, this could mean that the product has chemicals that do not agree with your skin. The best thing to do is to give your skin a break from all chemical based products. If the problem persists, seek medical treatment. Changes in the colour of your skin: If you find that your skin is becoming lighter and you had no intention of bleaching or altering your natural complexion tone, chances are that your skin is reacting to a chemical ingredient in your products. It is always best to stop using the product in a bid to allow your skin to return to normal. Skin Detoxification If you find that your skin is completely sensitive to all forms of chemicals in products, you could make a switch to natural oils. These oils often moisturise and soften the skin. The gentlest oil for sensitive skin is almond. Other useful oils to give your skin a break from chemicals are coconut, olive, baobab seed, avocado and other plant based organic oils.

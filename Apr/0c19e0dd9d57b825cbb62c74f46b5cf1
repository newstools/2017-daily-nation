One person is feared dead and scores injured after supporters of Funyula MP Paul Otuoma and Busia Governor Sosepeter Ojamoong clashed in Funyula. Violence broke out moments before Dr Otuoma arrived at Funyula market, where he was scheduled to address a rally. PRIMARIES Mr Otuoma had called the rally ahead of Orange Democratic Movement primaries slated for Saturday.   The nominations have since been pushed to April 14 for Bungoma, Busia and Machakos. The mobs attacked each other with rocks, with women and children being caught up in the crossfire.   Hell broke loose when Mr Ojamoong's supporters stormed the venue as leaders allied to Dr Otuoma were addressing the public. Dr Otuoma's sympathisers engaged their opponents in a stone throwing battle and caught of them, whom they gave thorough beating.   However, Samia Police boss Mary Kiarie said she was not aware of those injured during the rally. "I have not received any report regarding the allegations," Ms Kiarie said. Addressing the gathering on arrival, Dr Otuoma condemned acts of violence adding that no amount of intimidation would stop him from clinching the party ticket.   "I am ready for this course and Iâ€™m sure of victory. This is not just a contest between me and Ojamoong' but a battle to save Busia and it's people," Dr Otuoma said. Dr Otuoma and Mr Ojamoong are locked in a do-or-die battle for the Orange party's ticket. Mr Ojamoong, through the County Director of Communications, said they were yet to establish whether those who stormed Dr Otuoma's rally were his supporters. "We are following up the claims and will give a comprehensive brief on the same after establishing our facts from the ground," he said.

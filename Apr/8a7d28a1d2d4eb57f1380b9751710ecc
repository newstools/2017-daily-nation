Police are hunting down six people suspected to be involved in a botched bank robbery in Eldoret town. Two men have so far been arrested and three guns found in one of the cars used by the suspects on Friday. The vehicle had a fake number plate. Police said the gang went to Supreme Equity bank located at Poa Place and snatched two loaded AK47 rifles from police officers manning the premise and stormed inside. However, Mr Samuel Mutunga, Eldoret West police boss, said the mission was aborted after the gangsters got wind that police were already dispatched to arrest them. "I was informed of the robbery by the two Administration Police officers whose guns were snatched and immediately sent a signal to other officers to assemble at the scene but they were clever not to proceed with their scheme but to run," Mr Mutunga told the Nation. They drove off in three saloon cars suspected to have been stolen. The police gave chase and arrested them at Cheptiret trading centre on the Eldoret-Nakuru highway. The suspects are being held at Central police station as investigations continue.

Wiper secretary-general Hassan Omar Hassan has been described by his Jubilee rival for the Mombasa governor’s seat as inexperienced to lead the county, barely a day after he unveiled his manifesto. Jubilee Party’s Suleiman Shahbal on Thursday hit back at senator Hassan who had claimed that he (Shahbal) was not qualified for the post. The senator claimed that Mr Shahbal, a banker, was only suitable to be the governor of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). “I am glad that Omar recognises my experience in banking and that I have the capacity to be the CBK governor. But the problem with him is that he has never run a business in his life,” he said. “What he knows is activism after working with human rights groups. The work of Mombasa Governor needs somebody like me who has vast knowledge in how institutions operate,” he said. Mr Shahbal accused the senator being “quiet” even as Governor Hassan Joho was “overseeing” plunder of public resources at the county. REMAIN RELEVANT “Where was Omar for close to four years when he was supposed to provide oversight at the county?” he posed. He spoke at the Coast International College, Shanzu, at the close of a three-day training for 179 aspirants for MCA and woman rep posts. Mr Shahbal said the training was intended to equip aspirants with skills that will enable them run the county once elected. His running mate Anania Mwaboza said they had decided to train all the aspirants so that even those who will be dropped at the nominations remain relevant in the running of the county. “One of the major challenges facing the current crop of MCAs is that they are not well versed in law making. We don’t want this to happen when we take over leadership of Mombasa County, the reason we have invested in this training,” he said.   Mr Hassan says over taxation of Mombasa residents has impoverished them.

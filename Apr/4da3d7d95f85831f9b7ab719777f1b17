Isiolo Senator Mohammed Kuti’s gubernatorial candidature has received a boost after the Somali vowed to rally behind him. Somali council of elders agreed to back Dr Kuti and proposed Dr Abdi Ibrahim Issa to be his running mate. In a meeting with Somali youths in Isiolo Town Thursday, Dr Issa disclosed that the community’s decision to endorse Senator Kuti was reached since other gubernatorial aspirants in the region had already picked their running mate’s from other communities. The Senator will battle it out with the incumbent Governor Godana Doyo, Mr Abdul Bahari, who has been the Tana Athi River Development Authority (Tarda) chairman, Adan Kabelo (ODM), Hussein Golicha (Kanu), deputy governor Mohammed Guleid (CCM) and Isiolo businessman of Indian origin Anwar Kassam. Governor Doyo, Senator Kuti and Mr Bahari are set to compete in the Jubilee party nominations on April 21. RUNNING MATES “Already, the governor, Mr Kabelo and Mr Golicha have picked their running mates from the Turkana community, which is among the top three vote baskets in Isiolo County,” said Dr Issa. On the other hand, the Tarda chairman has settled for Mr Domiziano Maingi, a businessman from the Meru community in Isiolo as his deputy. The deputy governor and Mr Kassam are yet to decide on their running mates. Dr Issa, who is a doctor based in the UK, said all the 11 Somali clans are in support of the Senator Kuti’s gubernatorial candidature. “The community has 15,000 voters and we are going to rally all of them to support and elect Dr Kuti,” he added.

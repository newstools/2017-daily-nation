Congestion and traffic jams cost Kenya Sh37 billion annually and now a major conference has been lined up in Nairobi to look at ways of developing a better transport system. The conference will be addressed by experts in the transport sectors from Africa, among them former Tanzanian deputy minister Athuman Mfutakamba and Nairobi Metropolitan Area Transport Authority CEO James Ng’ang’a. The conference, called "Driving towards Sustainable Urban Transport Systems in Africa", will be held from April 24-25. According to the organisers, Magenta Global Pte Ltd, rapid urbanisation, increasing motorisation and inefficient vehicles lead to poor air quality, rising number of fatal accidents and poor accessibility. “Along with infrastructure upgrades, bus, rail, rapid transit systems and non-motorised transport interventions and investments are required as 83 per cent of all commuter trips in urban areas such as Nairobi involves walking,” said the organisers. They added: “The Urban Transport Africa Summit will provide a cohesive platform for all stakeholders to discuss and deliberate on issues to create sustainable and inclusive urban transport systems in Africa.”

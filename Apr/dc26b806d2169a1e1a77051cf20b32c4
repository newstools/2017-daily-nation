MOSCOW Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday met US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after complaining of worsening ties with Donald Trump s administration as the two sides spar over Syria.Mr Putin received Tillerson at the Kremlin along with Russia s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the top diplomats held several hours of talks dominated by the fallout of an alleged chemical attack in Syria.Despite initial hopes in Moscow of better ties with the US under Trump, the two powers have descended into a furious war of words over the incident and a retaliatory US missile strike against the forces of Moscow s ally Bashar al-Assad last week. Russia has slammed Washington s attack on a Syrian airbase and, as Mr Tillerson met Mr Lavrov, Putin admitted that relations between Washington and Moscow have worsened in the three months that Trump has been in office. COMMON OBJECTIVES At the start of his meeting with Mr Lavrov, Mr Tillerson said he wanted to clarify areas of common objectives, areas of common interest even where our tactical approaches may be different and further clarify areas of sharp difference. During his visit the first to Moscow by a senior Trump administration official Mr Tillerson was expected to challenge Russia to distance itself from Assad and his Iranian backers, an idea that the Kremlin dismissed as absurd .Lavrov told Tillerson Moscow was hoping to understand Washington s real intentions and warned that the Kremlin considered it fundamentally important to prevent more unlawful US strikes against its ally Syria. UN RESOLUTIONIn a further indication of the stark differences, Russia also slammed as unacceptable a proposed UN resolution put forward by the US, Britain and France on the alleged chemical attack, and said it would veto it in its current form at a vote expected later Wednesday. The Western-backed resolution which was slightly revised from a proposal presented last week demands that the Syrian government cooperate with an investigation into the alleged attack. As tempers rose ahead of Tillerson s visit, US officials suggested Russian forces may have colluded in the latest atrocity blamed on Assad s regime that left 87 civilians dead including children in the town of Khan Sheikhun. email print email print President-elect says it is evidence of political witch hunt to delegitimise November victory.

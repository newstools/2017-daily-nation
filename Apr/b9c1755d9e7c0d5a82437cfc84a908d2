A criminal case against Uasin Gishu Senator Isaac Melly is likely to continue after the University of Eldoret failed to confirm a request for an out of court settlement. The university did not send a representative to court to confirm an agreement between the two parties. Last year, Mr Melly through his lawyer, Ochang Ajigo, told a Nakuru court that he had reached an agreement with the institution to settle the matter out of court. The prosecution however said they were yet to get an official communication from the university regarding the the consent. Appearing before principal magistrate Joe Omido, the prosecution led by Sally Kosgei said they were ready to proceed with the case should the university fail to give a nod on the out of court settlement. “The University has not sent any representative to confirm to the court of the agreement and so we are willing to prosecute the case,” said Ms Kosgei. Mr Melly, along with student leader Wesley Kogo, and politician Jonathan Bii have denied charges of leading demonstrators who caused damage at the university during a protest in 2015. The protesters were demanding the removal of the university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Teresia Akenga, over claims of tribalism and nepotism in recruitment. Principal magistrate Omido adjourned the matter to August 23.   Legislator accuses University of Eldoret Vice-Chancellor of nepotism.

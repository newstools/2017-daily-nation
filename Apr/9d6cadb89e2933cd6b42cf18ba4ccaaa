Most of the 140 students who scored an A grade in last year’s Form Four exams were admitted to the University of Nairobi to study medicine. The placement results released on Wednesday show that 88,626 students have been admitted to public and private universities this year. Half the freshmen are women. The results were released at Daystar by Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service chief executive John Muraguri. He disclosed that students who scored good grades such as B plain and above missed their courses of choice since they went for courses that they did not qualify for when clustered. “Those who scored C+ grade got their degree choices,” said Mr Muraguri. PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES Interestingly, no single candidate scored an A grade in English. Only 28 students scored an A- out 522,870 candidates who sat the examination while 284,000 students scored D- and below in Mathematics making it hard for them to get required cluster points. He said that 71,089 students have been placed in public universities while 17,368 students will join private universities. Mr Muraguri said more than 70 technical colleges have been allocated 28,261 students against a capacity of 51,000 students. “All government sponsored students in public or private universities pay tuition fee of Sh16,000 a year and other administrative charges which on average amount to Sh30,000. University of Nairobi will admit 5,955 students, Kenyatta University will admit 5,741, Moi University (5,190), Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology will get 4,994 while Masinde Muliro University has been allocated 3,597. DEGREE COURSES Turkana University College, which was set up this year, has been allocated 120 students, Alupe University College will get 192 while Garissa University College will get 441 students. Garissa’s capacity is 700 students. Mr Muraguri said that 194 students who scored C+ and above applied for diploma instead of degree courses. Candidates who sat their examination as far back as 1993 also applied but priority was given to candidates who sat their examinations last year. Last year, a total of 86,142 were admitted to universities with 12,000 joining private universities while 12,038 joined colleges. In 2014, 67,790 students joined university while 11,524 joined colleges. Students wishing to transfer to other universities will be given one month from May 15 to do so. GET LOANS Higher Education Loans Board chief operating officer Geoffrey Monari said the students would only get their loans from July and each would be required to have a smart card first. “Some of the students will join universities in May but our financial year will start in July and that means that they can only get from September,” said Mr Monari. Private universities welcomed the allocation of more students to them. Vice-chancellors forum chairman Francis Aduol said the list would enable universities to prepare.

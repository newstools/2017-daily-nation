A Nyahururu court has ordered that two suspects who were arrested in connection with last month’s killing of Laikipia ranch owner Tristan Voorspuy to be arraigned in court within 24 hours. The two, Josphat Ng'ethe Ndungu and Mereri Tetekur were arrested on Tuesday last week after they were tracked down by detectives at Ol Moran market in Laikipia West sub-county, where they were with other livestock traders. Nyahururu Resident magistrate Victoria Ochanda ordered that the two be produced in Nanyuki High Court after quashing an application by the prosecution to hold the duo for two more weeks to complete investigations. The two had been locked up at Rumuruti police Station after some of the deceased’s personal items were recovered from them. Mr Voorspuy’s wallet and phone were stolen after he was shot on March 5, while riding on a horse at his Sosian ranch, which had been invaded by pastoralists. A herdsman Samson Lokayi and Laikipia North lawmaker Mathew Lemprukel had been arrested in connection with the murder. Mr Lokayi pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being detained at Nanyuki Prison until May 10, when his bail application will be determined. However the case against Mr Lemprukel was dismissed by a Nanyuki court on Monday after the prosecution told the court that it had not managed to gather enough evidence to implicate the MP. According to police the two suspects will be arraigned in court on Wednesday.   Prosecutors say they are not ready as court relaxes conditions imposed on Mathew Lempurkel.

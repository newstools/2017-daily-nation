A Kenya Police Reservist was shot and seriously injured by raiders at Sosian Ranch, hours after a ranch owner was attacked. The officer was shot while attempting to engage armed bandits who had made away with over 100 heads of cattle from the neighbouring Ol Maisor Ranch in Laikipia North. “The officer who was shot was among KPR officers who had been called to reinforce other security officers to engage the herders who had made away with over 100 heads of cattle at our ranch,” Mr Mohamed Abkur, Ol Maisor head of security, said. LAYING AMBUSH The incident follows the shooting of Italian conservationist and owner of Gallmann Africa Conservancy, Kuki Gallmann, in Laikipia West. Mrs Gallmann was shot in the stomach while walking around in her ranch. She is receiving treatment at a hospital in Nairobi.

"As we are talking now a fierce gun fight is still ongoing between KDF officers and the illegal herders. "The officers have however managed to keep hold of the livestock and are now tackling the attackers," Mr Abkur told the Nation on phone. VOORSPUY KILLED This is not the first time misfortune has visited Sosian Ranch. In March this year Tristan Voorspuy, the co-owner of the property, was shot dead by raiders when he went to the site where cottages were burnt by herders.

There’s quite some buzz around Kenyan rugby with the sevens team launching its defence of the Singapore Sevens and the secondary schools 15-a-side finals also being played today in Nairobi. On Wednesday, former England World Cup-winning prop Jason Leonard visited Nairobi to launch grassroots rugby activities while the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) landed a fresh Sh5 million sponsorship for its 15s Test Match programme. While giving tips to young players from Kibera, Leonard implored the KRU to focus on the development of 15s rugby, rather than lay unnecessarily too much emphasis on the abridged seven-a-side game. Resources must be dedicated to Kakamega High School and Laiser Hill Academy who clash in today’s schools finals, alongside other promising schools as herein lies the future of Kenyan rugby. Qualification to the World Cup will spur an unprecedented development of the 15s game, and that should be the minimum target for the KRU as we prepare to have a go at making it to the 2019 World Cup finals in Japan.

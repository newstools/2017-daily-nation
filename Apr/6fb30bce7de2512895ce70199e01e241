LOS ANGELESRussell Westbrook edged closer to NBA immortality with his 40th triple-double of the season on Sunday as LeBron James dug deep to help Cleveland clinch a double-overtime thriller against Indiana.Westbrook scored 40 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and provided 10 assists as the Oklahoma City Thunder fell to a 113-101 home loss against the Charlotte Hornets.The Thunder guard is now one triple-double away from tying Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson's single-season record of 41, set in 1961-62 for the Cincinnati Royals.With six games left in the regular season, Westbrook can match the record when the Thunder host the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday.Westbrook however was more focused on the Thunder's defeat than the latest chapter in his remarkable season.Asked for his thoughts about the possibility of tying Robertson's long-standing mark on Tuesday, Westbrook replied: "We gotta win. That's my thoughts.""We were just making bad mistakes, bad decisions," Westbrook said after a game that saw the Thunder hand over 24 turnovers. "Starting with myself, we have to take better care of the ball."Oklahoma City now lie in sixth place in the Western Conference standings at 43-33.In Cleveland, the Cavaliers looked to 2016 NBA Finals MVP James once again to secure a pulsating 135-130 win over the Pacers in double-overtime.James finished with 41 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists for his 11th triple-double of the season and the 53rd of his career in a crucial win for the Cavaliers.Pacers star Paul George led the scoring with 43 points including 19 in the two periods of overtime, adding nine rebounds and nine assists.SHOUTING MATCH But James lost his cool in an on-court shouting match with team-mate Tristan Thompson, the two trading barbs over a blown coverage."I had good intentions but I was a little bit too demonstrative at that point in the game," James said. "I can't show up my teammates, that's for sure, especially Double T (Thompson) worked hard for our team, he's a big-time player for our team so I had good intentions of what I wanted to happen, but the way it came out was ... it didn't look good on TV."The Cavs moved to 49-27 to stay a half-game behind the Boston Celtics, who are 50-27. The Pacers meanwhile fell to 37-40, leaving them in a tie for eighth place with the Miami Heat.Cleveland's win sets the stage perfectly for what promises to be a titanic battle with Boston on Wednesday.The Celtics brought up their 50th win of the season, downing the New York Knicks 110-94, to maintain their grip on first place."A couple of years ago I would have thought that would be something we would have to build for a while for," admitted coach Brad Stevens, now in his fourth year with the rebuilding Celtics."Obviously we have been lucky to strike on a couple of guys. Everyone has a like mind, trying to compete every night. We look forward to the playoffs, then we will look back to what we have accomplished this season."Stevens has overseen a steady rebuilding job in Boston, who finished 25-57 in his first season in charge in 2013-2014.Sunday's blowout meant Stevens could rest his starters in the fourth quarter, including late-game powerhouse Isaiah Thomas.Thomas led the Celtics with 19 points and six assists in just 23 minutes on the floor."I think we're in pretty good shape from a legs standpoint," Stevens said. "There may be a point or two in the next 10 days where we sit guys a little more, but right now we're focused on playing good basketball."Back in the Western Conference, Stephen Curry scored 42 points as the leading Golden State Warriors moved to within three wins of clinching the best record in the league.The Dubs thrashed the Washington Wizards 139-115 to improve to 63-14. email print email print Joho, Orengo and Nyong o whisked away by bodyguards after chaos starts. #ElectionsKE Last week, Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita dismissed a case challenging the tender award to KPMG.

Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung’aro says the opposition will not win any votes at the Coast as its leaders failed to address land issues when they were in government. The Jubilee point-man in the region said Nasa leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka failed to solve land issues during the Grand Coalition government. Mr Mung’aro said it was only when Jubilee came to power that more than 100,000 Coast squatters got title deeds. He also issued a 30-day ultimatum to Governor Amason Kingi to produce records on the revenue collected for past financial years. He said a senior county officer blocked the assembly from accessing the revenue records in 2016 by moving to court once the report was requested in a bid to hold them accountable. TAXES “If he fails to honour our call, I will be forced to go round the county together with fellow legislators and ask residents to demonstrate against paying taxes until the records are made public,” he said. Mr Mung’aro wants Governor Kingi to account for the expenditure of the revenue collected since residents have been deprived of crucial development. “Every month, the boda boda operators are taxed Sh300 and it is unfortunate that some county officers moved to court to block the county assembly from knowing the amount of revenue collected,” he said. Mr Mung’aro has joined forces with Kilifi Deputy Governor Kenneth Kamto, who is his running mate, to unseat Governor Kingi of ODM during the August elections. The gubernatorial hopeful also challenged Governor Kingi to show his development records rather than telling the public that he is a staunch ODM leader. He also told Mr Kingi to stop politicising development matters in the county and instead tell people about his development record and his plans for Kilifi.   Mr Mung’aro says that despite the region having many palm trees it remains poor.

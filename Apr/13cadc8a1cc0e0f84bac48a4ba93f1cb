At least a 100 people have been treated for malaria at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in the past one month, raising fears of an outbreak of the disease in the region. According to hospital Chief Executive Officer Wilson Aruasa, the number of infections could rise in the next few weeks because of the rains falling in the region. “The ... rains provide a good breeding ground for mosquitoes and we want to urge the public to take all necessary measures to prevent and protect themselves from malaria,” he said on Monday. The Uasin Gishu County government confirmed the cases, saying measures were being put in place to ensure those infected are treated as soon as possible. PREVENTION MEASURES “Kapsokoi Ward in Turbo constituency is the worst hit with the disease and the numbers are set to increase in the next few weeks. This is according to the latest data the county government has received,” said Dr Evans Kiprotich, the Uasin Gishu County health director. Malaria cases are expected to rise in April, May and June due to the long-rains season. “So far, the county government of Uasin Gishu has taken necessary prevention measures to ensure that less people are affected by malaria and we are monitoring the issue closely so that we can tame it at its early stage,” Dr Kiprotich said on Tuesday. He said they had started distributing mosquito nets as well as intensifying awareness campaigns to ensure that locals understand prevention tactics. Dr Kiprotich added: “It is not an outbreak or epidemic because malaria disease is under control in the county.”   More than 3,700 people are reported to have died from the mosquito-borne disease since 2016

Two people died Monday night when a Machakos County ambulance collided with a matatu in Kathome on the Machakos-Nairobi road. Five others were taken to hospital with serious injuries. The ambulance was rushing a sick child from Machakos to Kenyatta National Hospital when the crash occurred at around 11pm. The driver of the ambulance and a six-month-old baby died on the spot while the mother and a paramedic were taken to Machakos Level 5 Hospital. Two other people who were in the ambulance and the driver of the matatu were also taken to the hospital. This is the second crash involving a Machakos County ambulance in recent months. On December 2 last year, two people died in a crash involving the countyâ€™s ambulance on the Mwala-Machakos road.

Congratulations! You have finally earned your first salary, it feels great doesn’t it? Before you go to the club though, and make it rain, here are a couple of factors to consider before you throw it all away and find yourself borrowing money for bus fare to work on Monday. 1.Note your benefits: Look through your pay slip, there are a couple of deductions. Some of you have been introduced to the hefty thing called PAYE – Pay As You Earn. Also ensure that your employer remits part of your pay to NSSF and NHIF for these are essential for your retirement plan and healthcare. Are you a member of a Sacco or saving scheme? If so, is the agreed amount you are saving deducted? Ensure that every single deduction on your pay slip is clear to you. If there is one that is unclear, talk to your HR manager and accountant. Also find out whether there is a wrongful debit. 2. Budget: Now that you know exactly how much you earn, this is the time to also draw a monthly budget on your cash flow. What are your immediate expenses? These include rent, bus fare, lunch and clothing. How much do you intend to save? 3. Clear your debt: The general rule of thumb is, don’t spend more than 30 per cent of your income to pay debt. You need to sit down and make a debt payment plan to pay back all you owe in a comfortable manner without straining too much of your income. This is especially essential if you took a HELB loan. The last thing you want is to walk into penalties. 4.Rainy Day account: Life happens, a close relative could pass away, an accident could happen, things that need money always crop up during the month. It is therefore reassuring to know that you have some money set aside to alleviate such setbacks. Save at least 10 per cent of your net income to take care of the rainy days. 5.Saving and Investment: If working in an organisation that doesn’t have a sacco, shop for one and join, it is the fastest form of saving and getting access to credit. Most saccos will allow you to borrow up to three times the amount saved at interest rates much lower than banks. You also earn annual dividends against the amount saved. You can start saving from as low as Sh1,000 a month and steadily increase your contribution. Saving is all about consistency, not volumes. You’d rather save Sh1,000 monthly, than Sh10,000 once in a year. Consistent saving helps build discipline and restraint. You’ll be grateful when you can afford that trip to Mombasa or Nanyuki in December just because you saved for it.

Kenya Pipeline stormed into the quarter-finals of the Women's Africa Club Volleyball Championship after a hard fought 3-0 (26-24, 25-23 and 25-16) win over Algeria's Sonatrach on Saturday. Pipeline, who are the Kenyan champions, had on Friday defeated Rwanda Patriotic Army (APR) 3-0 (26-24, 25-14 and 25-12) in their opening assignment of the annual competition. The win means the remaining group game against Cameroon's Bafia is a mere formality for Japheth Munala's charges. Sonatrach meanwhile, who defeated Bafia in their opening game, look favourites to join Pipeline in the last eight, ahead of their last group match against APR of Rwanda. The Kenyan champions, who are chasing a record equalling eighth continental title, will need a win against Bafia to preserve their 100 percent winning start to the competition and also maintain the momentum heading to the knock-out stages of the tournament. Pipeline who were donning their black regalia with shades of white, showed grit and determination to triumph, especially after trailing for long spells in the first two sets. Noel Murambi, captain Triza Atuka, Janet Wanja, Monica Biama and former French based star Esther Wangeci stood out with their blocks and attacks against formidable opposition, with Wanja instigating the attacks from the setters position.   Prisons coach David Lung’aho rued his team’s slow start to the game.

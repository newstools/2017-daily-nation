TOULONMike Ford quit as Toulon head coach on Tuesday after just six months in the post with Richard Cockerill taking over the turmoil-stricken French club until the end of the season.Ford left by mutual consent just two days after Toulon were beaten by Clermont in the Champions Cup. Former France international scrum-half Fabien Galthie has already been announced as Toulon's new coach for next season.Ford was the club's third coach in less than a year. He took over from Diego Dominguez in October, just a month after outspoken club president Mourad Boudjellal had brought the former England defence coach in as Toulon's backs coach.Dominguez was sacked following a poor start to the season that saw Toulon win only four of eight Top 14 matches and lose at home to Saracens in the European Champions Cup pool stages.But results did not improve under Ford if anything getting worse as they have won only six of 14 top flight encounters since the Englishman took over.And Sunday's Champions Cup exit at the hands of Top 14 rivals Clermont was the last straw for Boudjellal.Cockerill was brought into the Toulon backroom staff by Ford three months ago, just four days after the former England hooker had been sacked by Leicester Tigers.Cockerill, who is taking over at Edinburgh next season, will be assisted by Marc Dal Maso with Australia international Matt Giteau taking charge of the backs in a player-coach role.Giteau is to leave Toulon at the end of the season to continue his playing career in Japan.Dal Maso will be one of Galthie's assistants next season alongside Fabrice Landreau, Toulon announced last month.Galthie guided Stade Francais to the French title in 2007 and Montpellier to the Top 14 final in 2011.Ford was Bath head coach when they lost to Saracens in the 2015 English Premiership final.Cockerill guided Leicester to three English titles in five years from 2009 to 2013. email print email print The fall army worm, which is dispersed by wind, burrows inside maize stems and cobs making itInvestigators said Mr Nsale s other associates were in contact with wanted IS agents in and

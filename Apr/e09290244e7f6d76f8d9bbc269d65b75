LOS ANGELES LeBron James will not play in Cleveland's final regular season game against the Toronto Raptors, the team confirmed on Tuesday. James, who missed the Cavaliers' defeat to Miami on Monday after suffering a calf strain, will sit out Wednesday's clash with the Raptors, general manager David Griffin said. James' absence comes with Cleveland battling to regain the number one ranking in the Eastern Conference. The reigning NBA Finals champions are one game behind Boston in the standings heading into the final round of regular season games. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue said earlier this week that ensuring his squad's key players were fully fit for the postseason was more important than securing the number one ranking. "The most important thing for us is getting those guys some rest," Lue said. "They've been carrying the load all season. It's just the right thing to do. For us going forward, if we're going to make a long run and deep into these playoffs, those guys being healthy is the most important thing." James played 47 minutes in an overtime defeat to Atlanta before missing Monday's game. The Cavaliers are 0-7 this season in games when James does not play.   Curry remains the king of replica shirt sales, the league confirmed Tuesday.

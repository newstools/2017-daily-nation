Four Samburu leaders are expected to officially announce their defection from Jubilee to Kanu Saturday. Former Teachers Service Commission boss Gabriel Lengoiboni, Samburu Senator Sammy Leshore, Samburu County Woman Representative Maison Leshoomo and Senator Naisula Lesuuda will launch their political campaigns at Maralal Primary School in Maralal ahead of the August General elections. The leaders from the current county opposition team dubbed â€˜Ngutung'at (Recovery Team) will be welcomed into the party by Kanu Chairman Senator Gideon Moi, Prof John Lonyangapuo, former minister Samuel Poghisio, Senator Zipporah Kittony, Kanu Secretary-General Nick Salat among other KANU bigwigs. Mr. Lengoiboni is seeking to unseat Governor Moses Lenolkulal who will be vying on a Jubilee Party ticket, while Senator Leshore will be defending his seat. Samburu Assembly Speaker Steve Lelegwe is his main opponent. Ms Leshoomo will also be defending her seat against Mrs. Rebecca Lenkupae who is in governor Lenolkulal's camp vying on a Jubilee ticket, and Pauline Lengures who is seeking the seat on an ODM ticket. Former Journalist Senator Naisula Lesuuda will be battling Lati Lelelit who is in Jubilee for the Samburu West Parliamentary seat. The leaders say they are defecting to Kanu due to "intimidation" and "lack of democracy" in the party at the county level. They claim nominations will be rigged.

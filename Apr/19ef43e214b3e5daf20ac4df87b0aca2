Othaya MP Mary Wambui has lost Jubilee Party ticket to Gichuki Mugambi, her fiercest rival since the last General Election. Ms Wambui garnered 12,524 votes against Mr Mugambi’s 20,228 votes while educationist Ndirangu Gachunia secured a distant third position with 1,169 votes. In the last elections, retired President Mwai Kibaki campaigned for Mr Mugambi’s election on Sabasaba Asili Party but lost to Ms Wambui who was in TNA party. He was a close ally to the retired President as he was the chairman of Othaya Development association (ODA) which was spearheading development projects in the constituency during Kibaki’s tenure as President. Mr Mugambi will now battle for the parliamentary seat with Nairobi-based lawyer Peter King'ara of Democratic Party (DP). Meanwhile, Mukurweini MP Kabando wa Kabando conceded an early defeat in the polls to a Nairobi lawyer Anthony Gathiaka Kiai. "Key indicators compel a gracious concession. Congrats Mr A.G Kiai for winning Jubilee ticket 2017. It has been a pleasure serving you for the past nine years as your MP," Mr Kabando said in a statement he posted on his Facebook page. The two-term MP attributed his loss to misread of political weather and been so confident. "I was so confident of a triumphing. I misread the political temperatures. I'm now rededicating my focus and energy to the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta," said the MP.

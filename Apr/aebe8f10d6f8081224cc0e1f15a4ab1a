For the first time ever, the Commission for University Education has conducted a quality audit in all the universities and made public its findings. The report makes depressing reading, as it highlights the deplorable conditions in most of the institutions. Interestingly, the commission announced that three universities operating on letters of interim authority are ineligible for licence renewal due to deplorable learning conditions, and has recommended their closure. The letter of interim authority allows a university to start operating - set up academic and other programmes – but on the understanding that it embarks on quick consolidation and expansion to progress to a level where it gets full accreditation. However, the three universities in question, Kiriri Women’s University of Science and Technology, the East African and Gretsa, have stagnated, and, in fact, some have declined. While the expose and recommendations are in order, the big question is why it has to take so long to rein in institutions with questionable credentials. Following the recommendations, the universities should be closed down to save students and parents the agony of paying fees for courses that may not be recognised. The fairest action is to transfer the students, believing they had the requisite admission qualifications, to other institutions to complete their degree programmes.

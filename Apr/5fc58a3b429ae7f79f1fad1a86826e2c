Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo has confirmed that he will not participate in Friday’s Jubilee nominations as he has decamped to the Party of Development and Reforms (PDR). Mr Doyo said his new party is "Jubilee-friendly". The governor said more than five other aspirants in Isiolo who were to seek Jubilee Party ticket have also moved to PDR. The governor said he decided to jump ship because of concerns about Jubilee structures and transparency, especially at the county level, during the primaries. “I was concerned over mechanisms put in place to manage party affairs, especially in Isiolo County,” he told the Nation in an interview. 'TOTAL CONFUSION' The governor, who wants to defend his seat against six other aspirants, said he was not comfortable with the fact that sitting governors were also subjected to the nominations. “We (Jubilee governors) had suggested that it was not fair to treat the incumbents the same way as other aspirants who are not busy managing the affairs of the counties,” added Mr Doyo. The governor said he made the decision after consulting his supporters and said he supports President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election in the August 8 polls. “We have witnessed total confusion as we head towards nominations in the county, with other aspirants finding alternative parties because they fear that proper mechanisms have not been put in place to offer credible nominations as promised,” said Mr Doyo. Governor Doyo was to battle it out with two other top giants in the Jubilee nominations, including Isiolo Senator Mohammed Kuti and former Tana and Athi River Development Authority chairman Abdul Bahari. Mr Doyo was elected to the governor's seat on a URP ticket in the 2013 elections.   Governor Doyo has pledged to do everything possible to ensure he retains his seat.

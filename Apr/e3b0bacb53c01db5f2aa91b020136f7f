Germany Ambassador to Kenya Jutta Frasch had called for peaceful General Election as campaigns intensify across the country. Speaking to journalists during the launch of a mining centre at Taita Taveta University, Ms Frasch said her country is satisfied with ongoing election preparations by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. “As far as the electoral reforms is concerned we are satisfied with the elections preparations. We wish Kenyans the best of luck so that there is free, fair, credible and peaceful elections,” she said. The ambassador said she was hopeful that the coming elections would build and not frustrate the economic status of the country. “There has been substantial economic growth over the past years and this trend seems to continue. I hope the upcoming elections will help strengthen the growth of the economy,” she said. However she noted many citizens have not benefitted from the economic growth as many youths remain unemployed. She mentioned that youth unemployment rate stands at 17 per cent and is expected to double by 2050. She said youth unemployment could lead to increase of crime rates, radicalisation and political instability. Germany, through its Academic Exchange Programme (DAAD) has established a mining centre at Taita Taveta University to equip students and staff with more information and skills on mining. Recently, the university was named as the national mining institute in the country.

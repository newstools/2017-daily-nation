Kenya Prisons put up a spirited fight to floor arch-rivals Kenya Pipeline 3-2 to advance to the semi-finals of the Africa Club Volleyball Championships in Monastir, Tunisia on Thursday. Prisons now will face the winner of the Tunisian derby between Carthage and Sfaxien in the last four of the competition. Prisons outlasted their rivals in the five-set thriller 3-2 (13-25, 28-26, 25-19, 23-25 and 15-13), in a contest that last two hours at the Ksar Hellal Jemmal Hall in Monastir. The win was sweet revenge for Prisons over a rival side that has in the past three seasons proved a bogey team in the local league. After a drab start that saw David Lung'aho's charges lose the opening set by an embarrassing 12 points, Prisons fought back forcefully, with centre player Brackcides Agala and outside hitter Lydia Maiyo dominating at the net at the expense of Trizah Atuka and Noel Murambi on the other side. It was eventually Agala who sealed Prisons victory in set number two with a thunderous finish, after the two teams had tied 24-24 at match point following a see-saw battle all through. Pipeline, buoyed by the introduction of Violet Makuto for Monica Biama in the proceeding set, raced into a five point lead by the first technical time out. A number of Pipeline hitting faults thereafter gave Prisons the advantage, with Wacu - who was a transfer target for Pipeline weeks to this competition - dominating with clever tips in the setterâ€™s position in a closely fought determining set which eventually ended in Prisons favour.

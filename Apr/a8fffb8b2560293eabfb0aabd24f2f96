Champions Kenya Sevens posted mixed results, beating Argentina 22-7 before losing to Australia 29-7 at Singapore Sevens on Saturday at the National Stadium. However, Shujaa still have a chance of making their second Cup quarterfinals appearance this season if they beat Samoa in their last Pool C match at 12.56pm on Saturday. Their last Cup quarters appearance was at South Africa Sevens in December. Nelson Oyoo scored Shujaa's only try against the Aussies. Shujaa got their defence off in style when Frank Wanyama scored a try in each half to propel them to victory over Santiago Gomez's Pumas. Unconverted tries from Wanyama and Oyoo gave Shujaa a 10-0 lead at the breather before Dennis Ombachi scored after the restart to stretch the lead to 15-0. Skipper Andrew Amonde would weave through before offloading to Bush Mwale who set up Wanyama for his second try of the game. Brian Tanga's conversion put the defending champions 22-0 up. The Argentines grabbed a late consolation through Nicolas Menendez' converted try. The other Pool C encounter saw Australia edge Samoa 19-12.

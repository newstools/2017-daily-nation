At least five people were killed after cattle rustlers attacked two villages along the West Pokot and Turkana border Friday evening. Four people were killed in Amolem village, Pokot Central while one died at Nakwomuru village, Pokot North after a peace meeting, according to the police. Masol Ward official Harun Kibet said three attackers were also killed but the police are yet to confirm. More than seven raiders attacked Amolem village at around 6pm on Friday in an attempt to steal goats. A fierce battle ensued between the attackers and police reservists based in the area. In an interview with the Nation, Mr Kibet said four people were killed by the raiders while the reservists killed three of the attackers before they fled. “Some attackers managed to escape running towards Kainuk,” he said. Pokot Central Deputy County Commissioner Geoffrey Kithinji said tension is running high in the area following the attack. Mr Kithinji said more officers have been deployed in the area to pursue the raiders. West Pokot County Police Commandant Mathews Kuto said no animal was stolen during the raid as the reservists and the locals repulsed the attackers. Mr Kuto said one person from Turkana was killed at Nakwomor village after a peace meeting on Friday morning. “A peace committee of ten people went to Nakwomoru for negotiations with Pokots to recover stolen cattle. The meeting was cordial and two of the negotiators from Turkana decided to remain behind after the meeting, one was killed and the other escaped,” said Mr Kuto.

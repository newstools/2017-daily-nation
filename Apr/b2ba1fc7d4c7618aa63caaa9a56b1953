Taita-Taveta Governor John Mruttu has maintained that he will be on the ballot during the August polls. Mr Mruttu insists that he lost the Orange Democratic Movement party nomination unfairly, saying the results announced excluded those from his strongholds. He said according to the county returning officer Lawrence Ole Sempele, people had not voted in four polling stations, hence the reason he did not state who the winner was while announcing the results.

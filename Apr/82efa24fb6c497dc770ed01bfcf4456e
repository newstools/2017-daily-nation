Schools re-open on Tuesday for the second term at a significant time in the country’s education history. From next month, the academic calendar will include the piloting of the new curriculum that is expected to start next year. It is a bold move that the Education ministry believes will help Kenyan learners adopt to a fast-changing world. This is an important step that must be handled with care, including consulting all stakeholders. Schools are also expected to conduct co-curricular activities, prayer days and prize-giving ceremonies and annual general meetings this term since such activities are not allowed in the third term. STRINGENT RULES This is in line with new stringent rules introduced following cases of indiscipline — including school fires — and cheating in national examinations. However, the new school term also comes at a time of heightened political activity ahead of the August 8 elections. There are already complaints from Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i that politicians and voters involved in the primaries that end today had destroyed some facilities in schools that had been designated as polling stations. DESTROY PROPERTY The ministry has now asked the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to take action against those who destroy school property during campaigns. It is also important that political activity does not interfere with learning. The authorities must, therefore, check against politicians using education institutions for meetings, loud noises near schools or even involving students in campaigns among other activities.

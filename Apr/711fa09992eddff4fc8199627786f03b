A lacklustre Kenya Sevens side on Friday lost 17-14 to Canada in the opening match of their Hong Kong Sevens campaign at the Hong Kong Stadium. Kicker Nathan Hirayama stabbed in the last minute penalty in front of the posts to give the Canadian the vital Pool B opening duel victory. Poor defending on the right flank saw Luke McCloskey easily cruise to score and give the Canadians the 7-0 lead at the break after Hirayama converted. Returnee Dennis Ombachi sliced through the middle of the tryline to score and level the proceedings for Kenya with a conversion from Samuel Oliech. A charging Canada got a penalty inside Kenya’s 22 metres where Hirayama tapped the ball before intelligently chipping forward. Harry Jones chased the ball inside the try box to score as Hirayama converted to take retake the lead 14-7. However, Kenya restored parity when Nelson Oyoo claimed the kick-off ball before beating the Canadian central defence to score as Oliech converted as the hooter sounded. The Canadians tactfully kept possession to force the penalty inside Kenya’s 22m zone. Also in the Pool, series leaders South Africa got their campaign well on course when they edged out France 17-10. Shujaa will now complete their Pool B outing against South Africa and France at 8.56am and 12.34pm respectively on Saturday. Shujaa and South Africa have also faced off twice this season at Sydney and Canada Sevens and the Blitzebokke emerged victors 15-5 and 14-7 respectively. Kenya and France have shared the spoils in their two meetings this season. France won 24-14 in the preliminaries in Dubai before the Kenyans turned the tables at Cape Town, winning 33-14 at the pool stage. South Africa, who have won four out of the six legs so far in Dubai, Wellington, Sydney and Law Vegas, top the Series with 126 points while Canada and France are placed 10th and 11th with 44 and 41 points respectively.

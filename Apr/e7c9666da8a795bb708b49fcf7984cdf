The Orange Democratic Movement has called for enhanced police protection in areas known for chaos during party primaries and elections. This comes after violence in Migori on Thursday where a meeting of the county election board at Rakwaro Catholic Hall was disrupted leading to injuries. Addressing journalists at Orange House, ODM Secretary-General Agnes Zani accused police of ignoring ODM strongholds during the nominations “in order to paint the party as violent”. “Yesterday, there was a breakdown of law and order in Migori County as police officers watched. The culprits and those who sent them are openly admitting their acts on camera yet no arrests have been made so far,” Dr Zani said. “We demand equal protection. Crime will be committed anywhere if police do not enforce the law.” Dr Zani said police were active in Jubilee dominated areas while only providing cosmetic presence in opposition zones. She said police should be held responsible when violence takes place. “The thugs ruling Migori have been let to roam the county freely and Jubilee is using that chaos to discredit us,” she said. “The President said people who cause violence will face the law. It appears that the concern is only in Jubilee strongholds,” Dr Zani said. She said any ODM aspirants instigating, participating or condoning violence would be disqualified. “We sound a stern warning to politicians in Migori County that the party shall not condone their behaviour. The whip shall be cracked without mercy,” Ms Zani said.

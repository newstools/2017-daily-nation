The Jubilee Party National Elections Board has dismissed claims that the ongoing party primaries have been stopped in some areas due to a shortage of ballot papers. Party Secretary-General Raphael Tuju said balloting, which started on Friday morning, has not been postponed in any county. Mr Tuju insisted that aspirants and returning officers have no powers to call off the nominations without liaising with the national office. He said ballot papers dispatched to polling stations are enough and should the need arise, more will be delivered before the end of voting. "Turnout in all primaries [has] never exceeded 35-40 percent," Mr Tuju said on Friday at the party headquarters in Nairobi. "The ballot papers distributed to all counties cover more than 50 per cent of the registered party membership." He said there is no cause for alarm as the party has put eight choppers on standby to respond to any arising emergencies.

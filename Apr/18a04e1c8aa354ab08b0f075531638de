Kenya Basketball Federation women’s Premier League champions Equity Bank moved to the top of the standings after garnering two crucial first-leg points at Upper Hill School in Nairobi at the weekend. Equity Bank dislodged Zetech University from the top of the 10-team standings with six points after registering a 59-23 win over winless Kenyatta University Oryx. The bankers, who clinched their first league title after beating Kenya Ports Authority 3-2 in last year’s play-offs final, have won all their three first leg matches. Equity raced a 14-4 first quarter lead against Oryx enroute to a 29-8 half-time advantage. International Hilda Indasi was instrumental in the team’s win, leading Equity Bank with 14 points while team-mate star Susan Akinyi added 12. Co-op Bank celebrated a 45-33 win over Storms but remained bottom on the table standings with three points from two outings. It was Irene Makori, who stole the show for Co-op Bank, scoring game-high 13 points for Co-op Bank. None of Storms' players managed double digit figures. Storms, who have so far only won one and lost two, occupy the fourth spot with four points. Zetech University, who had no engagement in the women’s Premier League, dropped to second spot with five points from two wins and one loss. KPA lie third with four points after winning all their two opening first leg matches away in Nairobi. Co-op Bank men’s team and Thunder improved on the standings table after registering victories in their first leg matches at the weekend.

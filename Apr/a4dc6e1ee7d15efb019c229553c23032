Dan Bibby scored a heart-breaking penalty after the buzzer as England rallied from behind to beat Kenya Sevens 13-12 and end their hopes of defending their Singapore Sevens title at the Cup quarterfinals. Shujaa started strongly when Samuel Oliech converted his own try for a 7-0 lead. James Rodwell was to be sin-binned as Kenya cashed on their numbers to score their second try through Frank Wanyama but the Britons got a lifeline when Phil Burgess budged in try to trail 5-12 at the break when Bibby missed the conversion. Dan Norton scored for a hard-working England but Bibby missed the conversion. What could have been Kenya's biggest win of the season never materialised after England got a penalty two minutes after fulltime.

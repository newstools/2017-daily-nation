The Jubilee Party has suffered another blow in Isiolo after Senator Mohammed Kuti, who is eyeing the governor’s seat, decamped to Narc Kenya. Mr Kuti, surrounded by four seating MCAs and an aspiring ward rep, on Friday announced that he had ditched Jubilee, just three days to the party's nominations in the county. The Jubilee elections board postponed polling in the county until April 25. The senator decamped a day after Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo announced he had quit Jubilee for the Party of Development and Reforms (PDR). Both Narc Kenya, headed by Martha Karua, and PDR have said they will support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election. The senator was to face former Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority chairman Abdul Bahari and Governor Godana Doyo. Dr Kuti has been in politics for the past 15 years and served as an Isiolo North MP for two terms under Kanu and Narc Kenya. He was elected Isiolo senator in 2013 under the United Republican Party (URP). Dr Kuti said he decided to decamp on realising that there was no transparency in Jubilee nominations. The four MCAs and the ward rep hopeful with him also decamped from Jubilee to Narc Kenya. The MCAs are David Lemantile (Oldonyiro), Abdi Sora (Garba Tulla), Ali Adan Wako (Kinna) and Ali Galgalo (Chari). The aspiring MCA (Ngaremara ward) is Ekwam Teru.   But Godana Doyo says his new party is "Jubilee-friendly".

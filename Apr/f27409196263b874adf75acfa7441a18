The Nairobi City County government has raised its parking revenue collection by Sh200,000 a day since a clampdown started this week. The county enforcement team has been clamping vehicles that have been defaulting on paying parking fees in a bid to seal loopholes in revenue collection. Speaking to Nation.co.ke, the chairman of the revenue enforcement team, John Ntoiti, said over 60 vehicles have been impounded by City Hall officials for failing to pay for parking. He said indiscipline and impunity among motorists who refuse to pay for parking is a major hindrance to providing services to city residents. Dr Ntoiti said motorists come to town early and park in streets near their offices and only pay for parking if they spot parking attendants. “Most of the car owners park near their offices and place someone to check out for city officials and once they spot them they rush to pay through the mobile phones,” said Dr Ntoiti. COLLUDE WITH ATTENDANTS He said some collude with parking attendants to defraud the county. He put them on notice, saying City Hall will soon catch up with them. Dr Ntoiti’s team has been carrying out operations in the city centre and on River, Kirinyaga and Accra roads. He added that the operations will go on for the next three months in a bid to raise the county’s revenue collection. He also said the enforcement team will continue evicting tenants who have not been paying rent for residential houses owned by City Hall. On Tuesday tenants in Woodley estate were thrown out of the county-owned houses over rent arrears. Also targeted are tenants in Buru Buru, Joseph Kang’ethe, Jamhuri and Kamukunji estates.

Political meetings and campaigns at night have been banned in Nyamira over security concerns. County Commissioner Joseph Kirui warned that aspirants whose supporters clash while campaigning in villages will be held personally responsible. “We are perturbed by the activities of some candidates’ supporters and we are not taking any chances because our key mandate here is ensuring Nyamira County is secure,” Mr Kirui said. Mr Kirui said that outgoing West Mugirango MP James Gesami, who is eyeing the gubernatorial seat, had complained that his campaign banners and posters were burnt down and others torn by suspected hired goons. Governor John Nyagarama, Dr Gesami and John Komenda will face off in the ODM nominations for the coveted party ticket. The administrator said people monitoring hate speech in the county were on the lookout for cases of incitement and warned politicians to weigh their words before uttering them.

The water hyacinth is a real menace to the fishing communities in Lake Victoria, where its spread in recent years has defied efforts to contain it. At one point, villagers were mobilised to go into the water and pull it out, which turned out to be a futile exercise. Experts also unleashed pests to feed on it, but the hardy plant remains defiant. Of course, the biggest casualty is the fisherman, who uses a canoe. The thick growth blocks waterways, making boat navigation nearly impossible. But this evil thing is also spoken of in positive terms. It is has been touted as a source of hardy material for making furniture, as some locals were even happy to declare that thanks to the weed, some delicious species of fish that had disappeared for decades are now back. The latest positive talk about the water hyacinth is by a top official in the Presidency. State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu says the government intends to use the weed to produce energy and make bags. According to him, this will enable the recent ban on plastic bags to be enforced. These are good ideas, but what the fishing communities urgently need is a more comprehensive and practical effort to deal with this spreading menace. With the expertise and resources at the disposal of both the national and county governments itâ€™s a shame to let the weed choke the lifeline of locals.

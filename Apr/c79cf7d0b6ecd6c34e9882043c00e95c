One of Kenya’s leading lotteries, Lotto, has doubled the chances of one becoming a winner after expanding the number of ways to win using a single ticket worth Sh50, from the initial three to six. Using the same three ways to play which include getting auto-picked lucky numbers by buying the ticket through a paybill number, picking one’s own lucky numbers via SMS or playing online, Lotto is guaranteeing three millionaires (Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday) and 20,000 winners a week as well as Sh35 million in prizes in the next month. With the changes, every day is a winning day and every ticket bought enters a participant into the various draws. First is the guaranteed Sh1 million Supa Sunday Draw followed by the guaranteed Sh50,000 daily draw. The same ticket enters them into the main draw, where one can win Sh100 million, the jackpot amount while at the same time giving them a chance to win the guaranteed Sh1 million during the Wednesday and Saturday draws. Two more chances are also guaranteed, the first being the second chance lucky draw on Wednesday and Saturday where one can win up to Sh250,000. The same ticket now gets one into the guaranteed Sh10 million Easter Powerdraw. The changes take effect as from April 1, meaning it is not over for those who did not win last week as every single Lotto entry in the month of April will get a second chance to win through a qualifying free entry into the Easter Powerdraw where one stands to walk away with a guaranteed Sh10 million. So far the lottery has kept its word of changing lives as it has made a total of 143 millionaires with the number of winners reaching 1,698,993, as of the last draw.

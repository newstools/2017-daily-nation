ODM leader Raila Odinga has defended his deputy Hassan Joho against what he called "rubbish allegations" by the government. At a rally at Joseph Kang'ethe grounds in Kibra, Mr Odinga accused the government, again, of frustrating the Mombasa governor by piling baseless accusations against him. "They first said he is a drug dealer...then they said he has a fake certificate. Now they say he doesn't pay taxes. You wonder what rubbish this is," he said. Mr Odinga said the party will stand by its members. "We want to tell them that ODM will defend its members day and night against all our enemies."   It was the second time the Orange leader was defending his chief lieutenant at the Coast. Mr Joho had recently run into trouble with authorities after it emerged he was admitted to university using a false secondary school examination result slip. Having scored a D- at Serani Secondary School in Mombasa in 1993, it ruled him out of studying for a degree in Kenya since you also cannot bridge.

At the Kibra rally, the governor said he will not quit ODM despite continual run ins with the Jubilee government. "I have heard them say I am under investigation. I want to tell them to investigate me during the day, or at night, anytime they want. I will remain Raila Amollo Odinga's general," he said.

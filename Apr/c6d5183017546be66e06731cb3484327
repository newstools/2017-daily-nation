Public university boards or councils have been found to lack the capacity to safeguard quality higher education through proper oversight of the management. This is the verdict of a special audit by the university regulator, Commission for University Education (CUE), amid concerns from employers over quality of graduates, arguing that entry-level workers lack workplace skills. “The committee observed that the ability of universities council to provide advocacy and oversight is weak,” reads the CUE audit. “Consequently major policy decisions such as establishment of campuses had been made and implemented by the university management without the knowledge or approval of councils.” This means Vice-Chancellors have unchecked powers in running the public universities and course developed by the institutions. “The involvement of Chancellors should be more overtly seen as central to the business of the university especially in regard to recommending to the Cabinet Secretary a visitation and giving advice the Council,” recommends the report. Chancellors are like heads of boards or chair of the councils. A shortage of PhD and qualified lecturers has dimmed the quality of university graduates.

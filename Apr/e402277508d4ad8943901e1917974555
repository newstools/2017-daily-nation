Jubilee Party nominations in Mombasa were marred by delays and missing names from the register. Areas where voting began before 9am were Mikindani, Jomvu constituency and some parts of Kisauni with voting in Mvita constituency starting past 11am. The delay in Mvita was attributed to lack of the indelible ink. Said Mathias, an aspirant for Majengo Ward, said they would not accept delays and threatened to withdraw his supporters from polling stations. “If by that time voting will not have started we will ask our supporters to go home and come tomorrow when they are ready,” he said. Voters who reported to polling stations as early as 5am said they are tired of waiting. “Some people who thought they would vote and go to work have already left. Others have gone back home after waiting for four hours,” he said. Mohamed Salim an aspirant for the Mvita parliamentary seat claimed there were some officials from rival parties who were supervising their elections. “We paid money for these nominations and we cannot allow people to play around with us. We know what is happening and we cannot accept it,” he said. However, Sureya Hersi, Mombasa county election board chairperson said officials working hard to deliver materials in the affected areas. "During packaging of the materials ink was forgotten and we cannot start without it," she said. Jubilee County coordinator Beatrice Gambo said all the problems would be addressed. “We have witnessed a huge turnout and I thank the people of Mombasa for supporting Jubilee. We will address all the challenges so that people vote without hitches,” she said.   Mr Mandago's supporters are already celebrating in Eldoret Town as tallying continues.

Governor Evans Kidero has vowed to bring together all candidates across the political divide in Nairobi County to commit to campaigns ahead of August polls. Dr Kidero said that Nairobi, being the capital of the country, should lead by example by holding peaceful elections from party primaries to the General Election. “As soon as the nominations are over and both Nasa and Jubilee have their teams, I am going to call for a meeting for all the candidates in Nairobi from MCAs, MPs, senators and governors,” said Dr Kidero on Sunday at Our Lady of Guadeloupe Church in Kibra Constituency. Governor Kidero assured ODM supporters that the Opposition was keen not repeat previous mistakes that cost them seats which they would have won easily. According to him, ODM won majority seats in the County Assembly where they had 43 against 42 but lost some by the party’s own fault like in Dagoretti, Umoja and Woodley. “…this time we will increase by 7 the number of MCAs and the MPs by 5,” said Dr Kidero. He said that Nairobi County must be exemplary during the nominations and say no to demonstrations or inter-party conflicts while ensuring that all political leaders observe peace during the electioneering period. “We are praying that the elections be credible, transparent and results acceptable to the people of Nairobi and Kenya as a whole,” he added. According to the ODM leader, 60 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from the city county. This, he said, was because of massive investments and ease of doing business. Dr Kidero also exuded confidence he would beat all his rivals because of his development record in city. “All the gains we have made have been because of and that is because of a conducive environment created by my county government,” he said.

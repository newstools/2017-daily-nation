Reckless drivers risk losing their driving licences for good once the digital system starts being used next month. National Transport and Safety Authority director-general Francis Meja told Matatu Saccos in Mombasa to ensure their drivers obey traffic rules to avoid temporary suspension or complete withdrawal of their licences. “The digital driving licence will end disobedience of traffic laws because drivers who keep committing offences will lose points and when they exhaust them, their driving licence will be taken away,” Mr Meja said at Darajani Hotel. He said the smart digital licences are embedded with a secure computer chip containing the holder’s information, which is only readable using special electronic gadgets to be handled by the authority officials. Mr Meja said besides bringing sanity on the roads, the new driving permits will get rid of fake driving licences. According to government statistics, in 2015, 91,336 driving licenses were issued, up from 88,666 issued in 2014. It is planning to procure 6.5 million smart licences. “We are looking forward to seeing a lot of transformation in transport,” added the director-general. The agency’s coast regional manager, Mr Ismail Farah, challenged public service vehicle crews and other motorists to be careful during the Easter season that coincides with closing of schools. “We will be vigilant to deal with disobedient road users especially those with the tendency of driving under the influence,” he added.

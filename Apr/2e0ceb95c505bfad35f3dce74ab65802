Labour Party of Kenya leader Ababu Namwamba has vowed to trounce Orange Democratic Movement to scoop all elective seats in Busia County during this year's elections. Speaking during a public rally in Funyula, Mr Namwamba said the party has a formidable team to compete victoriously. Mr Namwamba, who is seeking a third term as Budalang'i MP, added that the frustrations he encountered while he was the ODM secretary general are now behind him; and is now engrossed with progressing his party. "We have already made a decision and we are not turning back. ODM should forget winning key seats in Budalang'i, Funyula and Busia as a county. "For the last 10 years the people of Budalang'i have strongly been in ODM but some few individuals, who were not happy with our presence, frustrated us. "This time round we are ready and we want to teach ODM a lesson by capturing all the seats we gave them," he said. OJAAMONG LOST The MP maintained that Dr Paul Otuoma, the Funyula MP and Busia governor hopeful, was rigged out of the nominations when the party awarded incumbent Sospeter Ojaamong the certificate despite controversial results. He accused Governor Ojaamong of failing to deliver his promises and now wants to divide residents on tribal lines. "Mr Ojaamong promised our people a lot and after failing to deliver he now wants to hide under the umbrella of his community as if the same people are not Busia residents who are entitled to better services." He was accompanied by Labour Party of Kenya Chairperson Julia Ojiambo, the party's national executive council, and other aspirants. The outfit's primaries will start tomorrow.

Many Kenyans who have for years been appalled by the inefficiency and mismanagement at the National Hospital Insurance Fund will be pleased about fruitful change in the organisation. Reforms in the public insurance are beginning to bear fruit and its members no longer feel ashamed to walk into any hospital brandishing the card. Of course, many sceptics will be asking whether it is, indeed, true that the NHIF has turned the corner and is on its way to being a major player in health insurance. Today, there are 1,400 facilities across the country, providing NHIF outpatient services. Also since last year, the medical cover for expectant mothers and cancer patients has been raised up to 300 per cent. This and many other services are available to many poor Kenyans, who can afford to make a monthly contribution of only Sh500. Medical care is costly. However, Kenyans unable to pay high private insurance premiums, can now get quality health care through the NHIF. The Fund has also enabled its contributors to afford specialised treatment locally and overseas. It is imperative that the Fund continue to improve services to win over the sceptics. For the NHIF to erase the image of a cash cow for some well-connected individuals, the reforms must be enhanced and the benefits publicised to create more awareness.

A repeat of the disputed Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) primaries in Gombato/Bongwe Ward and at a polling station in Mazeras, Kwale County scheduled for Sunday has been delayed. This comes after Saturday’s ruling where the provisional certificates issued to Issa Chipera and Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori were withdrawn. ODM National Elections Board resolved to recall nominations after voting in the centres was marred with chaos and irregularities. The stations affected in Gombato/Bongwe Ward, include Shamu, Mwamambi, Mwaroni, Mwamanga, Mwakigwena, as well as Mazeras polling station in Kasemeni ward. The repeat exercise is expected to determine who will bag the party’s ticket to run for the gubernatorial seat, as well as parliamentary seat in Msambweni constituency. But a spot check by the Nation showed that by 12pm voting had not yet commenced in all the polling stations where the repeat of the voting exercise was to be conducted. A voter, Jermaine Kashi at Mwamambi polling station, said there was no official communication from the ODM officials whether the exercise was going to take place. “We are giving the officials up to 1pm to conduct the exercise, if not we will conduct the exercise by ourselves and declare the winner,” he said.

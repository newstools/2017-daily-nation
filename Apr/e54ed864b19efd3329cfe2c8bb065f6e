Resolution Kisii are the 2016/2017 Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Championship champions.Kisii needed three tries, two conversions and a drop goal to beat Mombasa 22-13 to lift the trophy in the final that was played at the Kenyatta University grounds on Saturday.At the same time, Resolution Impala II edged out Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) II 13-12 at the United States International University Africa (USIU-A) grounds to lift the Eric Shirley Shield Trophy.Second-row Amos Obae scored a brace of tries while left wing Ian Amara touched down once to propel Kisii to victory but not before fly-half Isaac Wafula, who has been at the centre of a controversy over his eligibility in the last few weeks, finished it off with the extras.Wafula was at the centre of Kisii's promotion to Kenya Cup when United States International University-Africa (USIU-A) appealed to KRU to bar them.USIU-A, who had lost to Kisii in the semi-final 6-3, wanted the Union to stop Kisii's promotion for fielding Wafula alleging that he was a Western Bulls player.KRU has since dismissed the appeal. Both Mombasa and Kisii won their respective KRU Championship semi-finals to earn promotion to the 2017/2018 Kenya Cup season. Kisii will be making their debut while Mombasa are making are return after two seasons in the second tier.Kisii RFC chairman Walter Orangi attributed their good run to their good player base which was achieved after they managed to consolidate their allowances, insurance, match bonuses among other incentives.Orangi warned the Kenya Cup big wigs that they will be in Kenya Cup to stay. The strides we have made will ensure that we have a formidable side that will be able to challenge for the Kenya Cup title, said Orangi, adding that they will also have to do some recruitment of players and technical stuff.Mombasa team manager Kevin Odhiambo said his boys had already done what was needed from them this season. We are glad to be back in the Kenya Cup despite many challenges, said Odhiambo. We shall review our season but definitely must recruit. email print email print

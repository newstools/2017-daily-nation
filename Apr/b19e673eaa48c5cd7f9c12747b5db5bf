Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has won the Nairobi Jubilee gubernatorial nominations. Senator Sonko got 138, 185 votes against Peter Kenneth's 62, 504 and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru's 7, 654 votes; in 17 constituencies. In the senatorial race, Mr Johnson Sakaja got 163,446 votes to beat Richard Khavemba (33,109) and Badi Ali (10,132). And in the Nairobi Women Representative nominations, Mrs Rachel Shebesh led with 91,766 votes against Millicent Omanga 53,734 votes and Karen Nyamu 36,828 votes. Earlier, Mrs Shebesh stormed Nyayo Indoor Gymnasium at Nyayo Stadium, where the tallying was taking place. She claimed that her votes in Embakasi North were being stolen and added onto Mrs Omanga's. "I will stay here and stop this process until you tell me what's going on and why my votes are being stolen," said an agitated Mrs Shebesh who was then escorted to record a statement at Nyayo Stadium Police post. She later left with her supporters to Jubilee headquarters to lodge a complaint.   The prosecution urged the Magistrate to deny her bond so as to guarantee smooth and peaceful Jubilee nominations.

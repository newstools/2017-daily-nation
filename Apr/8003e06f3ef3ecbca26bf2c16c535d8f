Thousands of Christians gathered in churches to celebrate Good Friday as they marked the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. In Kisumu, Christians gathered in churches for prayers before marching in processions across the town, the scorching sun notwithstanding. They chanted songs of praise in honour of the suffering that Jesus Christ went through after betrayal by one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot. At the St Theresa Catholic Church in Kibuye, Kisumu, the worshippers, guided by their religious leaders, carried a cross and a portrait of Jesus Christ with everyone genuflecting every now and them and lifting their rosaries. In church, the clergy preached messages of peace and urged Kenyans to shun divisive politics. Father Callori Achok of Kibuye parish asked politicians to guide Kenyans in the right direction during campaigns. “The mission of Jesus Christ was to save the world through suffering and death. Let us embrace peace as Christians that He brought through His suffering and death because in Him all of us are one,” he said. BE PEACEFUL In Eldoret, Bishop Cornelius Korir of Eldoret Catholic Diocese called on politicians to embrace peaceful campaigns during the party primaries this month. Addressing journalists when he led the Catholic faithful to mark the Way of the Cross in Eldoret town yesterday, he urged politicians to stop propagating tribalism as they seek votes. “Campaigns for elections should not be pegged on tribalism. It should be a democratic process that involves all Kenyans from different tribal backgrounds,” said Bishop Korir. He said that the current political campaigns in the country could pose a threat to the peace and stability that the country has been enjoying since the 2007 post-election violence if not handled carefully. The cleric cautioned politicians against uttering reckless words during the campaign period that could incite Kenyans against each other.

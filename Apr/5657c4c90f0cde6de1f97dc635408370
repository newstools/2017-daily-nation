The race for the Laikipia gubernatorial seat has taken another twist after a Jubilee Party candidate dropped out and decided to support incumbent Governor Joshua Irungu’s re-election bid. Businessman Mburu Kamau, who has been a fierce critic of Governor Irungu's administration, officially announced his withdrawal from the hotly contested race on Tuesday in Nyahururu Town during a rally where Mr Irungu launched his re-election bid. His decision comes two weeks after another candidate dropped out of the race in favour of one of his colleagues. John Mwaniki quit the race and teamed up with former Industrialisation Assistant Minister Nderitu Muriithi. Mr Mwaniki, a former county secretary who was sacked in 2016 by Governor Irungu for declaring his interest in the seat, will be Mr Muriithi’s running mate. On the other hand, Mr Kamau, who unsuccessfully contested the seat in 2013, is yet to announce his next political move. MANIFESTO “I decided to opt out of the race after an extensive consultation with my family members and supporters. I also scrutinised my manifesto and found it necessary to harmonise [it with Mr Irungu’s] since they were similar and this will help the governor to accomplish his development agenda,” he said. He also urged his supporters to also join him to ensure that Governor Irungu is re-elected for a second term. For his part, the governor praised Mr Kamau for his “bold decision to support him in the race” and urged residents to emulate such dedication. He thanked residents for their continued support and urged them to remain steadfast and support his administration to ensure it completes the projects it has already initiated. With Mr Kamau out of the race, only five people are now eyeing the seat on a Jubilee Party ticket. These are Governor Irungu, Mr Muriithi, former Foreign Affairs PS Thuita Mwangi, Deputy Governor Gitonga Kabugi and James Mathenge. James Mwangi Woodboy will be running for the seat as an independent candidate.

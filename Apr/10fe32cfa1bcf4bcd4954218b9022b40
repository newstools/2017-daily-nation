Fifteen Al-Shabaab terrorists are the latest casualties in the ongoing Kenya Defence Forces-Amisom operation in Somalia that left many more injured. According to a press statement from the KDF, the terrorists met their death today at dawn at a camp four kilometres West of Catamaa, approximately 104 kilometres from the border town of El wak, Gedo region, following a well-organised attack on their camp. Military spokesman Joseph Owuoth said "KDF Amisom detachment from a nearby location engaged the terrorists using artillery and mortar fire and successfully destroyed the terrorists’ camp". Colonel Owuoth assured Kenyans that operations against Shabaab will continue “until all the terrorists are eliminated to ensure that locals continue to enjoy peace and security”. The KDF soldiers operating under the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) have in the last few months conducted heavy attacks on the terrorists, which left them with many casualties. Over the weekend, the Al-Shabaab terrorists were forced to execute some of their members whom they believed could be ‘enemies from within’ who were leaking secrets of their operations to the Amisom.

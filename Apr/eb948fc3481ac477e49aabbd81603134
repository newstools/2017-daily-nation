Wiper Democratic Party has denied claims that it was favouring politician Wavinya Ndeti in the Machakos gubernatorial race. Secretary General Hassan Omar said the nominations to select the party nominee was going on Sunday. “Any perception being created that the party was interested in giving Ms Ndeti a direct nomination will be dealt with today precisely,” said Mr Omar. He added: “It was resolved that the primaries be held today (Sunday). We do realise that two candidates are participating that is Wavinya Ndeti and Bernard Kiala.” The delays and failure by Wiper Party to hold nominations for the gubernatorial seat had threatened to split the party. Mr Kiala is a key ally of Machakos Senator Johnston Muthama. Mr Omar said the party will rally behind whoever emerges the winner in the primaries. The winner will battle with Governor Alfred Mutua who was elected on Wiper ticket but defected and formed his Maendeleo Chap Chap which is allied to Jubilee Party. Mr Hassan refused to comment on reports that Mr Muthama was planning to ditch the party. “I have enormous respect for him and I think I cannot speak much on his behalf. Mr Muthama has been one of my greatest defenders and my prayer is that he would continue to serve Wiper Party and Kenyans as Machakos Senator in the most robust and aggressive way,” he said.

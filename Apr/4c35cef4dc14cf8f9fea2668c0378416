President Uhuru Kenyatta intervened to stem an imminent fallout in Deputy President William Ruto s backyard after the latter was accused by various aspirants of being behind the growing dissent in some of the North Rift counties. Mr Ruto s office has come under fire from many aspirants, including Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago, who have publicly accused Mr Ruto s aides of underhand tactics meant to frustrate their bids for re-election.On Friday, Mr Mandago, MPs Oscar Sudi (Kapseret) and Alfred Keter (Nandi Hills) laid the blame for the growing dissent against Jubilee squarely on Mr Ruto s office.NO FAVOURITESAlthough they did not link Mr Ruto directly, they said people he employed were behind schemes to remove disloyal and independent-minded incumbents. We are aware of individuals who have been meeting preferred candidates and assuring them of Jubilee tickets. They have been holding night meetings to strategise, Mr Mandago said.While addressing the country after the shambolic primaries on Friday, Mr Kenyatta was quick to defend his deputy saying they both did not have a preferred candidate. We have said that we don t have any preferred candidate, said President Kenyatta when Mr Ruto was asked to explain the alleged interference in Uasin Gishu politics.CREDIBLE PRIMARIES Mr Mandago has insisted his fiercest rival, Bundotich Zedekiah Kiprotich, known mostly as Buzeki, is fronted by Mr Ruto s aides. But, Buzeki has distanced himself from the claims.Jubilee Party s regional coordinator Joseph Mathai assured the aspirants of credible primaries. email print email print

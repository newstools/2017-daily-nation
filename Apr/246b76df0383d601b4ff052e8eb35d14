Five sets of election regulations have been approved by Parliament, paving the way for the electoral commission to manage technology use and nominations countrywide. The regulations were passed last evening and include voter education, party lists and conduct of primaries. The anti-corruption agency’s powers in clearing candidates were enhanced. Politicians with pending cases or under investigation are likely to have a hard time getting clearance from the agency, if MPs approve the regulations. VIOLENCE Former ODM secretary general Ababu Namwamba was critical of his former party’s assertion that it will have a parallel tallying centre and announce results. “You cannot say you respect the rule of law when you subvert the Constitution and undermine the role of institutions,” said Mr Namwamba. He described ODM’s stance as “desperate, reckless and a recipe for anarchy”. “Stop intimidating the referee. Prepare and be fit for the game. Be fit and play by the rules,” he added.

DIRECT TICKET Majority Leader Aden Duale said: “The regulations will ensure there is democracy in party primaries. What ODM is doing is not democratic because they are issuing nomination certificates to the highest bidders.” But Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi, who got a direct ticket, said: “I did not pay anything. It is only that there was nobody competing against me.”

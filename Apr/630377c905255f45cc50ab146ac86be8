Politicians seeking police clearance to allow them to contest in the August elections will be issued with certificates containing their criminal record. Police spokesman George Kinoti said the document would show details of pending cases as well as those that were determined in court. However, criminal records that are over 20 years old, except capital offences and serious crimes, will not be listed since they have been expunged from the official database. “As the country approaches the General Election, candidates aspiring for political seats have applied for police clearance certificates. Police wish to inform aspirants and members of the public that all applicants are issued with the document irrespective of whether they were convicted, acquitted, discharged or have cases pending in court,” Mr Kinoti said. He added that offences whose records are preserved permanently are robbery, murder, treason, rape and drug offences. Issuance of the documents, formally called the certificate of good conduct, is done by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. An applicant’s finger prints and palm prints are taken and are then run through a database held at headquarters in Nairobi. Sh1,050 is usually charged for the certificates. The electoral commission is relying on other government agencies to determine credibility of contestants. Contestants will also have to be cleared by the Education ministry. Those found to have fraudulent academic papers will be locked out and flagged for investigations. The anti-corruption agency, the Registrar of Political Parties, and the attorney-general will also play a key role in clearing candidates. Politicians with ongoing criminal cases, including those battling corruption and hate speech charges are at risk of being locked out of the August 8, General Election.

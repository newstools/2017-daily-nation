Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has selected Ahmed Abdikadir Nunow as his running mate as he seeks to defend his seat in the upcoming polls. In a statement on his official Facebook page, Mr Abdullahi said he chose Mr Nunow after consultations with various groups in the county. Mr Nunow was endorsed by the Wagle sub-clan of the Arjuran clan on March 4 to contest the deputy governor seat. Incumbent Deputy Governor Abdihafid Yarrow announced recently that he would not support Mr Abdullahi's re-election bid. Mohammed Abdi, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Muhumed, Osman Warfa and Salah Abdi Sheikh are also seeking the county's top seat. There are indications that Mr Yarrow is likely to join Mr Muhumed's line-up as political campaigns intensify. In the 2013 elections, the governorship seat went to the Degodia clan, the Senate one to the Ogaden and the deputy governor's position to the Arjuran clan, in an effort to include all the clans in the top leadership of the county. A similar distribution of seats is likely to happen again, as most of the leadership positions in the county in the past have always been influenced by clan politics.

Tana River Governor Hussein Dado has told doctors they will be fired if they strike again, pointing out that their welfare has been improved. Mr Dado said the 12 doctors working in the county's public hospitals will be paid full salaries for the 100 days they took part in the countrywide strike.

"We have no intention to punish our doctors for taking part in the recent strike and that is why we paid them even when they were not working," he said at Hasako village in Bura constituency on Saturday. Mr Dado added: "I wish to make it clear to them that we will not accept any further strike that would affect our efforts to provide quality health care to our people. We will be forced to sack them and hire foreign ones." The governor urged them to reciprocate by being dedicated to their duties. Governor Dado also welcomed President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s directive to all governors to pay doctors who were on strike, but they have said they will not do so.

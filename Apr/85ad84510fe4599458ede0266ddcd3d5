Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said he is optimistic of defeating Senator Mike Sonko in the August 8 General Election. Dr Kidero, who was speaking at Industrial Area Prison SDA Church today, said he is looking forward to battling it out with the Jubilee Party candidate for the top county seat. Mr Sonko, also the Nairobi senator, garnered 138,185 votes to beat Mr Peter Kenneth (62,504 votes) and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru (7,654 votes) in the nomination on Thursday. Dr Kidero congratulated Senator Sonko for his win and said they should now focus on issue-based campaigns. "I am not surprised. All along we (Nasa) knew Sonko was going to be our competitor. So we are not worried and Nairobians will prove that in August," he said. He cited his development track record as his selling point that will endear him to the residents in his re-election bid. The county boss said he has initiated many projects, reined in cartels and reduced garbage in the city. "I inherited a City without a plan and was full of cartels that sabotage and frustrate service delivery to the residents, but now look at how I have changed the city." Nonetheless, he has had to ward off criticisms for failing to address crucial issues such as traffic jams and street families. ODM handed Dr Kidero direct nomination ticket.

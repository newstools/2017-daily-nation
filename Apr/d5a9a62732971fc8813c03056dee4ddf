President Uhuru Kenyatta has praised Deputy President William Ruto, whose non-confrontational approach he said was key in facilitating smooth running of Government. The President said unlike the Grand Coalition Government which was mired in squabbles, the Deputy President has worked with him with commitment to deliver the Government’s agenda on development that has transformed the lives of Kenyans. “I would like to thank the Deputy President because he has ensured that we work together in unity, a move that has ensured that we serve Kenyans without internal squabbles and drawbacks,” President Kenyatta said. The President used his tour of his home county, Kiambu, to heap unusual praise on the Deputy President. CLOSE RELATIONS President Kenyatta – who was accompanied by the Deputy President – spoke on Wednesday in Kikuyu town, one of the stops he made during his tour of parts of Kiambu and Nairobi counties to thank residents for registering in large numbers in readiness for the August polls. The President pointed out that his camaraderie and close working relations with the Deputy President has ensured that what appeared to be impossible to some people becomes possible. “For instance, the Opposition have been wondering how we have been able to construct more than 7000 kilometres of roads among other projects in the short span of four years, our answer to them is: unity and close cooperation between the Deputy President and I,” President Kenyatta said. He added: “We have proved to Kenyans and the world that when leaders work together and shun things that could divide them, then surely a lot can be achieved with the citizens reaping the accruing benefits.”

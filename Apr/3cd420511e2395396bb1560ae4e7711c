Voting in repeat ODM nominations has kicked off in three constituencies in Mombasa. In Changamwe, there was controversy early Saturday morning over voting for MP with one aspirant, Juma Goshi telling his supporters not to cast the vote for MP since there is a dispute. He says ODM should disqualify incumbent Omar Mwinyi after he was arrested for allegedly committing electoral malpractices. Mr Mwinyi, who stormed Bomu Primary school accompanied by his supporters a week ago was arrested and taken to court but has not taken plea. His lawyers want an interpretation on newly enacted electoral laws and their implications on party primaries. “I cannot accept a process that was flawed from the word go to determine my political destiny. I have asked my people not to cast the vote for MP,” he said.

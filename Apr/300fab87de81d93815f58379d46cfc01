Jubilee nominations for Bomet County will proceed as scheduled this Friday and have not been pushed to Tuesday next week, contrary to messages doing the rounds earlier Thursday. According to Jubilee Party National Elections Board chairman Andrew Musangi, some aspirants had announced that the nominations in Bomet had been pushed to Tuesday, but he insisted that this was not the case. “Adequate facilitation and materials have been provided. Ignore any message to the contrary,” Mr Musangi said Friday morning. Bomet County is among 21 regions perceived to be Jubilee strongholds where the primaries are being held this Friday. Other counties holding their primaries this Friday are Kirinyaga, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Meru, Uasin Gishu, Baringo, Laikipia, Murang’a, Tharaka-Nithi, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Embu and Kericho. Also on the Friday list are West Pokot, Nandi, Nakuru, Nyeri, Kajiado, Narok, Trans Nzoia and Taita-Taveta. In Nairobi, the Jubilee nominations will be held on Monday, April 24, while another 23 counties will hold theirs on Tuesday, April 25.

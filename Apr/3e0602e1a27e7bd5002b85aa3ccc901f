Chaos erupted Monday at an ODM meeting in Migori Town, leaving several people injured. Journalists were among scores of people injured in the ensuing melee at the Migori Posta grounds. Leaders, including Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, senators Anyang Nyong’o and James Orengo, and MPs Junet Mohamed and Joseph Kobado, were whisked away by their bodyguards soon after the disorder started. Confusion started when Governor Okoth Obado arrived at the event accompanied by his bodyguards. Upon seeing the governor, some people started throwing water bottles at him, prompting his bodyguards to shoot in the air. Mr Joho and Mr Orengo had not addressed the crowd when the violence started. Migori Governor Okoth Obado was said to be uncomfortable with the meeting. An ODM office that was to be opened on Monday was almost burnt on Sunday night. Also at the meeting was former minister Ochillo Ayacko who is eyeing Mr Obado’s seat. Men, women and children scampered for safety when chaos started. A police vehicle was extensively damaged as youths engaged officers in running battles. Mr Obado’s director of communications, Mr Nicholas Anyuor, said it would have been prudent to involve him in planning the meeting. Governor Obado was elected on the PDP ticket but later joined ODM where he is seeking the party nomination ticket  in the forthcoming primaries. His challengers include Mr Ochilo Ayacko, Mr Paul Odola and Mrs Anne Anyanga.

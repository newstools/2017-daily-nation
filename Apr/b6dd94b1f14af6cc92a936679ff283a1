MANCHESTER Manchester United lost top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic to an apparent right knee injury during Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg at home to Anderlecht. The Swedish striker's knee buckled as he landed following an aerial challenge in the Anderlecht box at Old Trafford and he immediately went down, grimacing in pain. After receiving treatment from United's medical staff, he was able to hobble down the tunnel, with Anthony Martial taking his place. Ibrahimovic's injury occurred in injury time. A 2-1 scoreline left the score 3-2 on aggregate in favour of Man U. Ibrahimovic, 35, has been a sensation since joining on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain last year, scoring 28 goals and inspiring United to victory in the League Cup.

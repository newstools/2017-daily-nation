Bishop Julius Kalu of the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) has challenged the electoral agency to prove to Kenyans through tangible evidence that it is capable of delivering free, fair, peaceful and credible elections. Speaking during the Easter Sunday sermon at the ACK Mombasa Memorial Cathedral, Bishop Kalu said delivering free, fair, peaceful and credible elections will end anxiety and doubts in the minds of Kenyans. He also urged the electorate to have faith in the ability of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to deliver credible results of the elections. But the bishop said the electoral body has the responsibility to prove to Kenyans that it is capable of delivering credible elections. He also urged Kenyans to maintain peace ahead of the general elections set for August 8. “As we approach the general elections, let us remember that Kenya is one and that we have no other place to run to in case violence breaks out. “Let us remember that peaceful, fair and credible elections will bring honour to God and respect to all of us and make us enjoy good life,” he said. “Let us have faith in the ability of IEBC to deliver credible results of the elections,” he added. Bishop Kalu also announced the first tour by ACK Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit to Mombasa since his election. “He will be accompanied by his family. It will be a seven-day episcopal visit to our diocese. He is expected to visit our nine archdeaconries and conduct episcopal services and address people at the mother church,” said the bishop.

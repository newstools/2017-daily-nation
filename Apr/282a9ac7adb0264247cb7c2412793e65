MADRID Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane accepted on Saturday his future could be out of his hands if the European champions fail to deliver a major trophy this season. Zidane's side lost their grip on the La Liga title race as Antoine Griezmann's late equaliser handed Atletico Madrid a 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real lead Barcelona by three points with eight games remaining, but the two face each other in a potential title decider at the Bernabeu on April 23. "You have to ask someone else about that, not me," said Zidane in reference to president Florentino Perez when asked if he could survive without winning either La Liga or the Champions League. Madrid travel to Bayern Munich for the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. "I am the coach and I dedicate myself to coaching every day with strength and the desire that this shirt and this club demands," added Zidane."I can't speculate about the rest." Zidane has an excellent record since taking over at Real in January 2015. The Frenchman led Madrid to their 11th Champions League last season and has added the Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup this season. However, Perez, who is expected to win a third consecutive election to remain as club president this summer, has a habit of sacking coaches despite previous successes. Current Bayern boss Carlo Ancelotti was relieved of his duties at the Bernabeu in 2015 just a year after winning the Champions League and Copa del Rey double.   Atletico Madrid rescued a 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu.

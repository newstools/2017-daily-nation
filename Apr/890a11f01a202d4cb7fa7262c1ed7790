ONLINE FORMTo apply, the party said, applicants should complete an online form available on the Jubilee website. The forms are also available at the county offices in case one cannot complete the online application. All applications should be received on or before Friday April 7, 2017, the party said in a notice signed by Mr Andrew Musangi, the chairman of the National Elections Board.For the county returning officer, who will announce the results from all the five elective seats up for grabs at the county level and issue certificates, the applicant must be a graduate with 10 years' work experience in the public or private sector and be computer-literate.CERTIFICATESThe constituency returning officer, who will give certificates to candidates for MP and MCA seats, will need to have the same qualifications as those of the county returning officer.Presiding officers will be the overall heads of polling stations some of which Mr Tuju said will be merged for easier management and will manage the counting of votes and announcement of results at the polling station before submitting them to the constituency.A presiding officer must be aged between 25 and 45 years, with a degree or diploma and must be computer-literate.The party will also hire thousands of polling clerks, who will manage the counting of votes and the nominations themselves.To qualify as a clerk, one must be aged between 21 and 35 years, have a KCSE certificate with a grade above C+ as well as be computer-literate. email print email print Wiper leader wonders why critics are suspicious of him yet he s best-placed to beat Jubilee in The confusion underlined the dysfunction and lack of coordination between the ministry and NLC.

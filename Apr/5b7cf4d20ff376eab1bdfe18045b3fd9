Skin lightening has become a common aspect of skin care in many parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Shops are laden with products that promise all sorts of changes in the melanin distribution of most skin tones. They have a plethora of names and descriptions ranging from fairness creams to whitening powders. Others out rightly state that they are bleaching creams or lightening creams. The question on many consumers mind is what is the difference between all these creams ? Fairness creams mainly originate from India and Pakistan. They claim to turn skin into a fairer version of its original tone they also state that they remove sunburn and tanning. Most fairness creams promote natural ingredients as the active components. They do not contain harmful chemicals. Majority are vanishing cream bases with extracts of various natural fruits or herbs.Whitening creams are designed to give a white pearly appearance to Asian skin. The term is quite misleading for African skin because it cannot possibly change to white. They contain sunscreen and anti-darkening agents to promote a quick change to white complexions. They are made of a thick vanishing cream base which leaves a white coating on the skin. This layer looks unbecoming on black skin tones.Bleaching creams or skin lighteners are the most intense acting of the creams. They contain fast action chemicals such as steroids, mercury and hydroquinone and promise to give results within a few days of application. They are strong enough to change dark skin to light toned skin. The formulas comprise serums and oil based creams which absorb rapidly into the skin.

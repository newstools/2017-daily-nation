Findings of a controversial new study suggest that a little bit of porn may be all you need to fix your love life. Apparently, watching porn before a first date is the key to the success of that date. The study also found that even just thinking about sex before a date increased the chance of a second date. Researchers from Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology studied 246 heterosexual study subjects, and observed that those who were shown sexual stimuli were more likely to open up about their personal information, which is a key way to build intimacy. This then made the date a bonding experience. The more sexually attracted you are to a person on a first date, the more the personal information you are likely to reveal to them. On the flip side, a lack of sexual interest will limit how receptive or open you are towards a prospective partner. The science behind it The researchers say that the activation of the sexual system makes an individual more open about themselves, which in turn makes it easier for a prospective partner to get close to them. “This happens ( to ) motivate reproductive acts, which involve developing lasting affection relationships,” says Professor Gurit Birnbaum, an associate professor at the university and the study lead. Watching porn puts you in reproduction mode, which in turn makes you more receptive to a prospective partner. The researchers prescribe porn as a sexual primer that makes people going on dates more open, outgoing and confident, all of which are attractive qualities in a relationship. Findings of another new study suggest that the porn habit may only work for you if you are a woman. The study, which has been published in the journal Human Communication Research, says that men who watch porn are more dissatisfied in their relationship. The study involved data collected from 50,000 individuals from around the world.

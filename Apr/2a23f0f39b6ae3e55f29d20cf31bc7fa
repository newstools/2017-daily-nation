Residents of Ingirir Location in Wajir County are appealing for help after heavy rains destroyed their homes and washed away livestock Monday. Area Chief Abdikadir Omar Dayib said residents lost 110 goats, 21 cows and four donkeys after heavy rains pounded the region. He said some residents spent the night in the cold after their houses were destroyed, adding that about 500 residents were affected. The administrator appealed to the county and national governments and donor agencies to assist the affected residents with food and temporary shelter. “I urge the county government, the national government and the Kenya Red Cross to come to our aid and help us with food and other assistance since we cannot access the nearest town where we purchase our food,” he said   He said the road to the nearest town of Buna is impassable. Mr Dayib said the area had experienced a dry spell since September last year and the residents were affected by the severe drought. He also expressed fears that the rains could cause outbreaks of diseases like cholera and malaria. “There is a possibility of an outbreak of diseases due to flooding in some areas,” he said.

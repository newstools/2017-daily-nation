Ford Kenya nominations in Kisumu have kicked off Monday morning amidst claims of vote rigging and bribery. The exercise witnessed a low voter turnout as registered members of the party chose candidates for the August elections. The nominations were taking place in three centres in Kisumu with candidates mainly fighting it out for the positions of Ward representatives. Voting started at 8 am and by 11 am only a few people had cast their ballots with no long queues being witnessed in all the three centres. Mr John Akweyu, the presiding officer at Kotetni Primary School said many people had voted at 9am but the number reduced later. The polling centres are Kotetni, Okore Ogoda and Kanyamedha primary schools. “The numbers are low maybe (probably) because it is a holiday and some people might have travelled. But we hope the numbers will rise in the afternoon,” said Mr Akweyu. TALLYING He said according to the party’s electoral laws, the centres will be closed at 4pm to allow for vote counting and tallying. An aspirant for the Central Kisumu Ward seat Mr Albert Otieno claimed that there were a group of youth who were dishing out money and membership cards to strangers. “There are some people allied to one of the aspirants who are seated at the railways registering members today and giving them money to vote,” said Mr Otieno. He asked the election officials to take action against any contender engaging in electoral malpractice. Apart from Mr Otieno, other candidates seeking the ticket are Mr George Okoth Onyango and Wilfred Auma. Mr Joshua Otieno, a voter, said the exercise was smooth and no hiccups were witnessed. He was also impressed by the location of the polling station. “I am happy the polling stations are away from town where violence can easily occur. Here it is very peaceful,” said Mr Otieno who voted at Kotetni.

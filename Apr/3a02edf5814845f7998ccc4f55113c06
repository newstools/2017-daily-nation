Police in Nakuru are pursuing suspected robbers who abandoned their vehicle and fled on foot. Three AK47 rifles, one magazine, a sword and several rounds of ammunition were found in the Toyota harrier. County Police Commandant Hassan Barua said the suspects had allegedly committed a robbery in Eldoret.   Mr Barua said police were tipped off by members of the public about the whereabouts of the suspects. "We got a tip off from the members of the public who spotted the suspects at a petrol station in Nakuru town trying to change the vehicleâ€™s registration number." Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations trailed them to Sewage Estate, but they got wind of it, abandoned the car and bolted into Kaptembwa slums in Nakuru west.   The Police Commandant appealed to the public to share any information that might lead to their arrest.

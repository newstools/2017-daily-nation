A former policeman accused of stealing two pistols from the Buruburu Police Station armoury in Nairobi and selling them to two people, among them a politician, for Sh150,000 has been arrested. Three people, among them an aspiring Ward Rep believed to have bought the Taurus revolver and Ceska pistol, were also arrested after police traced the suspects in a robbery against a couple, in which the woman was raped. Nairobi County Police Commander Japheth Koome said one of the two pistols, belonging to the Kenya Police Service, was recovered from the suspect in neighbouring Umoja Estate. RAPEThe hunt began after a man filed a complaint at the nearby Mowlem Police Station that as he was going home with his wife on Monday they were accosted by a lone gunman. The suspect robbed them of two phones, valued at Sh17,000, before dragging the woman to a corner building and raping her. He then took her phone, a Huawei valued at Sh15,000, and escaped. BOTCHED ROBBERYBut the man secretly followed the gunman and saw him enter a house and lock himself inside. On Friday last week, police recovered another Ceska pistol with 11 rounds of ammunition from a suspect who was gunned down at the Hamza bus stop on Jogoo Road. The suspect had tried to rob a senior police officer while in traffic. The firearm was stolen from an Administration Police officer.

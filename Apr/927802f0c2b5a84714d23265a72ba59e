AFC Leopards on Wednesday battled Ulinzi Stars to a barren draw at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos to move joint top of the SportPesa Premier League table with Bandari. The draw means Leopards join Bandari at the summit of the table on sevens points, but with a similar goal difference of four. Despite a number of clear cut chances, most of them in favour of a vastly improved Leopards, the two title-chasing sides could not find the back of the net. Ulinzi, who have won one and drawn the other of their two games, left the happier side as their three-year unbeaten record against Leopards remains. "We are a work in progress and I am happy with the point today. Overall we lacked someone to help out Gilbert (Fiamenyo) in attack. One of our strikers is injured. The other isn't allowed to play," Leopards coach Stewart Hall explained after the match. Leopards should have been ahead by at least three goals by the break had Ghanaian striker Gilbert Fiamenyo been more clinical. At the half hour mark, the burly Fiamenyo received a pass in the danger area then rounded Ulinzi custodian James Saruni and seemed destined to tap the ball into an empty net before Mohammed Hassan made a timely block to deny Leopards the lead. Six minutes later, a defensive lapse by the soldiers had Fiamenyo through on goal again but his shot came off Oliver Ruto for a fruitless corner. Ulinzi too had their fair share of chances to grab maximum points from the encounter. Harambee Stars winger Samuel Onyango sprinted clear on the left but Cliff Kasuti failed to score from the inviting cross midway through the second half. "This is a point gained for us because we were away. Onyango was unwell today so he didnâ€™t perform to his best," Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso said. Leopards next play Chemelil Sugar in Kisumu this weekend while Ulinzi host Posta Rangers at Afraha Stadium.

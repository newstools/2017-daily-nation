Isiolo Woman Representative Tiyah Galgalo has conceded defeat in the just-concluded Jubilee Party primaries in the county and confirmed that she will not defend her seat in the August 8 elections. In an interview with the Nation, the vocal legislator also admitted that she will not move to another party following her defeat in the nominations. Ms Galgalo got 10,831 votes and lost to the immediate former Kenya Industrial Estates (KIE) Chairperson Rehema Dida Jaldesa who garnered 18,361 votes. The winner in the Jubilee race will now battle it out with Mrs Betsy Mburugu who is vying on a PNU ticket. Ms Galgalo claimed that the nominations were marred with irregularities and rigging which led to her loss. "Voters were voting more than once in different polling stations and that only means that the exercise was not free and fair, but despite that I have accepted the verdict of the party and will not contest the matter," she said. JUBILEE DIEHARD The Jubilee Party diehard said she stands with the party even when others are defecting after sensing defeat, denouncing rumours that she might contest as an independent candidate. “My main interest for now is to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election in August polls. I urge my supporters to continue with our crusade to give Jubilee Party another chance,” she said. Ms Galgalo thanked the people of Isiolo for giving her a chance to serve them, saying she has stepped down from politics to give room to other candidates. She said she has fulfilled her agendas, including uplifting the lives of women in the pastoral county through the use of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund, promoted and natured talent and campaigned for national government projects in the county.   Ms Dida garnered 18,361 votes against Ms Galgalo's 10,831.

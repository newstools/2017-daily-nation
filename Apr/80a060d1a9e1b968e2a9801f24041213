Police in Homa Bay County have arrested 20 youth and confiscated crude weapons ahead of ODM primaries tomorrow. The nominations, which have been shrouded by confusion and threats of violence, will take place in eight constituencies in the region. The county's police boss John Omusanga said the youth were planning to disrupt a training workshop of presiding officers at Rangwe Girls High School. "They will be arraigned in court tomorrow," Mr Omusanga said. POLL OFFICIALS Aspirants who spoke to Nation said they were kept in the dark over where the tallying centres would be and the poll officials to take part in the exercise. Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga, who is eying the ODM governorship ticket, said the planning was opaque. "I don't know the tallying centre and the poll officials until now and our efforts to have them meet us have been futile. "This is so unfair to us. The officials have repeatedly been reshuffled and we're not told," Mr Magwanga said. ASPIRANT FEARS FOR HIS LIFE His sentiments were echoed by Mr Sam Asiyo who is seeking the party ticket for Homa Bay Town constituency. "ODM Elections Board must take immediate action and restore confidence among aspirants," he said. Suba North parliamentary aspirant Jim Akali said he feared for his life, claiming three vehicles were spotted trailing him. "I am headed to record a statement with the police on the same," Mr Akali said. Rangwe parliamentary aspirant Lilian Gogo said police must remain vigilant and ensure the nominations are peaceful. The youth were taken to Homa Bay police station.

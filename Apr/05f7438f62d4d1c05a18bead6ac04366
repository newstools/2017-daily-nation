A woman has been charged with killing her nine-month-old son before cremating the body at Nairobi’s Uhuru Park using old clothes. Margaret Nduta, who spoke uncontrollably in court, alleged she decided to burn the body of her son Said Hassan Juma Karanja because she could not afford a proper funeral. “Police found Ms Nduta sitting next to the burning body of the boy at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on June 27, 2016,” a prosecutor told the court. Police records further state that Ms Nduta allegedly took the life of her son because he had been sick for a long time. The court heard that Ms Nduta, who alleged in court that she is a mother of five, did not flee even when police approached her. “She sat watching the body of her son burn,” the investigating officer states in a statement to court. EIGHT SIBLINGS Ms Nduta also told the court that she has eight siblings but does not know where they are. Magistrate Francis Andayi directed that she be taken for a mental examination. The magistrate, however, said he will set a trial date should “the medical report indicate that the accused is fit to stand trial.” “Besides the medical report, also a probation officer's report is necessary in respect of the accused,” Mr Andayi ruled.

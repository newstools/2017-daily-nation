Bungoma County Assembly Speaker John Makali is the ODM candidate for the Kanduyi parliamentary seat. Mr Makali garnered 6,473 votes to beat his closest rival, lawyer Edwin Sifuna, who received 3,111 votes, while Gilbert Wangila got a paltry 234 votes. It took up to around 12.10am for the results to be announced by Kanduyi ODM returning officer James Okoth. At one time, a live petrol bomb was hurled near the tallying centre at Bungoma DEB Primary School, where the Kanduyi constituency ODM nomination results were being released. Supporters of various candidates scampered for safety for a short time, but security personnel cordoned off the area. The suspect is said to have fled immediately after throwing the home-made bomb. Bungoma South officer in charge of fighting crime Mahammud Maalim led his officers in securing the area to allow the counting to continue. SENSED DEFEAT After the bomb scare, Mr Sifuna and his supporters immediately left the tallying centre in a huff after sensing defeat when it emerged that Mr Makali was leading in about 22 polling centres out of 40. Mr Makali applauded his supporters for voting for him. He will face off in the August 8 polls with, among others, incumbent MP Wafula Wamunyinyi of Ford-Kenya. “I am very happy. You have showed that you have trust in me. Let us now go back to the ground and ensure that we send Mr Wamunyinyi parking,” said Mr Makali. In Webuye East constituency, Peter Khakina emerged the winner with 4,819 votes, beating his closest rival, Kingsley Mutali, who received 225 votes. Mr Khakina will now face incumbent MP Alfred Sambu of Amani National Congress, among others. In Webuye West, John Musundi emerged the victor after garnering 4,336 votes, beating his opponent Kelly Walubengo, who got 1,536 votes. The seat is currently held by Dan Wanyama of the Jubilee Party.

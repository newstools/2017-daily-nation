With the rainy season having started around the country, it’s easy for the people to quickly forget the devastating consequences of the drought that has ravaged the country for months. Of course, the agony was more acutely felt in the arid and semi-arid areas, where there have been reports of hunger and starvation and livestock deaths. In the better endowed regions, including the major towns, water scarcity that is manifested in dry taps and water rationing is a perennial reminder that we have on our hands a problem that calls for concerts efforts. The shameful truth is that the country is woefully poor at water harvesting. The rains come and most places wallow in floods but a few months later, the same people will be trekking for long distances in search of water. We, therefore, could not agree more with Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa’s call to fellow Kenyans to take advantage of the current rains to harvest the abundant water for future use. But this is easier said than done. There is a need to create awareness about harvesting rainwater, but even more important is the capacity to do so. This is why the launch of the Kenya Chapter of the Billion Dollar Business Alliance for Rainwater Harvesting is a step in the right direction. It promotes the construction of small-scale water harvesting ponds. In the rural areas, support to families to buy water tanks and gutters to enable water harvesting from iron sheet roofs is something worth considering.

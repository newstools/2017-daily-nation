Five hours after the scheduled kick-off time, ODM primaries were yet to start in Samburu County Saturday due to lack of voter lists. Party officials on the ground blamed IEBC for the hitch saying they sent only one party register to the county. According to Samburu Central Presiding officer in charge of Maralal polling stations Letunta Isaiah plans were underway by the IEBC to send copies of the other registers via e-mail for printing. Angry residents who spoke to Nation showed their dissatisfaction in the whole process blaming ODM election body and IEBC for not planning the exercise in advance.

Kenya’s Harambee Stars has moved five places up in the latest Fifa rankings released by world football governing body on Thursday. The Paul Put-led Stars now sit in position 106 globally and 26 on the continent with 317 points from 111 occupied last month. Neighbours Uganda dropped a place down to 75 and 16 on the continent. However, they still top the Council of East and Central Africa (Cecafa) region followed by Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Burundi, Ethiopia and Tanzania. Senegal, Tunisia, Egypt, Congo DR and Morocco occupy the top five places in Africa. Goalkeeper Patrick Matasi, who shone in the final saving three penalties, has called for patience among fans as the team aims to qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) slated for Cameroon. “I would urge Kenyan soccer fraternity to be patient with the current technical bench, management and players as well. What lets us down is lack of support from stakeholders but with patience and the kind of initiative the federation has put in place, we can qualify for bigger tournaments which will twist the image of our national football,” he told Nation Sport on Thursday. Kenya’s next assignment is in March where the federation has lined up a series of friendly matches as they prepare to play Ghana in the continental showpiece qualifier in September.  Meanwhile, world champions German remained top followed by Brazil, Portugal, Argentina and Belgium.

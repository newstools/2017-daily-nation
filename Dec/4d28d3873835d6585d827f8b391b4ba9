Former national motorcycling champion in MX1 category, Tutu Maina, comes out of retirement for the eighth and final round of the 2017 Motorcross Championships on Sunday at Jamhuri Park Circuit in Nairobi. Sunday’s competition will double up as the second round of East Africa Championships as Kenyan riders seek to turn the tables on their Ugandan opponents who won the first leg in April. MAINA RETURNS Motocross Commission chairman, Lee Nyachae, Friday said Maina, the 2014 and 2015 champion who has been out for two years, makes a return.  He has been competing in Enduro category. Tutu is in a field of 55 Kenyan riders. Uganda dominated the first round, particularly the MX 125 category, and will parade 30 riders on Sunday.  With the first round winner Maxim Van Pee from Uganda missing in action, Vinayak, Maina and another Kenyan entrant Ngugi Waweru who finished second in the first round, will battle it out with Maxim’s brother Olivier. Nyachae said Waweru, who holds an unassailable lead in the MX2 Class in the National Championship, will move to MX1 class to spice up the competition.  Waweru stretched his MX2 Series lead to an unassailable 400 points after collecting 60 points with a clean run in three stages in the seventh round last month.  Kenya’s Elias Sherman, who won the MX 2 category in the first leg, renews rivalry with Uganda’s Fatuh Kiggundu, who finished second in the first leg.

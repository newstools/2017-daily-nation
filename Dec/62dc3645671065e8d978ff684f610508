LOS ANGELES LeBron James posted his 60th NBA triple-double on Saturday, passing Larry Bird for sixth on the all-time list and leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 109-100 victory over the Utah Jazz. James scored 29 points, pulled down 11 rebounds and handed out 10 assists. It was his third triple-double — putting up double digits in three statistical categories — in the four-game homestand that concluded Saturday. His drive to the basket with one second left in the third quarter gave Cleveland an 80-73 lead going into the fourth, and he scored 10 points in the final period. James had scored or assisted on Cleveland's first 13 points. He connected on nine of his 15 shots from the field and made all 10 of his free throws. Kevin Love had 15 points and five rebounds, and rookie Cedi Osman scored a career-high 10 points for Cleveland, who are 17-1 since November 11 and notched an 11th straight home win. Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue earned his 100th regular-season victory since being promoted to the job on January 22, 2016. The Jazz were without French centre Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors, who were both hurt in a win over Boston on Friday. Gobert is expected to miss up to a month with a sprained left knee, while Favors suffered an eye laceration.

A former Ruaraka police chief accused of torturing a suspect to death four years ago has a case to answer. Justice Martha Mutuku ruled that the prosecution had established a case against Mr Nahashon Mutua, a former Ruaraka station commander. BEATING The former officer was accused of torturing to death Mr Martin Koome inside police cells on the night of December 19, 2013. Mr Koome had been arrested over a domestic brawl. Mr Koome died as a result of torture and severe beating. Evidence showed that he was assaulted using a metal pipe and his head immersed in a drum of water. When police took him to Kenyatta National Hospital 20 hours later, he had a swollen face, deep cuts, and his wife could barely recognise him, the court heard. The police lied that he had been assaulted by a mob. Soon after the incident, Mr Mutua was transferred to Machakos County as the staffing officer.Â  The court also heard that a plan was hatched to incriminate another suspect over the murder. IPOA PROBE Mr Kevin Odhiambo was later arrested and charged with murder but the case was terminated after the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) investigated the matter and found that the real suspect was Mr Mutua. The court also heard that Mr Mutua interfered with the investigations by intimidating and coercing witnesses who had recorded statements with Ipoa. He was also accused of giving a misleading crime and incident report that Mr Koome had been assaulted by Mr Odhiambo. Justice Mutuku said the evidence by an eyewitness was corroborated by other witnesses. She said Mr Mutua was seen assaulting the suspect and all evidence pointed at him. Mr Mutua told the court that he has eight witnesses to defend him. The court directed the case be mentioned on December 13.

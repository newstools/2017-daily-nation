A 70-year-old man in Homa Bay County committed suicide after his wife left him. The man, identified as Samuel Oloto Onjonga from Kauma Village in Kabondo Kasipul Sub-County, hanged himself on Tuesday evening after his second wife quit the marriage in unclear circumstances. SUICIDE Area Chief Mr Joseph Ndege told journalists that Mzee Onjonga used a sisal rope. "We found him hanging from a mango tree next to his house," he said. Mr Ndege said the man’s second wife left him and went to live in a nearby trading centre. "The old man was lonely after his second wife left him and rented a house in the nearby trading centre following a dispute between them," he said. According to the villagers, his first wife died five years ago and he remarried two years ago. They said he could have developed depression as he has been living alone in his house after the second wife had left. The livestock trader has also had also been suffering from ill health, they said. INVESTIGATIONS Homa Bay County Police Commander Marius Tum said police have launched investigations into the man’s death. "We are told he has been going through a hard life since the death of his wife five years ago and his family members are suspecting that could have also contributed," said Mr Tum. His body was taken to Rachuonyo South Sub-County Hospital mortuary awaiting a post-mortem. Cases of family members abandoning their homes and opting to live in nearby trading centres is rampant in the sub-county. Last month in the same area, a 15-year-old boy who sat his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination hanged himself after his mother separated with his father and a local financial institution pursued his mother for defaulting on a loan.

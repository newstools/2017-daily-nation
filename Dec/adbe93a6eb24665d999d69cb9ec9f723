Ombek Red Devils on Sunday won the Nyanza South regional Chapa Dimba Na Safaricom Tournament title by defeating Awendo Academy 2-1 in a competitive final held at the Gusii Stadium in Kisii County. Awendo Academy were the first to score in the 15th minute through Orongo Vincent before Ochieng Wycliff levelled for  Ombek Red Devils in the 35th minute. In the 80th minute, Odhiambo Rodgers broke the stalemate when he scored the second and winning goal for the Red Devils after Brian Opondo, Awendo Academy’s goalkeeper, blundered in the box. Onyango Victor’s opportunity to draw level for Awendo in the 88th minute was frustrated by Red Devils’ goalkeeper Ochieng Byron who saved his shot thought to had crossed the goal line. Devils’ coach Fredrick Eliazar said the equalising goal gave them the morale to press on and eventually register victory.  “I have to thank my boys because they did a good job today. Tactically, we were okay, and the first goal gave us the confidence and morale to move forward,” he said.  In the women’s final, Plateau Queens scored a 1-0 victory over Ugari Starlets thanks to Margret Atieno’s goal in the 41st minute through a header. Winners in the finals received Sh200,000 each and will represent Nyanza South region in the national finals in Nairobi earlier next year. The national winners will walk away with Sh1 million each and an opportunity to attend an international training and mentorship camp in London next April.

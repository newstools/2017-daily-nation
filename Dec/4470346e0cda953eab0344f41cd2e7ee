The US government has sent its top diplomat on African affairs to Kenya in a bid to push for dialogue between political antagonists. A statement from the Donald Trump-led administration said acting assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Donald Yamamoto will be in the country for three days from December 4. “He will meet with representatives of the Kenyan government, as well as with Kenyan civil society. The visit will encourage all sides in Kenya to participate in a national dialogue following the presidential election,” says the statement from the office of the US government spokesperson. SUPREME COURT Political tension in Kenya has been evident since the August 8 presidential election whose results were annulled by the Supreme Court, and the subsequent repeat election which was boycotted by the opposition on October 26. President Uhuru Kenyatta was announced winner by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and was sworn in on November 28. However, the opposition coalition, Nasa, has insisted that it will not recognize Mr Kenyatta as a legitimate president and is instead planning to swear in its principal Raila Odinga on December 12. Before coming to Kenya, Mr Yamamoto visited Somalia and is later scheduled to head to Ethiopia from December 7 to 9.

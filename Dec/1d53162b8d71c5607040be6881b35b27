Newly promoted SportPesa Premier League side Wazito beat Posta Rangers 1-0 to win this year's Jamhuri Cup at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani on Tuesday.  Former Tusker Youth striker John Mabia came off the bench to net the all-important goal two minutes from time.  The youngster latched onto a long ball from Mark Odhiambo, raced down the right flank before cutting in to unleash a pile driver to beat Rangers trialist Lucas Indeche.  "It shows the winning spirit is still within and it's postseason we opened the game to anyone available. This win simply gives me confidence heading into preseason preparations because I will have a team with a winning mentality," Wazito coach Frank Ouna said after the match.  Both coaches fielded makeshift squads with Sammy Omolo preferring Farouk Shikhalo in between the sticks in the absence of Harambee Stars custodian Patrick Matasi. Dennis Mukaisi, who missed a few chances in the opening minutes, led the attacking line.  Teddy Osok, Nakuru AllStars midfielder Peter Ng'ang'a and unattached Lucas Indeche also had playtime.  Moses Otieno and Harun Nyakha partnered in the Wazito midfield. The two have joined the side from Posta and AFC Leopards respectively.  Joe Waithira's 35th minute shot was parried away by Shikhalo and on the other end, Joseph Nyagah fed John Nairuka but the latter fluffed his lines. Ouna withdrew Waithira for Mabia in the 69th minute, which proved the difference. Rangers left-back Titus Achesa floated in a dangerous cross in the dying moments but Wazito survived. "It was unfortunate having created numerous scoring chances in the first half but loss in concentration cost us in the later stages. We are bolstering our ranks for next season hence giving playtime to potential signings," said Posta coach Omolo.

Kenyan boxer Fatuma ‘Iron Fist’ Zarika deserves congratulations for successfully defending her World Boxing Council (WBC) super bantamweight title against Zambian Catherine Phiri in Nairobi on Saturday night. The huge turnout by fans and fellow boxers was a clear indication that they had been starved of such action for many years. We commend Bigger Than Life Entertainment of Ejay Mathews from the United States and the Kenya Professional Boxing Commission (KPBC) for putting up a good show. We want more of these bouts, but it takes a good amount of money, hence the need to encourage more sponsors and promoters. Credible leadership at the KPBC is also crucial. PAID RANKS More boxing talent needs to be nurtured since very few boxers, both female and male, are lately coming through from the amateur level to the paid ranks. Most prefer to remain amateurs because of the minimal action at the professional level and the frustrating failure by some promoters to pay boxers. The WBC and KPBC must rein in the rogue promoters, who are taking advantage of boxers by withholding their dues. Zarika defended her title for the first time before being paid for her previous outing. The two organisations must ensure that she gets justice as she waits for her next bout.

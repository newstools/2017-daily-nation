The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya’s Director of Research, Agnes Mandu, has urged athletes to desist from using performance-enhancing substances and to strive to compete clean. Speaking Thursday while opening Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) workshop in Kakamega, Mandu told athletes in attendance that they should strive to build a good legacy and win clean. “Let’s win clean and fair. I urge you to desist from using drugs in sports,” She said yesterday, adding that by competing clean, athletes would attract sponsorships from companies willing to invest in athletics. Mandu said Adak and World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) would deal firmly with cases of doping. She said Adak would step up anti-doping campaigns across the country in order to sensitise officials and athletes on the dangers of using banned substances.  Also in attendance were Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association National Deputy Secretary Robert Mukhwana and Athletics Kenya Western branch chairman Francis Afundi.

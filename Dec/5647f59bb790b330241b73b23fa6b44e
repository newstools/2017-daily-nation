Kenya Pipeline women and Kenya Prisons men are well on line to defend their respective Kenya Volleyball Federation Premier League titles after clobbering their opponents in Friday’ play-offs at KPA Makande hall, Mombasa.  Kenya Prisons men, who played the second  match of the day yesterday made mince meat of Co-op Bank in three straight sets of 25-14, 25-14, 25 -11 to make clear their intentions of holding onto the trophy.  A win against General Service Unit,  the other play-offs favourites today will put them in the pole position of reclaiming the trophy. Pipeline made short work of KCB 3-0 (25-10, 25-12, 26-24) in their women’s encounter.    Moses Epoloto’s  General Service Unit started well hitting home side Kenya Ports Authority 3-1 in a tough opening match at the same venue. GSU won the first set 25-23 but KPA regrouped to win the second set 26-24  probably the best they could do in the match as the battle hardened paramilitary side won the ensuing sets 25-20, 25-23. Abiud Kipkorir and Simon Kipkorir showed some class on the GSU side with veteran James Ontere playing a pivotal role for the dockers.  KPA coach Samson Sunguti was not a happy man.

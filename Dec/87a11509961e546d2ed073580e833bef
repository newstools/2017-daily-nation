Almost a month after receiving his handicap, Emmanuel Tallel won his second title at the weekend, beating Patrick Kiprop on count back in the Elgeyo Marakwet Golf Tournament at the Eldoret Club. The handicap 24 Tallel won Saturday’s tournament by carding 43 stableford points, his round highlighted by a birdie on the 17th and level par on the par-five first and par-three second hole for 22 points in the front nine. His second nine started off badly with a double bogey on the 10th, a bogey on the 11, three back-to-back double bogeys before he levelled on the 15th, faltered to a double bogey on the 16th before recovering with a birdie on hole 17 and succumbing to another double bogey on the final hole to collect 21 points.  Interestingly, Tallel, an employee of the Elgeyo-Marakwet County Government, was a late entry, called in by Governor Alex Tolgos for photography duties only for him to tee off.  “I had no plans to play today since I was in church, but I received a call to take photos and realizing my boss was playing, I also took to the greens and later became the champion,” said Tallel. Faith Mburu finished third with 40 points with Sunjay Dodia and Benjamin Chemwalo winning the first and second nines with 19 and 21 points respectively. Nathan Kitiwa was the “nearest to the pin” winner while Florence Murgor and Soham Shah took the “longest drive” honours for the female and male sections respectively.  Nelson Orgut won the silver section followed by Jackson Kiprono and Hellen Yego while the bronze winner was Mike Rotich.

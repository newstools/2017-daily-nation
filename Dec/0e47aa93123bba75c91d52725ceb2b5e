The High Court has summoned Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet to explain why he has failed to arrest Defence Principal Secretary Saitoti Torome who was jailed for six months last month. Justice Joseph Sergon on Monday said Mr Boinnet should explain why Mr Torome is still free after he was found in breach of a court order. SH17M Mr Torome’s ministry had been directed to pay Sh17.2 million to a family whose property had been taken by the State but his ministry did not comply with the order. Judge Sergon jailed  the PS on November 21 after he failed to appear to court to mitigate, despite having been given an opportunity to do so. The applicants, Eunice Makori and Hellen Makone, had claimed that the government had failed to pay them for the land belonging to their late relative in Mombasa. The parcel was surrendered to the government. INTEREST Through their lawyer, the mother and daughter had, said several visits to the Defence ministry to plead for payment fell on deaf ears. The High Court had in 2005 directed the government to pay them. The Sh17,257,930 they are demanding relates to Sh9.2 million awarded to them by the court in 2015 plus accrued interest. In papers he filed in June this year, Mr Torome stated that he does not owe the family any money personally and that whatever they were demanding could only be paid to them after Parliament provides to the ministry money for settling such debts.

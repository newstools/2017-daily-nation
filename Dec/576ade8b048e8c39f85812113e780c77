Nasa on Sunday postponed its planned swearing-in of Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. The swearing-in and the launch of the People’s Assembly was scheduled for Jamhuri Day on Tuesday and, according to the coalition’s statement, was to be held in Mombasa. ELECTORAL JUSTICE The statement was read by Nasa co-principal Musalia Mudavadi at the Okoa Kenya offices in Nairobi. Mr Mudavadi was with co-principal Moses Wetang’ula, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and the committee that was organising the swearing-in. The coalition said it consulted at the national and international level before it made the decision to postpone the swearing-in. The statement further apologised for disappointing Kenyans, who were “eagerly waiting for this occasion”. But the coalition maintained it would not abandon its pursuit for electoral justice. “We wish to assure them [Kenyans] that our resolve has not changed. Specifically, we want to reiterate that any national dialogue must have electoral justice on the agenda. We are not interested in sharing illegitimate dictatorial power,” the statement reads in part. 
  
But Nasa leaders insist they will swear in Raila Odinga as the people's president.

One person died and eight others injured when a lorry collided with a Nissan matatu at Nyambunde along the Nyamache- Igare- Itumbe road in Bobasi sub-county, Kisii County. Confirming the incident, Kisii County Police Commandant Adi Hassan said the accident occurred at around 1pm when the driver of the matatu lost control of the vehicle, hitting an oncoming lorry. The matatu was headed to Nyamache town from Itumbe. Mr Hassan said the injured have been rushed to Kisii Level Five Hospital where they have been admitted. Mr Hassan issued a warning to motorists from speeding along that route especially at Nyambunde area which is considered a blackspot. In August last year, four students from St Mary’s Nyamagwa Girls High School died and sixty seven others were injured in a fatal road accident at the same spot as they took a ride on their new bus before they took a break for their August holidays. “All drivers should also be careful so as not to cause unnecessary loss of life during this festive season,” said Mr Hassan.

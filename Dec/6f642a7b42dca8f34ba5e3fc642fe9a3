Police in Busia have arrested a suspect in connection with importation of contraband liquor into the country. The suspect, who was driving a white Toyota Probox car full of 70 cartons with consignment labelled 'Empire' and 'Simba Waragi', was nabbed at a road block near Korinda Prison, about five kilometres from the Kenyan-Ugandan border. CHRISTMAS DRINKS Busia Police boss Makau Masai said the suspect is part of a group that had planned to distribute the alcohol in Western Kenya during the Christmas season. “We managed to intercept and arrest a smuggler who was importing illicit liquor from Uganda. He is part of a network we have been looking for a long time and his arrest will help us with investigations to uncover other sect members. Police also impounded the Probox car ferrying the illicit alcohol valued at more than Sh400,000. “The suspects are dangerous because they operate without identification and they have been trying to kill our officers whenever they are stopped. We have intensified our patrols especially during this festive season,” he added. The suspect will be arraigned in court for smuggling illegal products.

Masoud Juma and Duncan Otieno scored as Harambee Stars beat Rwanda 2-0 in their opening Group A match of the Cecafa tourney at the Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega on Sunday. The result handed new coach Paul Put his first win since he took charge last month and Stars now sit top of Pool A with three points. Kenyans looked like the better side from the onset as they piled pressure on the Amavubi half. The first real chance came in the seventh minute after the hosts landed a free-kick in a prime position, but Joackins Atudo’s effort sailed off target. George "Blackberry" Odhiambo went on marauding run minutes later before unleashing a fierce drive which Eric Ndayishimiye in the Rwanda goal tipped out for a corner. The home side continued with a series of attacks and this time, Samuel Onyango bringing in an in swinger, but Ndayishimiye kept it out yet again in the 14th minute.  The pressure would then pay off in the 24th minute, after Soter Kayumba fouled Atudo in the area and it was Masoud Juma converting the chance from the spot to put Kenya in the lead. Masoud could have scored his second in the 36th minute from a Whyvonne Isuza cross, but he fluffed the open chance with just the keeper to beat.  Isuza, who was having a good game would then find tee off his fellow AFC Leopards teammate Duncan Otieno, who unleased a thunderbolt that brought the stadium to its feet as Stars went two up at the break. On resumption, Rwanda were reduced to 10 men in the 55th minute after Kayumba was handed a second yellow.  Stars’ coach Put then made his first change in the hour mark, bringing in Ernest Wendo for Samuel Onyango, before substituting the injured Masoud for Kepha Aswani two minutes later. Aswani almost grabbed a third in the 77th minute after finishing off an Isuza pass, but his shot was blocked.  Rwanda brought in Sekamana Madimbe for Manisimwe Djabel in the last five minutes. Put then made his final change with Vincent Oburu replacing Blackberry in the 90th minute.

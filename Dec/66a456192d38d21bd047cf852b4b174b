A patient who shot a nurse dead at a private clinic in Nairobi last week will remain in police custody for two more weeks. This is after High Court judge Jessi Lesiit said that she could not allow Mr Joseph Njoroge Mungai to be freed. THREATS "The accused cannot be granted bail at this juncture, to remain detained for 14 days," said the judge. Through his lawyer Cliff Ombeta, the suspect had pleaded with the court temporary freedom before he pleads to the charge of murder. Mr Mungai is accused of killing Mr Faustine Mwadilo Mwadime on the evening of December 6 at the Chiromo Lane Medical Centre in Nairobi's Westlands area. He was first arraigned on Friday amidst threats from the Kenya National Nurses Union over the fatal shooting. He then requested the court to be allowed to seek medical attention. BLOOD The suspect is a licensed gun holder, has a mental condition and on the fateful day, he had been rushed to the medical centre by a relative. He allegedly started shooting at the nurse minutes after refusing to surrender his guns to the hospitalâ€™s security personnel.

Kagere beat Kariobangi Sharks’ Masoud Juma and compatriot Jacques Tuyisenge to the prestigious award that came with a 55-inch television screen courtesy of LG, a return ticket from Skyward Express, a DStv decoder and a gift hamper from Kenya Wine Agency Limited (KWAL).      “Hard work pains but it pays. I thank my teammates who used to make me feel I can do it.  "I am excited and I thank the Gor staff, supporters and above all God,” an elated Kagere, who aided Gor to an unprecedented 16th title by scoring 13 goals, said.  CECAFAKariobangi Sharks, who got promoted in the league this season, produced two winners: John Oyemba and Masud Juma in the goalkeeper and Golden boot categories.   “I was aiming to be the top scorer and I knew I shall achieve it because I was working hard daily in training.  "I am happy I did it. Now my aim is to play for bigger clubs outside Kenya in the near future,” Juma, whose two goals in the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup helped Kenya clinch their seventh title Sunday, said. WINNERSOther guests were Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Nick Mwendwa and Sports Principal Secretary Peter Kaberia.     “This is just a Launchpad, the next awards will be better,” SJAK president Chris Mbaisi said.

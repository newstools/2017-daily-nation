Despite the tough pin positions during the final round, long hitting Dismas Indiza still managed to beat local pro Tony Omuli by two shots, to claim the top prize in the 2017 Golf Park Festival of Golf at Golf Park Friday. Indiza, who had posted four over 74 during Thursday’s second round, birdied the fifth and ninth holes at the front nine with a bogey at the par three-eighth. He then dropped two shots at the 15th and 17th but managed to pull one back at the par five-18th for level par 70 which gave him a total of four over par 214. “The pin positions were tough and difficult to attack. It made it almost impossible for one to attack but I am happy with a level par,’’ said Indiza who won Sh120,000 for his victory. Omuli on the other hand, fired five over par 75 in the final round for a total of 216. He made birdies at the first and eighth, but dropped a number of shots including two double bogeys, to eventually settle for the second place. Just a shot behind was Royal Nairobi’s Erick Ooko who carded level par 70 for a total of 217. A total of 20 professionals participated in the three rounds event sponsored by Golf Park members who put together a Sh500,000 purse for the professionals. Friday's final round saw club members battling it out for an array of prizes.

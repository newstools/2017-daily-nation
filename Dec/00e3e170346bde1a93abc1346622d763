Nassizu Murume has released a song hitting out at Tanzanian musician Alikiba for failing to honour a promise to him.  In the song Ngoja baadaye, Nassizu whose real name is Osman Marete, reveals his frustration with the artiste who keeps dismissing him:  “Ilianza na Ali Kiba yule king wa Bongo pale Churchill Comedy Show. Tukapanga collabo. Kila mwaka na nusu kila kipiga, eh! Nassizu ngoja baadae. Hata baadae nikipiga, majibu yaleyale, ngoja baadaye (It all started during the Churchill Show where we agreed on a collabo but every time I call, he tells me, ‘we will talk later’. When I call later, I am told, later please).”  READ: How 'Churchill Show' changed singer's fortunes His first encounter with Alikiba happened two years ago when Daniel Ndambuki aka Churchill took the show to Meru where Nassizu is based. The 21 year old wowed the audience with a rendition of the TZ hit song Mwana, so much so that in addition to the agreed collabo, Churchill pledged to help him build his budding career.  In his new song, Nassizu narrates how Alikiba claims he has no money to do the collabo they agreed on. He equates the experience with that of politicians who promise the world but later become elusive. The new song comes two months after he released Illuminati, a controversial song that has been linked to cult-like practices. Other songs by Nassizu include Siwezi and Mawazo.  He is also behind Watanashati Classics, a talent management label that nurtures budding musicians from Meru.

An MP has said he will table a bill in the National Assembly to tame irresponsible parents. The child support bill, sponsored by Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina will require a parent who fails to meet his or her obligation deposit 50 per cent maintenance fee for the upkeep of the child. The amount will be given to the parent living with the child. "The bill is not meant for men only. It is for child support. Whoever is living with the child will get 50 per cent of funds required to bring up the child from the other parent," he said. DNA According to Mr Wainaina, the bill will also see the government provide free DNA testing services to women seeking to prove paternity of their children. "DNA services are expensive in this country. Majority of women who suffer with the burden of single parenthood cannot afford the all-important evidence needed to prove who sired their children," said Mr Wainaina. According to Mr Wainaina, the bill that is currently being drafted will ensure parents became more responsible, especially on matters sex and parenting. "Most men do not want to take responsibility of the consequences of their sexual escapades. The burden is left on women. In some cases some of the kids born out of wedlock end up in the streets," he said. Mr Wainaina believes that, if the bill is passed, it would also help reduce cases of HIV infections as men will be keen to use protection. It shall be interesting to see if the 12th Parliament that is dominated by men will pass the bill.

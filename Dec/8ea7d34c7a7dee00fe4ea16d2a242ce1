Barely a day before lottery firm Lotto conducts one of its biggest draws where the winner will take home five new Volkswagwen Polo Trendline cars, three Kenyans have won Sh600,000 each from the company.  Martin Kamenyi, Dafton Njuguna and Peter Muriithi shared the jackpot from Lotto’s 219th draw held on Sunday, taking home Sh600,000 each. Kamenyi, Njuguna and Muriithi became Lotto’s latest winners after correctly matching five out of six numbers and the bonus number against the draw’s winning numbers 21, 38, 10, 44, 34, 30 and bonus number nine. On Wednesday, Lotto and their partners DT Dobie Kenya Limited will name the winner of five new Volkswagwen Polo Trendline cars in a draw called “Power Drive Draw”. Every time individuals play Lotto, they are entered into the ‘Give Me Five’ Power Draw, where one person will win five brand new Volkswagen Polo Trendline vehicles made in Kenya.  Last month’s launch of the partnership was presided over by, among others, DT Dobie Managing Director Ian Middleton and Lotto’s Communications Director Dennis Muigai. Muigai said the cars will come with a three-year warranty, comprehensive insurance for one year and Sh1 million.

Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Sam Nyamweya has called for more investment in football to enable Harambee Stars reach the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.  Nyamweya also challenged the government to play a leading role in aiding the team realize its full potential. In a statement, Nyamweya also congratulated Stars on their recent success in the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup. Kenya beat Zanzibar 3-2 in the final on post-match penalties at Machakos to lift the regional crown for a seventh time on Sunday. FOOTBALL POWERHOUSE “The victory over Zanzibar Heroes was a demonstration of Kenya’s position in the region as a football powerhouse and testament to the fact that with a little more support, Kenya is a football giant in Africa,” he said. He noted that the win was a consolation to the country after it was stripped of the rights to host next year’s African Nations Championship (Chan) by the Confederation of African Football (Caf) due to lack of preparations.  “The victory has aptly consoled the nation from the Caf decision and gone further to give Kenyans a hint of what they would have expected had we retained the rights to host Africa’s second-tier tournament.

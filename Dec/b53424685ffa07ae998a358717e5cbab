Libya and Tanzania Mainland played to a goalless draw in their Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Group ‘A’ match played at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos County on Sunday. The two sides came into the match needing a win of more than two goals to leapfrog Kenya, who edged Rwanda 2-0 earlier in Kakamega County, at the helm of the group. Kenya sit atop of the group on three points followed by Libya while Tanzania are third and Rwanda bottom.  Elias Maguri unleashed a fierce shot in the fourth minute after a dangerous run from the right flank, but the Libyan defenders did well to clear their lines.  A resultant counter attack saw Alharaish Zakaria denied by Aisha Manula in goal. In the 19th minute, Saeid Saleh had his attempt deflected for a fruitless corner as action swung from one end to the other. With three minutes to the half hour mark, Ibrahim Hajib found Michael Kamagi on the left flank, the latter floated in a dangerous pass across the face of goal but had no one to tap home. Aljamal Tariq thought he had fired Libya ahead in the 36th minute, but his goal off a Taktak Muftah pass was ruled out for offside. Tanzania Mainland looked hungrier to take the lead in the second half through frequent attacks. Libya goalkeeper Abdullah Fathi was forced to produce outstanding saves to his side’s rescue.  Libya face Kenya on Tuesday, while Tanzania will be up against Zanzibar on Thursday.

Jamhuri Day celebrations will be held at the Kasarani Stadium on Tuesday December 12, government spokesman Eric Kiraithe said on Friday. Kenyans have been urged to turn out in large numbers for the commemoration of the day and to rest assured that their safety is guaranteed on that day. “Being one of the most important dates on the country’s calendar, Kenyans are once again invited to rally in unity around the values of patriotism and moving the country forward in the spirit of Kenya Mbele,” Mr Kiraithe said. The event, which commemorates the establishment of Kenya as a republic in 1964, will be presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The celebrations will be marked by military and police parades, cultural songs and dances and the ceremonial raising of the Kenyan flag. The gates of the stadium will be open to all from 7 am. This marks the first public holiday and event to be presided over by President Kenyatta in his second term in office.

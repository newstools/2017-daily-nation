Nasa strategist David Ndii has recounted his moments with the police for the first time after he was taken in for questioning over incitement remarks attributed to him. Dr Ndii who spoke at the Wiper offices in Nairobi on Saturday said he was abducted by police as there is no record to show that he was arrested lawfully. "If you are with ten armed policemen in the forest in the middle of the night you can only fear for the worst," Dr Ndii said. He said the incitement charges he was accused of were frivolous and later turned out to be "fake news". "By the time I was done with the police at DCI, they were embarrassed with what they were accusing me of because it was fake news, " he said. Dr Ndii said the government is determined to defeat alternative voice by way of intimidation. He was speaking during a committee meeting for members organising Nasa's planned 'swearing-in' of opposition leader Raila Odinga.  The committee said it is facing challenges on whether to swear-in Mr Odinga in the absence of his deputy Kalonzo Musyoka, who is in Germany. 
  
Nasa and police give conflicting reports on arrest of the economist in Kwale.

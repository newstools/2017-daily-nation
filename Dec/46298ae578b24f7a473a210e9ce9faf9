Kwale Welfare and Education Association (KWEA), a girl-child education charity, has raised Sh400,000 for educating needy girls in the county. Speaking during an annual charity walk in Msambweni Constituency, Kwea chairman Juma Mwasere said they had embarked on a mission to improve education standards in the county by focusing on educating girls. SCHOOL He said the ultimate goal for the walk was to raise Sh1 million to cater for the school fees of 26 girls in various secondary schools. The chairman added that the girls were drawn from all the four sub-counties of Kwale. He said many girls do not achieve their dreams because of a myriad of challenges they face, including teenage pregnancies and early marriages. “We are focusing on girl-child education because most families have neglected girls and we would like to change the attitude in our families," Mr Mwasere said. GIRLS County Finance executive Bakari Sebe underscored the importance of educating girls. He gave an example of how Rwanda’s economy has grown tremendously because of the impact of educating girls. "Women have played a role in the growth of the economy of Rwanda because they have more women in Parliament who make laws that benefit all citizens," Mr Sebe said.

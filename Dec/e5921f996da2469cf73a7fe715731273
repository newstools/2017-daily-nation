The annual Biro Lich Basketball tournament will be held this weekend at Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground in Kisumu. This year’s games will mark the fourth edition of the tournament which aims at promoting basketball in the region as well as nurturing talent. Defending champions Kisumu Allstar, formerly known as Kisumu Allstar formerly known as Team Jalils, have fired the warning shot to title rivals ahead of the competition. Speaking to Nation Sport in Kisumu Friday, Kisumu Allstar head coach Oliver Nyawanda said he expects the tournament to  be competitive but his team is prepared for any eventuality as his players seek to retain the title.  Nyawanda said his players have trained well for the championship. “We want to be the first team to retain the title. All the teams will be focusing on carrying the day but we are prepared for their challenge,” said Coach Nyawanda.  The number of teams competing in this year’s tournament has reduced to 10 from 13 last year but organizers are upbeat that it will be a success tournament. Chris Kinyua, president of Pacho 360 Hoops who are the tournament’s organizers, said: “The stage is set for the tournament. We anticipate a thrilling showdown because 10 teams will be fighting for the title. We are also expecting basketball coaches from Strathmore University and his counterpart from United State International University - Africa to grace the tournament and to share skills with the competing teams.” Previously, the tournament has been held twice a year but organisers have clarified that it will only take place once this year. The 10 competing teams are Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology (JOOUST), Natives, Andaki, Pacho, Tritons, Mbale Saints, Team Wazee, Team Mamba,  Team Barcardia, Allstars and LadyBucks.

Police in Homa Bay are pursuing boda boda riders who have torched a passenger bus which was travelling from Nairobi. The bus had stopped at a petrol station in Homa Bay Town Sunday morning to drop a passenger before a boda boda rider rammed into it from behind. According to an eyewitness, luggage was being removed from the vehicle when the rider hit the bus sustaining injuries. A passenger who was in the bus was also hurt. It was then that other riders attacked the bus driver, forcing him to flee before they poured petrol on the vehicle and set it ablaze. Homa Bay OCPD Essau Ochorokodi confirmed the incident, saying that the rider and a passenger who was in the bus are currently recuperating at the Homa Bay County Teaching and Referral Hospital. During the incident some luggage belonging to passengers was burnt. Mr Ochorokodi said investigations had been launched into the incident. "We have begun pursuing the boda boda riders who torched the bus," said Mr Ochorokodi.

Defending champions Uganda will Monday afternoon confront Burundi in a Group “B” match at Bukhungu Stadium in the only fixture of day two of the Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup. Boasting a record 14 titles at this regional showpiece, Uganda Cranesstart as favourites - on paper - to pick maximum points from this fixture.  Under local coach Moses Basena, Cranes have had an arguably good year, beating Egypt at home and finishing second behind the north Africans and ahead of the Republic of Congo and Ghana in their 2018 World Cup qualifier group. But this is a different team from the one that competed in the qualifiers, with Basena who’s replaced Serbian Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic on a stand in basis, insisting in an interview with Nation Sport of his desire to enhance the Ugandans impressive show. “We are using this tournament primarily to prepare for Chan (African Nations Championship), but will also aim to win the event. The first step is to get out of our group,” said Basena. Among the players to watch out for in Uganda’s set up are KCCA midfielder Sadam Juma, Vipers defender Nicholas Wadada and the skillful AFC Leopards midfielder Allan Katerregga, who is on loan at KCCA. Known for their grit and skill, Burundi’s Swallows are seeking their first ever Cecafa title with their best finish being the runners-up position attained in 2004. In the absence of the injured Kenyan based duo Alexis Kitenge and Karim Nizigiyimana, Burundi coach Olivier Niyugeko will likely rely on Simba forward Laudi Mavugo and ex-Sofapaka striker Abdoul Fiston Razak. Gor Mahia’s Nizigiyimana injured his left foot during their SportPesa Premier League match against Mathare United in October and similarly Kitenge is nursing a tight hamstring obtained will turning out for AFC Leopards in the same league. Whoever wins Monday's match will not doubt send out a loud message of their intent considering both sides are tipped to do well. Ethiopia and South Sudan are the other sides in this group.

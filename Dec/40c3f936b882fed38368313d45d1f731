Commercial sex workers in Kisii Town on Friday protested against the killing of their colleague on Wednesday. They matched though Kisii Town streets, calling for justice, wearing red T-Shirts inscribed “Stop Violence against Commercial Sex Workers”. TARGETS Officials – Ms Phyllis Ogendi and Ms Alice Moraa – said there was an increase in attacks on sex workers. At least four other women have been killed in the recent past, said Ms Ogendi, the Commercial Sex Workers Union, Kisii County president.   Later, the commercial sex workers converged at a deserted bushy area in Nyanchwa's Nubia area where their colleague, identified as Jackline, was killed. They prayed and then dispersed. No suspect has been seized in connection with the killing. INVESTIGATE "We categorically condemn the killings and urge for a quick probe into the wanton murder of Ms Jackline," said Ms Ogendi.   She said the more than 1,200 commercial sex workers in the town were worried about their security. Ms Ogendi accused security agents of dragging their feet in investigations. "If it was some senior politician killed here police could have arrested some suspects and even charged them in court. What happens when our colleague is killed?” she questioned.   RIGHTS She said commercial sex workers also pay taxes and should enjoy full rights just as other Kenyans do. "Let this discrimination stop otherwise we will get killed as the government watches," Ms Ogendi said. Her deputy, Ms Moraa, said they would hold more protests if no action is taken against the killers.   A Nyanchwa resident, Mr James Obiri, urged the county to develop the area where the killings often take place. He said many more unsuspecting women have escaped death on the valley. "The solution lies in developing this area so that we minimise places where such heinous incidents take place," said Mr Obiri.

Hi, My pal is getting married and she invited me to be a member of her wedding committee. She knows we are both hustlers and she also knows I can’t say no to her because she is my BFF( Best friend forever). We will need to pledge amounts at the committee and I can either put down a truthful figure ( I’m super-broke so you can guess how many zeroes it will have) or I can put a figure to save face and find a way to finance it…how do I get out of this?  Oh no! Your friend is being an inconsiderate bridezilla. Hopefully when the bewitching off the wedding cools down, she'll see that. If you're not going to be honest with her now, then you're going to be an unwilling participant in her exorbitant lifestyle as she walks all over you like the doormat she will know you to be. If your pal knows you are a hustler and is still asking you for inordinate amounts of money, politely back out of the wedding committees – it's not a sin to be a hustler and not have cash to spare, even though you want to. Don't let her use you at the risk of impoverishing yourself. If she wants a fancy wedding, then she should be able to fund it without making you lie. Contribute what you can and what you're willing to, and then back off. Think of it as practice – this isn't the first starry-eyed oblivious almost-newlywed you'll have to say no to, and it certainly won't be the last. *** Do you have a problem for Brenda?

In all honesty, I think the problem is the men.

Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Saturday announced the semi-final matches of the Senior Challenge Cup tournament will be staged at Moi Stadium in Kisumu.  This venue had earlier been earmarked to host Group ‘A’ matches involving hosts Harambee Stars, but the matches were moved to Machakos over security concerns. Speaking at a press briefing Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o assured Cecafa secretary general Nicholas Musonye and FKF president Nick Mwendwa all visitors touring the lakeside city will be safe. “Just recently I issued executive order number one banning demos in Kisumu therefore no threats will be witnessed. I am much pleased that once again the county has football back, I call upon fans to show up in masses and support their teams,” he said. Mwendwa hinted at more changes in venues depending with the weather conditions, “we only needed surety from the county government of security in the county and the governor has done that. Machakos will host the final.” At the same time, FKF vice president Doris Petra was among five members elected to the Council’s executive committee during their annual congress. Others are Abdiqaani Arab Said (Somalia), Aimable Habimana (Burundi), Juneid Basha (Ethiopia) and Wallace Karia (Tanzania) who will serve for the next two years under the presidency of Sudan FA boss Mutasim Gafar.

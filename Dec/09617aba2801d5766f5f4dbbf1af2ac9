Hi Brenda, I've been feeling kind of conflicted lately. I'm not gay and the imagination of sex with another man actually disgusts me.  However, I discovered transsexual pornography and the weird thing is, it turns me on and I jerk off to it.  This is why I feel conflicted because even though they have a male organ, am attracted to their femininity and in my mind, if I get a chance to have sex with a hot transsexual, I won't hesitate.  This brings me to my question, does that make me gay? Please help! Yours,Yujiro  Hi Yujiro, I can understand why you are conflicted. In this every changing world of acronyms and political correctness, a lot of things can be confusing about sexuality.  You say that the image of sex with another man disgusts you so you are probably not gay. The word homosexual means attracted, whether romantically or sexually, to members of the same sex.  That being said, only you can really decide what you really are and who you choose to be. Don't be afraid of society's labels because at the end of the day you are the one who has to live with yourself.  Your conflict is probably one that is prompted by external influences because you have already acknowledged what you are attracted to.  You know what you want. I would definitely say that you should read up some more on the subject. Information is power. *** Do you have a problem for Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com

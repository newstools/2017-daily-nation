The Wiper Democratic Party has scoffed at reports in the Sunday Nation suggesting that its leader Kalonzo Musyoka wants a seat in the National Assembly. The party described the report as “baseless, unfortunate and demeaning” to Mr Musyoka. ‘FALSE REPORT’ They argued that its aim was to demoralise supporters and they demanded an apology from the Nation. In a statement, Deputy Secretary-General Peter Mathuki said Mr Kalonzo is focused on the 2022 general election after his support for Mr Raila Odinga in 2013 and 2017. “Wiper Democratic Party members are all saddened by this article whose purpose is to kill their morale and demean their party leader, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka,” Mr Mathuki said. ‘MISLEADING’ In the article, the Sunday Nation had reported that leaders from Ukambani want Mr Musyoka to be in Parliament as they fear that his absence from the executive and Parliament for the next five years will highly undermine his political ambition. It further stated that the death of Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze has further heightened pressure on the Wiper leader to join Parliament. But the Party rejects this, saying the report is misleading. “Mr Musyoka does not come from Kitui West, therefore this is a misplaced impression,” said Mr Mathuki.

A crisis may be looming in the Tana River County Assembly after MCAs adjourned for recess on Wednesday without approving the list of nominees for the County Executive Committee. Speaking to the Nation, Minority Leader Abdi Argamso said the list had been rejected for lacking a gender balance and representation of people living with disability. “The list did not meet the required needs where the aspect of gender balance was to be considered, and people with disability were to be represented,” he said. However, the Deputy Leader of Majority, Bonaya Salim, has disputed the claims made by Mr Argamso. Mr Bonaya said the list of nominees was returned to the office of Governor Dhadho Godana as it lacked the required attachments of the nominees enlisted. “Those allegations are not necessarily true. The list lacked the curriculum vitae and the academic credentials of the nominees, which is why it was sent back to the Governor’s office,” he said. Mr Bonaya said the list was brought to the clerk with the required documents, but the House could not sit to debate it as the two weeks’ time they had given the Governor had elapsed. However, he said the House would be recalled any time for a special sitting to discuss the list and approve it.

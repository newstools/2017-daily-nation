A UK-based economic and financial intelligence publication has named KCB Group Plc as the 2017 Bank of the Year in the just concluded 18th Banker Awards. During the event held in London last Thursday, The Banker cited KCB for its sustainable growth and multi-channelled approach that helped increase financial inclusion across the region. The Banker Awards recognise the top banks across the globe for their sound financial performance, their multi-channel banking strategies and efforts that drive financial inclusion. KCB Group CEO Joshua Oigara welcomed the award, saying the award affirmed that the bank was on the right path to realising its goals. “As a Bank we are delighted to be recognised for the work we do in pushing the sustainability agenda and financial inclusion agenda. It is also a challenge for us to keep doing more not just in Kenya but across the East African region,” he said. The London award comes hardly a month after the lender won the Financial Times award as the Best Bank in Kenya and is the current holder of the 2017 Best Corporate Publication award received from the Public Relations Society of Kenya.

A petition which was filed against the election of Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang' has been withdrawn. Businessman Fred Rabong'o who vied against Mr Kajwang' challenged his victory at the Homa Bay Election Court but withdrew the petition the "to join forces" with other members of the Nasa coalition in their quest for electoral justice and democracy in the country. COMMON AGENDA "It is only by withdrawing this petition that the petitioner as well as the respondent can focus their energies and resources towards the common agenda the coalition has adopted," read part of the withdrawal notice. Mr Rabong'o in his petition, sought to nullify the election of Mr Kajwang' over claims of rigging and other electoral malpractice. Lawyer Humprey Obach who represented Mr Rabong'o said the businessman withdrew the petition in good will. "Mr Rabong'o has withdrew the petition in their interest of Nasa leader Raila Odinga who is persuing electoral justice in the country," said Mr Obach. In the last General Election, Mr Rabong'o who vied for the Homa Bay senatorial seat on independent ticket wasÂ  defeated by Mr Kajwang' who retained his seat on Orange Democratic Movement Party ticket. The case was heard before Judge Joseph Karanja who has since written to the clerk of the senate over the withdrawal.  Speaking to the Nation, Senator Kajwang' commended Mr Rabong'o for accepting will of the people. "We should now join hands to strengthen devolution, and bring development to our county," he said.

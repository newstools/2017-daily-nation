Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has fired Kenya Simbas head coach Jerome Paarwater. A statement from KRU on Monday indicated that the union's board met to come up with the decision saying they will announce his replacement soon. The board indicated that it acknowledged Paarwater’s significant contribution, and in particular to the Simbas coaching and management team since his arrival in 2012. “Jerome has been a key influence for the Simbas, guiding the team up the world rankings and making the team a formidable force on the continental stage. He has certainly been part and parcel of the country’s continued emergence in the longer version of the game," said the statement.  "KRU would like to appreciate Jerome’s efforts and wish him well in his endeavors and will announce his replacement at a later time." Paarwater's last assignment with Kenya Simbas was the Hong Kong Cup of Nations two weeks ago, where the team lost to hosts Hong Kong, Chile and Russia in the four nations event. Paawater also almost guided the Simbas to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where the team failed to advance on superior aggregate. Namibia got the nod during the 2014 qualifiers alongside automatic qualifiers South Africa. However, a source at the Union read malice in Paarwater's sacking saying some top Kenya Cup clubs had a hand in the decision.  "The so called Kenya Cup clubs caucus want to control everything at the Union. They want a local coach to take over the team," said the source. Paarwater's dismissal comes at a time when Kenya Simbas are preparing for the 2019 World Cup qualifiers due for next year. When contacted for comments KRU chairman Richard Omwela declined to give more details saying he was out of town.  " A statement has been issued and am out of town," said Omwela.  The fate of Paawater's assistants Dominique Habimana and Charles Ngowi alongside team manager Wangila Simiyu isn't known. They have been in the technical bench since Paawater took charge.

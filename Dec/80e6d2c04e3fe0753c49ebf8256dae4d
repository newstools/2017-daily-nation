An election court in Homa Bay has ordered a recount of the votes cast in the August 8 election in 53 polling stations in Nyatike Constituency, Migori County. Justice Joseph Karanja, hearing the petition filed by Mr Fredrick Odiso to challenge the victory of Nyatike MP Tom Odege, made the decision after lawyers in the case agreed to narrow down the petitionerâ€™s demands to vote recount. PETITION Mr Odiso had initially asked the court to nullify Mr Odege's victory over claims of irregularities and requested a scrutiny of election materials used in the poll. But after consultations among his lawyer Steve Biko, IEBC's lawyer Fredrick Orego and Mr Odege's lawyer Kennedy Okong'o, they agreed to narrow the case to recount of votes. "The recount of the votes in the queried polling stations shall help in fast-tracking the case to its conclusion," said lawyer Okong'o. Among the polling stations whose votes will be recounted include Aonge Dhiang', Wang'e Long'o, Thim Lich, God Bim and Got Kachola.   VOTE RECOUNT According to Mr Biko, the recount of votes in the polling stations should reveal queries raised by Mr Odiso in the case. "The recount of votes in the disputed polling stations will reveal the irregularities committed by the electoral commission in the election," said Mr Biko. Justice Karanja said the report from the recount would determine the direction of the case. "The petitioners shall abide by the outcome of vote recount and the petition shall be concluded on the basis of the results," said judge Karanja. The recount shall be done at the commission's warehouse in Macalder, Nyatike, from December 20-23.

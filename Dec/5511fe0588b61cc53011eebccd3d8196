Kenyan international midfielder Eric Johanna Omondi could join Swedish top flight club IF Brommapojkarna, Nation Sport understands. The player was invited to train with the side after a stellar performance in the just concluded Swedish third tier while representing his club, Vasalund IF. The 23-year-old, despite Vasalund dropping to fourth division, put in some convincing performance scoring five goals in 22 appearances, a streak that attracted Brommapojkarna scouts. “Johanna Omondi has been tested by Brommapojkarna - who continues to look about his house for the Swedish comeback this week,” said a statement on Swedish site Fotbolldirekt on Friday. Johanna, crowned the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) midfielder of the year in 2016, joined the side on a three year deal in January from Mathare United. He has three goals in 18 games for the national team.  Brommapojkarna booked a ticket in the Swedish top tier, known as Allsvenskan alongside Dalkurd, by finishing top of the 16-team 2017 Supperretan table. They won 19 matches, drew five and lost only six. The team, the largest football club in Europe in terms of the number of active teams of all ages, is based in Stockholm. It’s famous for its youth academy, which has produced numerous top-quality Swedish players throughout the years.

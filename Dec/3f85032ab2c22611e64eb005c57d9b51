Handicap 24 golfer Benjamin Kibuku claimed top honours in category ‘A’ of the annual Wazee Hukumbuka golf tournament at the weekend despite double-bogeying four holes at the nine-hole Kiambu Golf Club course at the weekend. The day did not appear a good one for Kibiku as he dropped two shots at the par four-first, followed it with an eight at the par five-second, but managed to role in a number of pars there after for gross 95 which gave him 71 nett to beat Julius Kinyua and third placed John Kungu by four shots.  In men’s ‘B’ category, Joseph Muchigi birdied the eighth, 15th and 17th holes in addition to four pars for gross 83 and a nett 69.  He won by three shots from George Muiruri while winning the top category in the ladies section was Sophie Njenga on 73 nett, winning by three shots from Susan Kanyora and Phyllis Kimbo.  In ‘B’ category, Charity Njoroge posted 74 nett to win by the narrow margin of one shot from Teresia Wainaina and Joyce Gikunda. The subsidiary title went to Moses Njuguna on nett 72 after a countback with David Kimani while Judy Njuguna won the ladies subsidiary on 77 nett.  At Eldoret, James Komen, playing off handicap 15 was in his form during the weekend as he fired a hot 45 points in the high scoring inaugural Starbex golf tournament, to walk away with the overall title. He however had to beat lady golfer Catherine Gatua on countback.  Komen birdied the seventh, 10th and 15th with nine pars to add having picked three bogeys and a triple at the sixth. Hatua had six pars and a birdie for her card. Benjamin Chemwello was third with 41 points also after a countback with H.S. Plahe while Kakamega’s H. Ikhokoro was fifth with 40 points.

The national cricket team lost a good opportunity to advance to the 2019 Cricket World Cup qualifiers by coming fifth in the World Cricket League in Dubai. Kenya lost heavily to Scotland, who qualified alongside the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. Kenya, who have now been relegated to the World Cricket Division II next year, must now win or finish in the top two for another chance to make it to the 2019 Cricket World Cup qualifiers in Zimbabwe in March. The Division II contest must be held before the qualifier. That Kenya only won six out of 13 matches in the World Cricket League is a clear manifestation of how low our standards have sunk. AWFUL RESULT Losing to the likes of Nepal, Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea is a sad and awful result for a team that reached the World Cup semi-finals in 2003, and almost got full test status. Kenya failed to qualify for the 2015 World Cup and could suffer a similar fate in 2019. Cricket Kenya must now develop the game right from the grassroots for the country to rediscover its past glory. Programmes for the Under-17 and Under-19 groups could be a solution to our problems and must be introduced. But there is some joy and hope after the Kenya Under-19 men’s team qualified for the 2019 World Cup in New Zealand in January.

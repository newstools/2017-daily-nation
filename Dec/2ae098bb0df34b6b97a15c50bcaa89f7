Kenya Open Amateur Strokeplay champion Daniel Nduva levelled the Nyali Golf and country club course to jump to the top of the leader board in day two of this year’s Nyali Open golf championship on Saturday. This was despite his double bogey fourth hole par four, and a bogey at the 11th where he drove out of bound during the opening round.  “I missed several shot putts for birdies for a possible low round though I am still have with a level par, could have been worse’’ said Nduva.  He started with a birdie at the par five-first hole, dropped one at the third par three, at his double at the fourth, but managed to recover two shots at the fifth and seventh.  He picked up two birdies at the back nine, both on short holes to close on one under and the day’s 71 for a two rounds total of two over par 144, which gave him a two shots lead from day one leader Mathew Wahome, who dropped seven shots in the second round including two at the par three-18th where he three putted from 25 feet for a 77 and a two rounds total of 146.  Like Nduva, Wahome had started with a birdie at the opening hole though he later bogeyed the fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth and the 13th hole.  He pared all the way to the 18th where he barely made it to the green, left his first putt half way, and missed the two more to picked a double.  It was not a good day for the Tanzanian Victor Joseph either as he double biogeyed the eighth and 13th in addition to a couple of other single bogeys for eight over par 79 and a total of 151.  He needs a very low score in today’s final round revived his chances of claiming the title.  A total of 93 players are participating in the event being sponsored by Mayfair Bank, Grain Bulk Hundlers and Shikara Limited.

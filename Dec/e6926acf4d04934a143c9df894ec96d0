Coffee chain Java House has opened a branch at the Total Station near the Imara Daima turnoff on Mombasa Road, its 64th branch since the restaurant began operations. Java’s latest branch is the second to open in a span of two weeks, following the unveiling of its 63rd branch on Monrovia Street, opposite Lifestyle Mall earlier in the month. The Sh50 million branch comes in the wake of Java’s strategic expansion plans which involves opening at least a branch or two every month. In November, Java opened an express joint inside the United States International University (USIU) premises, the first branch within a learning institution.

Dubai-based private equity firm, Abraaj Group, recently acquired the chain house, buying the stakes held by founder Kevin Ashley and Washington-based Emerging Capital Partners in a multi-billion shilling deal.

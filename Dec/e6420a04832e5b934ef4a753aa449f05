Kenya's Ismael Changawa on Sunday stunned top seed Duncan Mugabe from Uganda in straight sets to lift the Karen Open Championships title at the Karen Country Club. The 21-year-old Changawa, who is based in Louisiana, United States, tore through Mugabe with strong serves and returns, winning 6-0, 6-2 to the delight of fans as top class tennis returned at Karen courts for the first time in three decades. "I didn't expect the final to be that easy but that shouldn't be misconstrued to imply that I didn't work hard for the victory…I really played well," said Changawa, who is a third year Sports Science student at Louisiana University, USA. Changawa said he is pleased with his game that has improved greatly since moving to the USA three years ago.  “What slowed my progress this season was the knee injury but I am now fit,” said second seeded Changawa, who tossed out fellow countryman Ibrahim Kibet in the semi-finals 6-3, 6-2. It was Changawa's fourth victory against the Ugandan, coming only a fortnight after he triumphed 6-2, 6-4 during the Rwanda Open final in Kigali. Mugabe, who was forced to dig deep before dismissing Abdoul Shakur Kabura from Burundi 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in the semi-finals, described the final as his “worst ever performance.” "I want to say sorry to my fans for not showing up strongly as expected. I just shouldn't have played the way I did," said Mugabe, 27. "This was one of those days a player faces...I couldn't make any good first serve since my mind, body and spirit were not there." Changawa later partnered with Kibet to win men’s doubles, beating Mugabe and Kenya’s Sheil Kotecha 6-3, 7-6(8) in the weeklong competition that was sponsored by Rent Works Asset Leasing Company. Gabonese Cellestine Avomo rallied in the last set to edge out a stubborn Aisha Niyonkuru from Burundi in straights sets of 6-1, 7-5 to lift the women’s title. Avomo and Kibet would partner to win the mixed doubles contest, beating Kabura/Niyonkuru 6-4, 7-6(3) in the final.

RIO DE JANEIRO A far-right Brazilian party on Friday denied reports that World Cup-winning footballer Ronaldinho is to be one of its candidates in elections for the Senate. "There is no agreement between the party and Ronaldinho for him to launch a bid for a Senate seat," the party, Patriota, said. Patriota is led by Jair Bolsonaro, a firebrand former army officer dubbed the "Brazilian Donald Trump" who is riding high in opinion polls ahead of next year's presidential elections. O Globo's website reported Thursday that former Barcelona and Paris Saint-German star Ronaldinho was to run for a seat in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais. The article showed a photograph of Ronaldinho with Bolsonaro, with the footballer holding a copy of a book by the politician. Patriota's president Adilson Barroso said: "He is not a member of our party, but the door is open and it would be an honour to have him with us." Ronaldinho, 37, won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil.

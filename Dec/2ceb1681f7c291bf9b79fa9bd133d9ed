Following the burial of Kitui West MP Francis Nyenze, succession plans are in the offing, with residents trying to identify a capable leader to take up the baton. During the burial of the politician at his home in Kyondoni, Kitui West constituency, most leaders from the region appeared to endorse his widow, Edith Vethi Nyenze, as the best bet for the parliamentary seat. Mrs Nyenze is currently being portrayed as the most likely candidate to win the seat due to the key role she played to ensure her husband’s victory in the August 8 elections.  WIPER She conducted vigorous campaigns across the constituency to make sure her husband won, even at a time when he was seriously ill and in hospital in Nairobi. Mr Nyenze, who vied on a Wiper Party ticket, emerged the winner after garnering 21,136 votes, with his closest rival, Robert Mutiso Lelli of Ford Kenya, getting only 6,525. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu said that following her long friendship with Mr Nyenze, she would ensure his wife gets a direct nomination ticket from her party — Narc. This move by Mrs Ngilu seems to be a tactic to outsmart Wiper in wooing Mr Nyenze’s wife to her party and boost its popularity in the region.  This comes after she beat former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe of Wiper in the last General Election. However, Mrs Ngilu’s move might not be taken well by the Wiper leadership, which is not keen to see the seat go to another party.  Wiper is, therefore, likely to front another stronger candidate and campaign vigorously to ensure it retains the seat.  The fact that Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua and Mrs Nyenze are siblings is likely to reduce her chances of winning the seat, unless the issue is handled well.  Residents of Matinyani and parts of Mutonguni may not want to have another lawmaker from the Wambua family.

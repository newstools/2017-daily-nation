Four people have been put in an isolation ward at Mt Kenya Hospital Nyeri after been suspected to be infected with anthrax. Nyeri Central sub-county commissioner John Marete said the two brothers and their two neighbours from Thunguma village are reported to have eaten uninspected meat in Ruiru, Kiambu County before travelling to Nyeri on Friday. Mr Marete confirmed that the patients presented themselves at Nyeri Referral Hospital on Saturday morning and were immediately transferred to the health facility after screening. “They went to the county hospital in the morning and were immediately transferred to Mt Kenya hospital. They are receiving treatment at an isolation room since Anthrax is a contagious disease,” said Mr Marete. He added that public health officers have been mobilized and dispatched to the village to assess the situation and investigate if there could be other possible cases. “We want to find out how they contaminated the disease and if there could be other possible victims who are yet to present themselves in hospital. The medics are controlling the homestead,” he noted. The commissioner however assured the public that the situation is under control.

Arsenal legend Thierry Henry will be in Kenya from December 15 to 16 to conduct football training camps with four community clubs in Nairobi. Henry, who is Arsenal’s all-time leading goalscorer with 228 goals in all competitions, will visit Kenya in a trip organised by Guinness under its ‘Made of Black’ programme.  “Henry will hold a football clinic for coaches from the teams and later advise players on how to progress in football as a profession, Guinness Kenya Marketing Manager Nduku Wamakau said.  “Kenya has so much football talent. However, many times players miss out on the guidance and career advice that can take them to the next level. We believe this camp will be an eye-opener for players who want to grow to become professionals,” she added. The teams comprise upcoming players selected from different parts of the country through a talent development programme.  The players will have an opportunity to showcase their skills in a game officiated by Tabitha Njoroge, the only female referee in the Kenyan Premier League.  The football camp is part of activities organised by Guinness aimed at bringing football closer to the community.  Guinness has partnered with Henry in a programme dubbed ‘Guinness Made of Black programme’ to celebrate the unique passion of African football fans.

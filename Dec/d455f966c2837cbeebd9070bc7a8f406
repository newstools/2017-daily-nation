Foreign investors have accounted for a larger share of trading turnover at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) in the past three weeks as local funds take a back seat during the festive season. Market data compiled by Standard Investment Bank (SIB) shows that foreign participation in equity turnover has averaged 75 per cent in the period, up from an average of 56 per cent in the preceding one month.  This year, the foreign investor share of turnover stands at 63 per cent. Analysts say that there is reduced activity from local institutional investors, leaving the bulk of trading in the hands of foreigners and local retail investors.

The SIB data shows that the most popular counters for foreign investors remain the blue chips such as Safaricom, EABL, KenolKobil and KCB.

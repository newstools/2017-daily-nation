ABUJA At least 20 Boko Haram members have been killed and an assortment of weapons recovered during an operation by the Nigerian Army, official said. The Army Deputy Director of Public Relations, Col Timothy Antigha, on Wednesday said the soldiers arrested 17 members of the sect and rescued 100 of their captives. BOKO HARAM Col Antigha said the operation against the insurgents was possible because of the support of the Nigerian Air Force. The operation, tagged DEEP PUNCH 2, was designed to smoke out the Boko Haram terrorists inhabiting remote islands on Nigeria's Lake Chad basin. “The operation, which commenced about two weeks ago, was proceeded by coordinated air and artillery bombardment of islands and localities occupied by terrorists, and from where they sneak into Magumeri, Kauram and other locations to loot property and attack security personnel and villagers,” said Col Antigha. INVESTIGATIONS Preliminary investigations, he added, revealed that a large number of those rescued were held against their will and forced to work on farms under life-threatening conditions. "More investigation and interviews will be conducted before the rescued persons are handed over for further action,” he said. Weapons reportedly recovered from the terrorists include 3 Toyota Land Cruiser Gun Trucks, 5 AK-47 Riffles, 3 Fabrique Nationals (FN) Riffles, 2 G3 Riffles and 1 Pump Action Rifle. Col Antigha disclosed that six soldiers sustained injuries and were evacuated for treatment. 
  
The killings were carried out by Boko Haram insurgents, ethnic militias and bandits.

Seven prison warders at the Siaya GK Prison have been interdicted after an inmate escaped on Thursday evening. Nyanza Regional Prisons Commander Amos Misik said the officers are believed to have helped the criminal to escape. INVESTIGATIONS Francis Musyoka Mutuku, a former police officer, was serving a life sentence. The duty officer (overall inspector in charge of the shift), sergeant in charge of shift, the sergeant in charge of compound, sergeant in charge of the block, the gate keeper of the block and two officers in charge of the watch tower would be required to explain how the inmate escaped. Mr Misik said the decision was arrived at after they sought the services of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, who helped identify them. He said that the DCI informed him that the prisoner escaped “following laxity of some of the officers". ‘DANGEROUS’ Mr Misik urged members of the public to help the police in arresting the Mutuku as he is a danger to Kenyans. The prisoner was an ex-GSU officer who was arrested following a spate of murders and robbery with violence incidents in Kisumu, Vihiga and Siaya towns, and has a pending case in Embu. "The suspect is armed and dangerous and should be in prison. We call upon the members of the public with credible information about the suspect to present it to the police and help re-arrest him," said Mr Misik. FOILED ESCAPE The prisoner had initially been jailed at the Kodiaga Maximum Prison and was expected to appear before the High Court in Siaya for an appeal case challenging his current sentence. The Prisons official said Mutuku had previously attempted to escape at the Siaya GK Prison in 2014. "In 2014 the suspect was unlucky as he attempted to escape through cutting the fence only for him to be caught … his two accomplices escaped," said Mr Misik.

The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations (Cecafa) Senior Challenge Cup begins this weekend in Kakamega and Machakos. At least nine countries will participate after five others — Somalia, Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Djibouti and Sudan — withdrew. Kakamega and Machakos counties went out of their way to renovate their facilities in time for the games that Kenya last hosted in 2013. But challenges abound, such as security, accommodation and travel. The government and Football Kenya Federation (FKF) must ensure Kenya redeems itself from the losses and ridicule it suffered after it was stripped of the rights to host the 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN). The host and visiting teams must feel safe and well taken care of. The Stars should take advantage of the home crowd to excel. We exhort local football enthusiasts to turn out in large numbers to cheer the teams. Most important, this is the time to test the stewardship of the new Harambee Stars coach, Paul Put. May the best team win.

Suna East MP Junet Mohamed could find himself in police cells again after police investigators promised a magistrate that they will arrest him for skipping court summonses. The Directorate of Criminal Investigation sought more time to look for the MP over a case that he was charged in July.  ARREST WARRANT Homa Bay Director of Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Joseph Tuksho through criminal investigation officer Patrick Kibowen told senior Principal Magistrate Susan Ndegwa that he was not aware that the court had issued warrant of arrest to Mr Junet. “Mr Tuksho has not been aware that the court issued warrant of arrest to Suna East MP Junet Mohammed,” said Mr Kibowen. The criminal investigations officer said they will execute the order, “We ask for more time to enable us arrest Mr Junet,” said Mr Kibowen. Mr Junet appeared in a Homa Bay Court in July and was charged with ethnic contempt for remarks he made during an ODM youth meeting in Homa Bay town.  Mr Junet was accused of uttering words which were contravening the National Cohesion and Integrity Act in a political gathering which was attended by Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, Homa Bay Woman Representative Gladys Wanga and other leaders. The meeting in which Mr Junet is accused of speaking the inflammatory words was called by ODM Party to stress the importance of voting for Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga. He was accused of ordering governor Joho to prepare grounds in Mombasa where the opposition coalition will conduct swearing in of Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga in a move which will see Mr Odinga becomes president of certain parts of the country except Central region. He was released on bail but ordered to appear in court on October 24 and which prosecutors claimed he failed to show up. The case will be mentioned on January 11 next year. 
  
The Suna East MP said the officers did not give him the reason for his arrest.

Mr Mungai is accused of killing Faustine Mwadilo Mwadime on the evening of December 6 at the Chiromo Lane Medical Centre in Nairobi’s Westlands area.He was first arraigned on December 8 amidst outcry from the Kenya National Nurses Union over the shooting. He then requested the court to be allowed to seek medical attention. HEAD WOUNDThe suspect is a licensed gun holder and on the fateful day, he had been rushed to the medical centre by a relative. He allegedly started shooting at the nurse minutes after refusing to surrender his gun to the hospital’s security personnel.

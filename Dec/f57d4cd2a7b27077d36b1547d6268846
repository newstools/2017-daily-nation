The Teachers Service Commission has banned more than 41 teachers from working over misconduct. Chief executive Nancy Macharia said the deregistered teachers will not be allowed to teach in any school in Kenya – whether it is public or private. DEREGISTERED Forty of the banned teachers are male. Reasons given for their deregistration range from desertion of duty, having sexual relationships with students, insubordination, negligence, exam cheating and embezzlement. However, most of the teachers are being kicked out of the profession for having sexual relations with their students. SEX WITH STUDENTS Last year, 22 teachers who had sex with their students were banned from teaching in Kenya. In 2015, some 126 teachers were deregistered due to misconduct – 100 of whom were accused of having sexual relationships with their students. “Further, it is notified for general information that pursuant to Sections 30 (4) & (5), 23 (2) of the Act: Where the name of a teacher is removed from the register of teachers, such a person shall not be reinstated except by direction of the Commission,” said Dr Macharia.

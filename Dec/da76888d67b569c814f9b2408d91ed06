PRAGUE The former Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund star Tomas Rosicky sprung a surprise on Wednesday by announcing that he has played his last game of professional football. The 37-year-old played 105 times for the Czech Republic, and spent a decade at Arsenal where he was known for stylish passing and slick skills. "I have never played either for the money or the glory - I just love football," Rosicky, who appeared at four European Championships finals, told his club Sparta Prague's website.  "But I have realised I am no longer able to fully prepare my body for what the professional football requires," the injury prone number 10 said. "I would like to thank Sparta for raising me, for being the first step in my career in big clubs, and for allowing me to say goodbye at the place I love the most," Rosick√Ω said. "I've had a lovely career despite all the set backs, I have known both wonderful and difficult moments," he said.

A fire on Sunday evening razed the Armed Forces Canteen (AFCO) at the Embakasi Garrison, destroying property worth millions of shillings. The fire, whose cause is yet to be established, started at 4pm and consumed the entire canteen, which also serves as a store and mini-market. LOSS Military spokesman Col David Obonyo said the fire was put out using military equipment. He said the canteen was closed at the time of the fire and nobody was injured. The canteen is usually closed on Sundays. "The gate personnel noticed the fire and notified the fire fighters," Col Obonyo said. Although other military personnel estimate the loss at tens of millions, Col Obonyo said the exact cost will be evaluated later. On Sunday evening, military police were combing the area for clues of the cause of the inferno.

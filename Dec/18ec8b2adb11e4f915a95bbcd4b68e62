LUSAKA Zambia is set to relaunch a national carrier in partnership with the Ethiopian Airlines, the government has announced. “Cabinet has approved the re-establishment of the long-awaited national airline at an initial estimated cost of $30 million,” Transport minister Brian Mushimba told journalists. AIRLINE The long-awaited national airline was finally incorporated and will operate as Zambia Airways 2014 Limited, which will be a successor of the defunct Zambia Airways. Zambia Airways was liquidated in 1994 and since then, the southern African country has had no national airline. The Zambian government will be the majority shareholder in the partnership, Mr Mushimba said. SURVIVED Zambia Airways ran broke largely due to patronage and abuse by the political establishment. Zambia Airways was founded in 1964 as a subsidiary of Central African Airways. Ethiopian Airlines was launched in 1946, and distinguished itself as a pioneer in African aviation industry. It has outlived the various governments that have ruled Ethiopia over the years.

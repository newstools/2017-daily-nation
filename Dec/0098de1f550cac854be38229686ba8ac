The government is under sharp criticism over the continued loss of lives on roads. The Central Organisations of Trade Unions (Cotu) on Wednesday said the government should treat road safety with the seriousness it deserves. 'NO ACTION' The government, Cotu boss Francis Atwoli said, should deal with corruption among Traffic Police officers and step up vehicle inspection. Mr Atwoli, in a statement, said there are areas that have been marked as blackspots but the government has failed to take any action. “I also call upon the government in their infrastructure development plan to include urgent and immediate measures to combat accidents on our roads,” he said. He also proposed the construction of a dual carriage way from Ngata area to Mau Summit—  a stretch on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway where many accidents occur. “Further, it should be a top priority for government to construct dual carriage highway of the entire Nairobi-Eldoret highway based on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s agenda on infrastructural development,” Mr Atwoli stated. At least 16 people died in a horrific crash on Jamhuri Day at the Sachangwan–Salgaa blackspot bringing the number of those killed in under 24 hours to more than 40. “The Late Mama Lucy Kibaki had proposed a dual carriage at Salgaa and Sachangwan after deadly accidents during Kibaki’s government, this has never been realized,” said the Cotu chief. He asked motorists to observe traffic rules, especially during this festive season.

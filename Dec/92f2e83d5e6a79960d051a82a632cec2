Home player Dennis Saikwa fired in a total of six birdies at the tough playing Royal Nairobi Golf Club course during Saturday’s final round to claim the 2017 Uhuru Shield golf title. The off-scratch Saikwa, who won the Nyanza Open title two weeks ago, birdied the second, fifth and sixth at the outward nine and at the 14th, 15th and the par three-17th for a clean six under par 66 that gave him a three rounds total of 218 gross, to beat Limuru’s John Karichu by seven shots. He had made a slow start firing six over 78 in Friday’s opening round, though he managed to recover four shots in the afternoon’s second round to bounce back to the leader board going into Saturday’s final round. On the other hand, Karichu dropped a number of shots in the final round for a 77 and a total of 228 to tie for the second place with South Africa based Mathew Wahome, who carded 78 in the third round. Taking the first round gross on one over par 73 was John Kariuki of Limuru after beating Jay Sandhu, while Mike Kisia and Edwin Mudanyi both from Vet Lab claimed the second and third rounds gross on 76 and 73. In the nett section, Mathew Wahome 228 took the overall title with a score of 228 nett, beating Raphael Leming’ani by one shot on 229 nett.  The first round nett went to Jackson Mwangi on 74 and Peter Musila on 75 won the second round, while the third round title went to Frank Munyuah of Ruiru on 71 nett.

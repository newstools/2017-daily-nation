Members of the newly-formed National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) Fundraising and Marketing Commission have promised to deliver on their mandate to pay back the confidence bestowed on it by local sports federations. One of the Commission’s members, Mohammed Nyaoga, who is also the chairman of Central Bank of Kenya’s board of directors, said it was a great honour for them to bestowed with the task of mobilising resources for the benefit Kenyan sportsmen. Nyaoga said the commission will formulate structures to make it easy for it to persuade companies to sponsor Nock teams.   “We shall form a resource management strategy and give ourselves timelines for raising funds,” said Nyaoga. “Ours will be a collective responsibility geared towards delivery since this team is composed of professionals with diverse skills and knowledge to propel the commission to achieve its mandate.” Nyaoga was speaking Friday in Nairobi after Nock president unveiled the commission. Other members of the commission are Barclays Bank of Kenya Marketing Director Caroline dung’u, Architectural Association of Kenya chairperson Emma Miloyo and Patrick Obath, who is a trustee at Kenya Private Sector Alliance. Others are lawyer Donald Kipkorir and IMG Communications CEO Peter Gacheru. Nyaoga noted that Kenya has suffered a setback in preparing teams for major championships owing to poor governance and lack of accountability.  “There has been poor planning and misuse of resources and this has kept potential sponsors away for fear of reputational risk,” Nyaoga said. “We shall cultivate different culture of openness and transparency to attract sponsors.” Tergat said the team will meet to pick its chairman, adding that its mandate will stretch to 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The commission is tasked with putting in place structures to help Nock raise funds to fund its programmes and teams.

Companies operating in Kiambu County will be compelled to employee 70 per cent of locals if a proposed law is implemented. The Kiambu County Employment Bill 2017 is already causing jitters to investors in the area. Governor Ferdinand Waititu said all factories, estates and public institutions will be required to adhere to the law to help the county create jobs. He said the proposed law will serve to absorb at least 50 per cent of unemployed people in Kiambu County. “The proposal is perfectly in conformity with Section 65 of County Governments Act that requires county governments to ensure at least 30 per cent of public positions are filled by people not from the dominant ethnic community in the county,” he said.   The 70 per cent, he added, is therefore “an exclusive share” for residents. “We are going to table the law in the county assembly and pass it. And I will sign it into law. We cannot be talking about our commitment to create jobs yet we are doing nothing to grab the opportunities in our county,” he said.

Two children died in a mysterious fire on Friday night as they slept in their shelter in Kisumu's Milimani Estate. Brian Oduor and Carlos Oneya, aged five and six years, were asleep in a makeshift house when it caught fire. BURNT The boy's uncle Zedekia Owino had escorted them to the tin house, some 30 metres from their parent's main house. Mr Owino said the fire broke out less than 10 minutes after he had put the boys to sleep. “At around 9.40pm I left the main house to sleep after escorting the boys to the makeshift house. We saw the whole house was on fine,” he said. “I had left the boys inside with the door slightly pushed. By the time we put out the fire, we realised the door was locked from outside.”   The cause of the fire could not be established immediately. After the fire was put out, Brian and his younger brother Carlos were found clinging to each other under a bed, their bodies burnt beyond recognition. TORCH Their father Jonathan Oduor said the cause of the fire was unclear. “There was no candle or kerosene lamp in the house. In fact, my brother used the torch on my phone [for light] to escort the boys to sleep,” said Mr Oduor.   The police came to the scene at 11pm and took the bodies to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary. The police said investigations are underway to ascertain the cause of the fire.

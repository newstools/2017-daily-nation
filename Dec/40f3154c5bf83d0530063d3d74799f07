Birthday party preparations for a nine-year-old boy were cut short after he committed suicide after losing in a children’s game of cards. Silas Charo hanged himself in his room using a rope. The Standard Three pupil was playing with his friends in Mtondia Village in Kilifi County when he lost the game. The Mtondia Primary School pupil killed himself on Saturday at around 11am, missing his birthday celebrations due next week. The last born in a family of four was turning 10, said his father, Mr Erastus Charo. “His mother had told me of her plans to buy him a cake and all the preparations were set only for me to get a call that he had committed suicide,” said Mr Charo as he fought back tears. CRYING He said the child went home crying after he lost the game.  His mother was cooking when he arrived at the house. “His sister was sleeping in their room but went out leaving the boy and that was when he hanged himself,” narrated the father. The boy was mad after he lost the game which is played with cards with each of the player having cashew nuts which are surrendered to the winner.  “His friends refused to give him back his cashew nuts when he requested for them even after he lost the game. I wonder why he decided to kill himself. Everyone is shocked here,” Mr Charo said. SUICIDE Kilifi OCPD Alexander Makau confirmed the incident, adding that they are treating the matter as suicide as they continue with their investigations. “The information we have is that the boy committed suicide as he was found hanging in the room but our investigations are on to establish what exactly happened,” said Mr Makau. The body was taken to Kilifi Hospital mortuary, he said.

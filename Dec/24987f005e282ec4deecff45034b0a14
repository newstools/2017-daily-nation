Are you a fan of poetry in its essential form, before spoken word broke through the scene? Are you a poet or aspiring poet who thinks your works have what it takes to get published? There’s a new event in town that starts this Tuesday evening, December 5, at Kengele’s Lavington titled “Booze My Muse” from 7.30PM onwards. This premiere gig will feature the likes of ProfAlfred Omenya as the main act, Tazim Elkington, Stanley Mitoko and philosopher Mwange Ifedha. It will also feature two talented artistes Grand Master Masese & MC Sharon. The event is the product and brainchild of award-winning writer and poet Adipo Sidang’ and Stanley Mitoko. WILL APPEAL TO NEEDS OF POETRY LOVERS “The event involves poetry reading and performances, spiced with afro-fusion and traditional African music.   It's meant to appeal to the needs of poetry lovers. It's not spoken word but poetry, the latter which is publishable. We shall publish an anthology from poets who will be participating in the event. It's basically our way of making poetry accessible to poetry lovers through readings and performance. It shall have performances twice every month, on the first and third Tuesdays, at Kengele's Lavington. We will be inviting different poets to take part in the event. We also have book signing and will use the platform to promote young poets who hope to publish their poetry. Again, not spoken word but Poetry in the strict sense,” says Adipo. With even the invitation being poetic, it will be interesting to see which and how poets in Nairobi rise to this call: “Come booze your muse. Come booze as you ride your muse. Come muse as you booze your muse...or just come and get drunk with VERSE.”

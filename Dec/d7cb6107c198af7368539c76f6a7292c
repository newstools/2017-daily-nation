As the festive season picks up, Kenyan rumba fans will this week be entertained  by both local and foreign musicians at various live concerts.Paris-based Congolese rumba sensation Kabose Bulembi is expected to arrive in Nairobi next Tuesday for a series of shows.   Kabose, who was formerly with General Defao’s  Big Stars Band and Orch Wenge Musica Maison Mere, will stage his first show at the  popular Deep West Resort Club , Nairobi, on  Friday.  His second show will be  on December 11  at Mamba Village Centre in Mombasa.

Speaking to the Sunday Nation recently, Mr Kabose expressed desire to visit Nairobi and team up with his idol, General Defao. During his stint with Werra Son’s Orch Wenge Musica, Mr Kabose  in the early 2000s, featured on various tracks and in live shows with the sensational Kinshasa-based outfit that also nurtured the mercurial Ferre Gola, who is revered in Kenya, for his hit song, Vita Imana and many others icluding Kamasutra.

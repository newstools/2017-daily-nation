Nation Correspondent, Yaoundé Cameroon is in mourning following the death of legendary footballer Benjamin Massing.  Massing, who rose to fame during the 1990 Fifa World Cup in Italy, died early Sunday at the age of 55. The former hard-tackling defender died in his native Edea town located in south-west Cameroon, family sources said.  The sources did not reveal the cause of Massing’s death. His death came as President Paul Biya presided over the Football Cup of Cameroon finals, which marks the end of the sporting season in the country.  Eulogies have been flowing on the social media following the death of Massing. His Cameroonian teammate at the 1990 World Cup, Emmanuel Maboang, eulogised him.  “Unbelievable. Rest in peace my Lion,” Maboang wrote.  Former Indomitable Lions striker and the former all-time top goal-scorer for the national team Patrick Mboma also paid a tribute to the fallen defender.  “We all have our heroes. It is hard to wake up and hear that one of them has gone. Today Benjamin Massing’s heart has definitely stopped beating. A Lion never dies, he sleeps! Farewell champion,” Mboma wrote on social media.  Massing, who played in France at Creteil, won 34 caps for his country between 1986 and 1992.  His death comes five years after that of Theophile Abega, who was widely regarded as one of Africa’s most skilful midfielders.

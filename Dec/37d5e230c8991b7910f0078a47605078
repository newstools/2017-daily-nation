Primary head-teachers, secondary school and college principals will no longer serve in their home counties, their employer says. The Teachers Service Commission on Tuesday said the managers would also not serve in one station for more than nine years. Chief Executive Officer Nancy Macharia said the new policy for delocalisation would improve cohesion of Kenya's diverse culture. In the new policy, head-teachers and their deputies will be required to possess bachelor's degrees, while principals and their deputies in secondary schools and colleges will be required to have a master's qualifications. Speaking during the official opening of the 13th annual primary school head-teachers conference in Mombasa, Dr Macharia urged the more than 12,000 managers to embrace the new policy which takes effect immediately. "Those who lack the required academic qualifications will be given time to go back to school," said Dr Macharia. The new policy will affect technical training institutes and teachers training colleges which they are about about 105. There are about 23,000 heads in primary schools and about 8,600 principals in secondary schools.   It seeks to equip learners with seven key skills.

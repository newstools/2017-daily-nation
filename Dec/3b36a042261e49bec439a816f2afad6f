The National Super Alliance (Nasa) team organising the planned ‘swearing-in’ of its leader Raila Odinga now says it is unsure whether to go on with the event in the absence of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who is in Germany. The team comprising ODM CEO Oduor Ong’wen, Koitamet ole Kina, Wiper CEO Jared Siso, Nasa strategist David Ndii and former nominated Senator Judith Sigeny announced at Wiper offices Saturday morning that it is faced with the challenge of “swearing in” Mr Odinga on December 12 and send judges to Germany to “swear-in” Mr Musyoka or have him take a few days to Kenya for the planned event. "Those are the options under discussion but by Monday we will be having the way forward," Mr Ong'wen said. Mr Musyoka is said to be attending to his wife who is unwell. The date for the Nasa event coincides with Jamhuri Day celebrations, an event that marks the day when Kenya became a republic. The team, unveiled by Nasa leadership to find a way to have coalition leader Raila Odinga declared the “people’s president”, said it is being intimidated by the government. The fear of a government crackdown is the reason the committee has no chairman. The organising committee unveiled of Friday last week is expected to come up with a plan to promulgate the people's assembly on December 12 through motions passed in 15 county assemblies.

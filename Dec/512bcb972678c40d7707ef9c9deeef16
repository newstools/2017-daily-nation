Diamond Platinumz could be courting controversy yet again after confessing that he does not regret cheating on his partner Zari Hassan with model Hamisa Mobeto. During an interview with BBC's Salim Kikeke, Diamond said the affair was bound to happen and he did not regret it even though it almost cost him his relationship with the mother of his two children. READ: All about Diamond’s women “Nafikiri chochote kinachotokea katika maisha, kinatokea ili kikujenge baadaye ujue wewe ni nani na upite katika njia gani. Na Mwenyezi Mungu anamjenga mtu katika njia tofauti, kila mtu anamjenga kwa njia yake tofauti. Huyu atampa mtihani huu ili kukomaza hichi. Kwa hiyo unapokuja mtihani hutakiwa kutetetereka, usisononeke hautakiwi kusikitika (I think everything that happens in life, happens to help you grow in future, and God has different ways of doing this. He can present you with a challenge to make you a better person so there is no need to panic, feel remorseful or sad)." Diamond, who acknowledged the affair after several months of denial, said the scandal has turned out to be a blessing in disguise. “Mi napotokewa na tukio nafikiri mara nyingi inaniongezea mashabiki na kuniongezea mauzo katika kazi zangu. Simaanishi kwamba inanifanya nifanye hivyo mara kwa mara lakini ni kwa kuwa mara nyinbgi yanatokea kiubinadamu na najua kuyahandle katika misingi ya kwamba haitatokea tena, au ikitokea basi ni Mwenyezi Mungu kapanga sio kusudi langu (Every time I am hit with a scandal it ends up increasing my fan base as well as music sales. That doesn’t mean that I willingly welcome controversy but it's human nature)."

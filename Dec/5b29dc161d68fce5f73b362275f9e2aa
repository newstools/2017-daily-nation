The Mombasa County Assembly has debated and passed a motion sponsored by the National Super Alliance (Nasa) seeking to create a people's assembly. The ward representatives unanimously passed the motion on Wednesday.  The assembly becomes the 11th to adopt the motion. The motion was moved by Majority Leader Hamisi Mwidani who is also Mtongwe ward representative. Mr Mwidani said it is time for the people to liberate themselves through the people's assembly. LEADERS  "As a people, we have been taken through a hard time by computer generated leaders. We want to take the responsibilities to the people so that we can deliberate together and tackle the issues affecting us," said Mr Mwidani during the debate which was also attended by deputy governor William Kingi. He said the motion is aimed at correcting the mistakes done by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in the August 8 and October 26 presidential elections. The MCA added that adoption of the motion in the county was a way of forcing a repeat presidential election before or on February 2018. Airport Ward Representative Ibrahim Bomoa said the formation of peopleâ€™s assembly will give room for election reforms and ensure votes of every Kenyan counts. Deputy Speaker Fadhili Makarani said Governor Hassan Joho has been facing hurdles in fighting for the rights of Mombasa people and the formation of the people's movement will make things easier for him. The MCAs said it was through the people's power that the marginalised communities will get proper share of national cake. Mjambere Ward Representative Fahad Kassim said it was sad that Mombasa was not the first County Assembly to pass the motion adding that "it is better to late than never."

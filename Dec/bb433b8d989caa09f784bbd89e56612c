On form Dismas Indiza produced a bogey-free brilliant round of six under par in the closing round at the excellent par 72 Sigona Golf Club course to claim the Captain’s Prize pro title in great style Friday. The long-hitting Indiza, who seems to be in his best form at the moment, set off for the day by picking up a birdie at the second, a birdie which propelled him to two more birdies at the sixth and ninth. Turning to the back nine, the Mumias Golf Club-based Indiza eagled the par five-15th and added one more birdie at the 17th to complete a 54-hole total of 12 under par 204, his best three rounds score in three years.  “I have been putting a lot of hours on my game to bring myself to shape for the 2018 season,’’ said Indiza, who is, however, still trying to get a sponsor to enable him play in tours such as Sunshine Tour next year. He beat home pro John Wangai by a total of 12 shots as Wangai carded two over par 74. The round included three single and one double bogey, having earlier birdied three holes at the front nine. The final round was a tough one for Anil Shah who dropped a number of shots in the final round for a 76 to drop to third place on 217.  Out going Sigona Golf Club captain James Mbuthia invited over 40 professionals including some from Uganda, though only 30 of them turned up for the event whose amateur section gets under way Saturday with a huge field drawn to vie for the amateur title.  Meanwhile, away at Royal Nairobi Golf Club, home player Jay Sandhu shot one over par 73 to tie for the opening round with former Kenya Open amateur champion John Kariuki of Limuru.  The two started the afternoon second round with one shot advantage from John Karichu of Limuru, Vet Lab’s Edwin Mudanyi and Robinson Owiti and Railway’s George Felix.  Four others tied on four over par 76 and they included South Africa based Mathew Wahome, who is back home for next week’s Nyali Open, which is the grand finale of the national calendar.

Details have emerged on Al-Shabaab’s new tactics to attack security camps in areas earmarked for the ongoing multi-agency security operation dubbed 'Linda Boni' in Lamu, Tana River and Garissa counties. The operation was launched in 2015 to flush out Al-Shabaab terrorists from Boni forest and neighbouring areas. In an exclusive interview with the Nation, security officers manning the area said the terrorists were using women as spies in areas targeted in the operation. Those who spoke to the Nation in Galmaghala, Ijara, Bodhei, Milimani, Basuba, Mararani, Ishakani and Kiunga villages said they had been forced to send the women out of some villages after discovering they were sent as spies and to plan attacks. “We are extra cautious nowadays. We have on several occasions chased away very beautiful women whom we suspect of being spies of Al-Shabaab.  "They always target villages that closely border our camps. They have tried establishing a close relationship with us while others are even willing to become lovers of some officers,” said a GSU officer who requested anonymity. He added: “We, however, became suspicious of them since any time the women are seen, barely two days would go by before we are attacked by Al-Shabaab.  "We have decided not to entertain them any more. We suspect they are agents sent to try and confuse us and get information.” 
  
The soldiers ambushed the militants and some Shabaab members escaped with bullet wounds.

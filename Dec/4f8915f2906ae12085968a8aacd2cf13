The national soccer team, Harambee Stars, deserves congratulations for doing the country proud by winning this year’s Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations tournament. The Stars edged out Zanzibar 3-2 in a thrilling penalty shootout after the two teams battled to a 2-2 draw in regulation time in Machakos Town. The Stars have now registered their seventh regional success, and the first since 2013. It is also a good start and a morale booster for new head coach Paul Put, who has been in charge for only a month. We hope the victory will act as a catalyst in the preparations to resume the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers campaign in March. CRUCIAL POINTS The Stars may have lost crucial points in their 2-1 defeat to Sierra Leone, away but there is still some hope. However, they will have to up their game, considering that the group has superior sides such as Ghana and Ethiopia. The last time Kenya qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations was in 2004. We hope Mr Put and his team know what to do. The Stars need to boost their preparations and uplift their standards if they hope to win their remaining matches. Football Kenya Federation must ensure that the Stars train under the right atmosphere devoid of  hitches such as delays in payment of allowances. The right facilities and quality friendly matches will be crucial if the much desired results are to be realised.

Detectives from the anti-graft agency have arrested two court officials in Nyeri on allegations of soliciting a bribe of Sh25,000. Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) regional director Jackson Mue said the detectives arrested the Judiciary executive officer and a court clerk at the Karatina law courts. BRIBE He said the two women had promised to bail out a night guard who was facing theft charges. “The executive officer had offered to assist the complainant [guard] have the matter withdrawn on condition that he gives her Sh25,000. The complainant reported the matter to EACC Nyeri Central Region for assistance and a sting operation ensued,” said Mr Mue. He said the money was recovered from the executive’s table drawer in her officer and a further Sh47,000 was also found in her handbag during the search. INVESTIGATIONS “The extra money was concealed in a handbag and we suspect it was also proceeds of corruption and crime. Investigations are ongoing on the matters to establish the circumstance under which the money was being given out,” noted Mr Mue. He said the executive officer and the court clerk were arrested at the court premises and escorted to Nyeri Central Police Station where they were released on a bond of Sh50,000 each. The suspects will be charged in court upon completion of the investigations.

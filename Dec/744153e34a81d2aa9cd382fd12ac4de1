PARIS Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has returned to the French capital and will train on Thursday after being allowed to visit his native Brazil on family matters, the Ligue 1 leaders said Wednesday. The world's most expensive player will miss Wednesday's French League Cup tie at Strasbourg, after also sitting out last weekend's 3-1 win over Lille through suspension. PSG coach Unai Emery said on Monday that Neymar had gone home because of a family problem and that he hoped the former Barcelona star would be back in "three or four days". Amid speculation over the reasons behind Neymar's trip, Brazilian website Globoesporte published social media messages accompanied by photographs which suggest the player could have been at the birthday party of his friend's father and had also visited a dental clinic. On Monday, Neymar published a photo of himself on Twitter with the message: "Focus, strength and faith for the celebration of another day!!" PSG, who are bidding for a fifth successive League Cup title, lost 2-1 to Strasbourg in the league 11 days ago.

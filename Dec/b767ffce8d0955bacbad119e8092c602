The NGO council has asked National Super Alliance (Nasa) leader Raila Odinga to reconsider his decision to be sworn in as the people's president. Instead of escalating the power struggle, Mr Odinga should reach out to President Uhuru Kenyatta, NGO Council of Kenya Chairman Stephen Cheboi says. STABILITY According to Mr Cheboi, Kenya already has a sworn-in president and leaders on both sides of the political divide should help the country heal and move forward. “A united Kenyan nation is very important for us all East Africa region and the Africa continent at large,” he said. President Kenyatta and deputy President William Ruto were sworn in on Tuesday in a ceremony attended by thousands of Kenyans and dozens of foreign leaders at Kasarani, Nairobi. But Mr Odinga, who boycotted the October 26 repeat presidential election demanding overhaul of the electoral commission, has vowed never to recognise their election victory and government. He has embarked on a broad resistance campaign in and out of Parliament, including economic sabotage, aimed at what he terms “electoral justice” . MANIFESTO Mr Odinga, who is under immense pressure from his supporters to give them direction, recently said he will take oath as the people’s president on December 12. But Mr Cheboi faulted the move, saying leaders should allow the country to heal after a protracted political conflict that claimed more than 60 lives. “All Kenyans should note that we can only have one president at a time and for now the office is occupied based on the recent processes,” he said. He said the country is facing various challenges which can only be addressed through dialogue— including tribalism, corruption, unemployment, poverty and access to basic services. “We urge the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta to immediately settle down and start implementing their manifesto,” he said on Thursday.   It was also revealed that the President and Mr Ruto have been appraising CSs.

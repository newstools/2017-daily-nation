Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko has directed the Directorate of Criminal Investigations to release National Super Alliance (Nasa) strategist David Ndii on police bond. Mr Tobiko has also asked the police to do their investigations and forward the inquiry file to him. By 5.30pm Monday, Mr Ndii who was arrested in Kwale and interrogated at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations Headquarters, had not been charged. He was taken to the Milimani Law Courts at 2.30pm, but remained at the basement cells. Police said that they were planning to detain him at the Muthaiga Police Station. The Nasa chief strategist, who was accompanied by lawyer James Orengo, was driven out of Milimani Law Courts to Muthaiga Police Station at about 5.40pm Monday by CID officers. Other lawyers present included Edwin Sifuna, Apollo Mboya and Waikwa Wanyoike. Nasa leader Raila Odinga has termed the arrest of the coalitionâ€™s strategist, Mr David Ndii, as a wider scheme by the government to intimidate Kenyans fighting for electoral justice. 
  
Nasa and police give conflicting reports on arrest of the economist in Kwale.

A section of politicians from Meru County have come out to defend Land Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi after a group of Njuri Ncheke elders called for his sacking. Led by North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood and Meru County Assembly Deputy Speaker Elias Murega, the leaders also urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint two more Cabinet secretaries from Meru and Tharaka-Nithi counties. Addressing Journalists in Meru Saturday, the leaders said Prof Kaimenyi should be given a chance to perform even better.  “It is wrong for people to ask the President to drop CS Kaimenyi. We want to request him and his deputy to appoint three cabinet secretaries from Meru and Tharaka-Nithi,” said Mr Dawood. The MP said the two posts in Meru should include Prof Kaimenyi while another slot should go to Nyambene region. “We request the President to retain Prof Kaimenyi because he has performed and we believe he can perform better. He has been able to spearhead issuance of title deeds and he has done digitisation of the registration process,” he said. The leaders also requested Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi to intervene and push for reappointment of Prof Kaimenyi to the Cabinet. However, Njuri Ncheke Chairman Linus Kathera and Secretary Josphat Murangiri said Prof Kaimenyi has nothing to show for his tenure in Education and Land ministries, and would hold demonstrations if he is reappointed. They said the President could appoint any other professional from Meru and Tharaka-Nithi to the Cabinet. 
  
Lobbies also urge Uhuru to appoint more ministers from the region, especially Tharaka-Nithi.

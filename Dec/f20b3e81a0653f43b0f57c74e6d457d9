A protest by Sonko Rescue Team members against a media house which reported that they had not been paid for eight months was Wednesday broken up by police. Led by their chairman Morris Mutua and chief officer Joab Ogolla, they marched towards Royal Media Services offices, off Dennis Pritt Road, but were dispersed at the Hurlingham roundabout. Citizen Digital reported on Tuesday that 120 of the youths had camped outside City Hall demanding payment from Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko. Mr Sonko immediately denied the claim. “We were marching to Citizen to ask them the source of a fake story they ran on Tuesday,” said Mr Mutua.

A political lobby has suggested that President Uhuru Kenyatta appoints to the Cabinet performers who are loyal to him and whose selection will not cause cracks in their regions by igniting controversy. Speaking in Kiambu Town, Mount Kenya Youth Caucus Chairman Linford Mutembei said that will unite regions and ensure Jubilee achieves its development and political agenda. This, he argued, will boost the party’s unity and support and ease Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. “For instance, Mount Kenya region has had Mwangi Kiunjuri, James Macharia and Prof Jacob Kaimenyi, whose appointments did not stir up controversy because they were welcomed by the majority, and continuation of the same will help keep the region united,” said Mr Mutembei. FREE HAND While noting that the President and his deputy had a free hand to pick whomever they want, he, however, added that the positions should be fairly distributed in all regions. According to Mr Mutembei, some individuals eyeing the positions only want to return to power after losing in the recent General Election while others intend to use the positions as a launch pad to their 2022 bids but not to deliver.

Diamond Platinumz's mother Sanura has rubbished claims that she is a sugar mummy despite being seen with a man her son's age. In an interview with a local Tanzanian station, Sanura is seen showing off her wedding rings in an attempt to confirm her marriage to the 28 year old man. The grandmother of five seemed vexed by comments online that the man is too young for her. “Ana udogo gani? Hana udogo yule, angekuwa mdogo asingeoa (What do you mean he is young? He isn’t young, if he was, he wouldn’t have married me)." She also announced plans to have a baby with her new man: “Naseeb (Diamond) atapata mdogo wake siku yoyote, au nyie hamtaki mdogo? Basi subirieni mdogo wenu wa mwisho (Naseeb will get a sibling soon or don’t you want him to have a brother?)"

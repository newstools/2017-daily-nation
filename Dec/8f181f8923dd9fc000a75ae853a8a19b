After qualifying for next year’s SportPesa Premier League, Wazito FC are now targeting to finish in the top 10. Club chairperson, Kentice Tikolo, believes the team, founded in 2011 by former students of the University of Nairobi and members of staff, will be seeking to send out a message to other teams in the top flight that their promotion was no fluke. But he says lack of sponsorship is what is likely to derail his ambition in the Kenyan Premier League next season. “If you are looking for a brand to support, then Wazito is definitely the brand,” Tikolo said. “We have a lot of talented players and the passion is there. They have been resilient against teams with stronger financial muscles despite our limited resources. They have been so focused.” The team, second in the National Super League this year, has been producing exciting talents, among them Harambee Stars trialist Joe Waithira. The players have been going through programmes aimed at sensitising them on matters to do with life after football. The club has also partnered with Penthouse where players go for their gym sessions. They alsao have a nutritionist who advises them on matters diet. “We are focused and ready to rumble. Our aim is to finish in the top 10 next year to make our promotion worth,” Tikolo added. While congratulating the players, coach Frank Ouna said they have already identified a few players who they want to sign. “It’s an honour that we managed to qualify to the top,” an elated Wazito coach said after their last match against Kenya Police. Tikolo said the team is committed to help the growth of football in Kenya, through nurturing talent.  Since 2011, the club has moved up four tiers. The team was knocked out of the GOtv Shield quarter-finals by AFC Leopards this year, a feat that Ouna believes helped the team in their quest for promotion.

The Kenya Motor Sports Federation has extended the term for its Rallies Commission chairman for a further two years. Supi Soin, who has been at the helm of the local motor sports governing organisation for the last two terms, says he will continue with his assignment until the end of the 2018 season, when he will call it a day.  “It has been a difficult but rewarding task in trying to improve the status of the Kenya National Rally Championship series which includes the Safari Rally. The national competition rules are much stronger and clearer with stringent organizer obligations. My goal is to get a WRC candidature event by 2019,” said Soin. NO PROTESTS “In the last four years, there have been no driver protests during any rally where a driver had stopped within a competitive stage and refused to continue. There were no protests on any times given for flying finishes as we had introduced policing at each of the FFs,” he added.  “With my team, we have taken rallying from open roads which was dangerous to 75 per cent private land and 25 per cent totally closed roads making rallying safer." The Safari Rally, which lost its World Rally Championship status in 2002, is on course to return to the world series.

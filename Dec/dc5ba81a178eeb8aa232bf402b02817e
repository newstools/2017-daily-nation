The Kenya squad to the ICC Under-19 World Cup set for New Zealand from January 13 to February 3, was presented with a full kit by national governing body at Sikh Union Club, Nairobi Friday.  The playing gear was presented to the players by Cricket Kenya chairlady, Jackie Janmohamed. She said each member of Kenya’s contingent to the World Cup will have a green blazer, white shirt, a tie bearing CK colours and a pair of trousers, tan in colour. “The boys are representing the country in the World Cup, they therefore must look presentable,” the cricket boss said.  She also revealed that the Permanent Secretary (PS) for Ministry of Sports, Peter Kaberia, will meet the team on Tuesday at the Sikh Union Club.  On the other hand, the Kenya Under-19 coach, Jimmy Kamande, said that they will close camp Saturday for Christmas and reassemble on Tuesday at Sikh Union ground. He also said that they will leave for Australia on Thursday where they will play two friendly games against a Sydney side before they fly to Christchurch, New Zealand.

Police in Mombasa have launched investigations into the theft of valuables belonging to Nairobi County Assembly officials. According to the police, three laptops belonging to an assembly clerk assistant and two nominated MCAs were stolen from a hotel in Bamburi. The officials were among a 17-member team that was attending a conference at the hotel. However, an MCA who spoke to Nation said four laptops and four phones were stolen. He said the theft happened when they had gone for lunch. “When we came back, we did not find the laptops, including that of the facilitator,” he said. “We suspect it was an inside job as the hotel is well-guarded and it is not easy for one to just get in and pick up items.” Mombasa police boss Johnston Ipara said officers were working with the hotel management to establish who committed the crime. “We believe there are CCTV cameras at the hotel. We will review the footage and see what happened,” said Mr Ipara.

BERLIN Bayern Munich said Thursday they had signed experienced German international striker Sandro Wagner from Hoffenheim as backup for Robert Lewandowski. German press reports said Bayern paid a fee of around 13 million euros ($15.4 million) for the 30-year-old. "We are convinced that Wagner will improve the quality of our team with his class and his experience," Bayern's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic said. Wagner's contract runs until June 30, 2020. Polish international Lewandowski has complained about a lack of rest.

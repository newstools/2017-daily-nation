An officer at Mwariki Police Station in Nakuru Town is on the spot over allegations that he sexually harassed a 19-year-old woman who was being held at the station. Police say they are investigating allegations that the officer demanded sexual favours to secure the orphan's release. OUTRAGE According to the woman’s guardian, she was arrested on Monday for allegedly being found drinking alcohol outside the stipulated time. “The girl was in the company of a friend and they were heading to a relative’s funeral meeting at the neighbouring Free Area Estate when she was arrested. I got information from her friend later that she was held in Mwariki Police Station,” said the guardian. Police took up the matter after it was shared on social media by activist Boniface Mwangi. It sparked public outrage, with social media users demanding the immediate arrest of the officer.

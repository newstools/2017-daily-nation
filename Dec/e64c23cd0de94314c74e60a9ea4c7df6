Daystar University has been closed following a students’ protest that began last month. Vice-Chancellor Timothy Wachira Friday said the semester would be completed in January next year. “The opening date for the January 2018 semester will be communicated in due course,” Prof Wachira said in a statement to students. Graduate students were begin their examinations on December 4 while undergraduate and diploma tests were slated for December 11. The university was to end its academic calendar on December 20. THE BIBLE On Friday, students who have been pushing for Prof Wachira’s removal, protested the decision to send them home, saying they should have been told of the closure early. The university on Monday suspended a number of students for two weeks. “The student’s handbook encourages a biblical approach in settling of grievances. Students are discouraged from engaging in action that may obstruct learning, teaching or research,” Deputy Vice Chancellor, James Kombo said in a letter to a suspended student. “Involvement or participation in any of the above could lead to disciplinary action. The handbook also provides for immediate suspension of students found to have contravened the code of conduct, pending investigations.” Last month, the university was closed for almost a week when students protested poor meals and the administration’s decision to increase tuition fees without consulting them.

There is an aura of holiness about Bollywood film personalities. Not that they are associated with some godly mission but the artistic credentials bestowed upon them by the make believe empire of India puts them on a pedestal of great esteem.  People and fans love them and even go as far as to worship them as idols. Whenever these idols of worship make an appearance on our stage or in a gathering, it becomes nothing less than a revered celebration. Last week our media both social and print joined Bollywood fans to celebrate the arrival of Indian screen idol Kareena Kapoor Khan.  The Bollywood “apsara” made a whirlwind stopover in Nairobi to walk the ramp for her friend and internationally acclaimed fashion designer Manish Malhotra and grace an exclusive fashion extravaganza showcasing Manis’s creations. The event was organised by Ranee Productions. The Bollywood idol having delighted and blessed her fans, returned to Mumbai the following day to fulfil her professional assignments and together with her husband actor Saif Ali Khan, make preparations to celebrate the first birthday of their son Teimur.  All praise to Ranee Productions for facilitating an opportunity for fans to be blessed by “darshan” of the most revered Bollywood Apsara. And one just cannot help to carry on singing praise for the recently concluded dance brought to us by the High Commission of India Nairobi. The Urafiki Utsav or the Festival of Friendship featured classical dance Kathak and traditional Gotipua. It was a heavenly opportunity to witness young boys dressed as females performing a dance ritual in praise of Lord Jagannath and Krishna. The performers at Oshwal Auditorium transformed themselves into graceful feminine dancers and brought to life the age old dancing ritual performed in the temples of Orissa to please the heavenly beings. 
  
Often accused of ripping off plot lines from Hollywood, it was perhaps only a matter of time before India's Bollywood launched its own "Walk of Fame"

Home players clinched top honours as the SGA Kenya Junior Open Tennis Championship came to an end Wednesday at the Nairobi Club.  Roselida Asumwa, Edmond Nyabwari and Cynthia Cheruto all won their respective finals as the curtain came down on the four-day showpiece which attracted players aged between 12 and 18 years from five African countries. However, Tanzania’s Kantui Alagwa and Gabon’s Ella Avomo prevented a Kenyan clean sweep as they clinched boys’ Under-14 and girls’ U- 18 titles.  Asumwa was first up in court in girls’ U-14 final against Tanzania’s Ester Nankulange. The home player battled to a 6-3, 7-6(5) success after almost 77 minutes on court to win Kenya’s first final. Asumwa attributed her success to her fighting spirit and resilience amidst great pressure. “It feels great to end the year on a winning note and it shows the improvement I have had through the season,” Asumwa said.  The first set was rather straight forward as Asumwa capitalised on her opponent’s error-strewn serving to take a commanding 4-1 lead after five games. Nankulange rallied to win the next two games and bring the score to 4-3 but was punished for her bursts on the net as the Kenyan took the first set. The second set was more dramatic with Nankulange fired up to take the game to her opponent. Asumwa held her nerve to clinch the title. Edmond Nyabwari had no such trouble in boys’ U-12 final as he saw off compatriot Neville Otieno 6-2, 6-3 to be claim the title. In girls’ U-12 final, top seed Cynthia Cheruto had to wade off a strong second set fight back from Shana Mao winning 6-3, 7-5.  Tanzania’s Kanuti Alagwa beat Kenya’s Mwendwa Mutuku 6-1, 6-4 in boys’ U-14 final as Avomo beat kenya’s Angela Okutoyi 6-3, 6-3 in the girls’ U-18 final.

Hi Brenda,  I first commend you for your good advice in your column. There is this girl in the same college as I am and we have been dating for 11 months. She has a part time job as a model as this is what worries me as a lot of men lust after her body which she parades for all and sundry. We haven't had sex yet and she claims she is a virgin but I don't know if she is telling the truth because she has dated other men before me. Of late her behaviour has become strange and when I confided in a close friend about my concerns I was told she has been seen with another man outside college.  Is she playing games or should I believe her and continue to pursue this relationship. Please help. Almy, Nairobi  Hi Almy, Thank you for your kind words. You have been with this girl for close to a year so it is obvious you like her.  I cannot attest to the truth about her virginity but what you must realise is that relationships are based on trust. If you ask her and she says she is a virgin, then believe her until you have proof that says otherwise.  You will need to confront her about your suspicions of another man but if she denies it, believe her until you can prove her wrong.  One of the worst things you can do in a relationship is listen to the friends around you and base your decisions on their statements. Tread carefully. The relationship is between the two of you so if you have issues with your girl, she is the one to talk to, not your friends. *** Do you have a problem for Brenda?

We also talk about marrying and our future together but I feel guilty about falling in love with someone's girlfriend.

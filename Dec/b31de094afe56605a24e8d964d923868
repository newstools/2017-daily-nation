Former Lari MP Mburu Kahangara lost his pistol, cash and other valuables after gunmen raided his home in Runda Mumwe, Kiambu County. The five gangsters even had time to eat a meal and drink a bottle of wine inside the house. The gangsters, who were armed with three pistols and other crude weapons gained entry into the former lawmaker’s home at around 1 am as he arrived home accompanied by his wife. According to Mr Mburu, the thieves terrorised then for about three hours as they ransacked the house before making away with cash, mobile phones, electronics, clothes and jewellery.  They also took the former MP’s firearm that was hidden in a safe together with two magazines loaded with ammunition. The robbers went into the kitchen where they ate Chapati which had been prepared by the family, and also drunk a full bottle of wine which they found in the couple’s bedroom.  Mr Mburu said the gang accessed his residence after cleverly creating a space through the compound’s electric fence. During the incident, Mr Mburu’s wife Monica suffered bruises on the face as she shielding her husband from being stabbed by the thieves. After the gang left, Mr Mburu reported the incident at Kiambu Police Station.

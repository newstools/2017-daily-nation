Headteachers have been ordered to ensure pupils do not repeat classes. Teachers Service Commission chairperson Lydia Nzomo said although teachers have been put on notice over class repetition some children are still made to repeat classes. “A child should complete one class and go to the next. We must offer quality education for all our children,” Dr Nzomo said. While speaking during the ongoing primary school headteachers annual conference in Mombasa, Dr Nzomo assured the teachers that they will not be demoted following the government directive that management of primary and secondary schools sharing a compound will be merged. NO DEMOTION “You won’t be demoted from a head teacher to a classroom teacher, we have protected you from all that, just do your work, ” Dr Nzomo said. She said the government will continue exploring other ways of ensuring teachers are well remunerated. The Collective Bargaining Agreements have brought relative peace in the education sector, she added. “Which is critical for achieving quality education. Did you notice the helicopter promotion from job group G, H to N? We should embrace quality education reforms. If the learners are not healthy and nourished, they won’t concentrate,” she said. SAFE SPACES At the same time, Dr Nzomo urged the school heads to provide a safe environment for learners. She urged the school heads to protect pupils from physical, social, sexually and psychologically abuse. “I know we do not have enough teachers in all the schools but during recruitment ensure they are well trained to offer the best for our children,” she added.   Employer says most of the recruits will be posted to county schools next year.

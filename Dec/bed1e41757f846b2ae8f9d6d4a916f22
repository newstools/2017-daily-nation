The world on Sunday marks the United Nations Human Rights Day, which has added significance this year with activities leading to the 70th anniversary celebrations in 2018. This was the day, in 1948, when the UN  General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For Kenya, this is an appropriate time to remind ourselves of the inalienable social, cultural, economic, civil and political rights and freedoms. The country has for the better part of this year been tested — the shrinking space for exercising civil and political rights exemplified by the killing of civilians, including innocent children, by the police. HUGE DEBT As we join the world in honouring the timeless gift to humankind, it should be a time for those in power to take time and reflect, not just on the significance of the day, but, more importantly, to acknowledge the huge debt owed to future generations to make the world a better place for all. In commemorating this day this year, Kenyans – both leaders and ordinary citizens – should heed  the call by UN Secretary General António Guterres for people “everywhere to stand up for all human rights – civil, political, economic, social and cultural — and for the values that underpin our hopes for a fairer, safer and better world for all.” The Human Rights Day should be a time for reflection for those in positions of responsibility and power — including politicians and the security forces — and ordinary Kenyans.

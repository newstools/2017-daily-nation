Taita Taveta University has been closed indefinitely after the ongoing strike by lecturers disrupted learning at the institution. The decision to close the university was reached by the Senate on Wednesday. A memo signed by acting registrar acting registrar Dr Meshack Pongah said next semester opening dates will be communicated in due course. “It is not possible for learning to continue even if the strike is called off now because they have wasted a lot of time,” The institution’s public relation officer George Kasamani said. “We will probably resume learning in January because the time left is not possible to do anything meaningful or complete the semester comprehensively” The students have been out of the institution since October 26 when the repeat presidential election was conducted, he added. “Before they could come back for their normal learning the lecturers began their strike. Only students who were graduating came back last week for the ceremony,” said Mr Kasamani.

Private companies have been urged to work with Nairobi County in its efforts to improve education standards. The County Executive for Education, Janet Muthoni Ouko has said areas like health, sports and sanitation, play key roles in providing a conducive environment for learning, and this can be enhanced through private public partnerships. “At the county government, we are keen to establish long lasting, long term private public partnerships. We have partnered with Ecobank to equip Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital in the area of health,” said Ms Ouko at County Girls High School in Ngara, Nairobi at the weekend. During the event, Ms Ouko unveiled two high capacity water tanks that were donated to the school by the financial institution. She also donated textbooks to the students. A new dormitory that was converted from a classroom was also painted by some of the bank employees and the students. Ecobank has contributed a total of Sh4 million to the school to help in the provision of clean water, sanitation and learning materials. Ms Ouko was the chief guest at the school during the fifth Ecobank Day, a day the bank sets aside once every year for their corporate social responsibility. “We are delighted that with the provision of the high capacity water tanks and refurbishment of the common sink, general hygiene for the children will be greatly improved,” said Ecobank Kenya Managing Director Samuel Ashitey Adjei.

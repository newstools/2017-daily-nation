WASHINGTON A top US newspaper on Wednesday blasted President Donald Trump with a withering editorial, saying he was not fit to even "clean the toilets" in Barack Obama's presidential library or shine George W. Bush's shoes. USA Today, a mass-market paper with one of the biggest circulations in the country, published the piece after Trump attacked a Democratic female US senator in a crude tweet. "Will Trump's lows ever hit rock bottom?", blared the headline of the piece from the paper's editorial board, which excoriated the president for saying Senator Kirsten Gillibrand used to come to him "'begging' for campaign contributions... (and would do anything for them)." "With his latest tweet, clearly implying that a United States senator would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, President Trump has shown he is not fit for office," the editorial said. "Rock bottom is no impediment for a president who can always find room for a new low," added the paper, which is not usually known for hard-hitting editorials. "A president who would all but call Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand a whore is not fit to clean the toilets in the Barack Obama Presidential Library or to shine the shoes of George W. Bush," it said, referring to Trump's most recent predecessors. The editorial went on to list a number of what it saw as Trump's transgressions, including his support for scandal-tainted Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, as well as his false and misleading statements, divisiveness and ethical lapses. Gillibrand branded Trump's tweet as a "sexist smear."

There was simply no freezing X-Factor (Lesley Sercombe), from icing down the Santa Claus Reindeer straight. As a triple nap selection, X-Factor left Espionage and Crixus dangling from a string. The Prancer Maiden, full of raw recruits, went slightly awry when Echo planted totally, and, Top Notch ditched Michael Micino while breaking from from her stall.  Flamboyant had no competition to dally with as Kournikova and Impala were seriously too green for comment Good to have Dreamliner finding the Lord McMillan Cup before Navy Seal could think.  Trained by Oliver Gray for owner Richard Baudry, Dreamliner should be given a Knighthood as a consistent placer.  Oliver did not rest on any laurels. His River King stormed through later, to wedge the Brigade of Guards 2,800m, from Notorious. Patsy Sercombe enjoyed a rare feat as Clothes Horse and Fire Fighter actually dead-heated in the H.V. Pirie Guineas Trial. No worries for Mim Haynes as proprietor of both.   NGONG RESULTS 12.3pm - First Race - The Prancer Maiden (900m) 1. Flamboyant (Joseph Warari) 2. Kournikova (James Muhindi) 3.

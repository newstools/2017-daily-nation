SportPesa Premier League (SPL) side Thika United face National Super League (NSL) outfit Ushuru in the first leg of the relegation playoff Thursday afternoon at the Thika Sub County Stadium from 3pm. The reverse tie will be staged on Sunday at the Narok County Stadium with the winner earning a place in next season's top flight league. “The match is on as both teams have been informed to honour following the tribunal directive. We don’t anticipate any stumbling block again but should it happen, the decision will be made in reference to the match officials report,” said Football Kenya Federation (FKF) media boss Barry Otieno on Wednesday. The Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) on Tuesday dismissed Thika United’s petition challenging the playoff that was earlier scheduled for December 6 and 10.  Both FKF and the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) agreed to have team finishing in 16th place in the KPL play the third ranked team from final National Super League (NSL) standings in a two-leg playoff with the aggregate winner joining the top tier. Thika, who finished 16th on the KPL log with 35 points, sought a temporary injunction via lawyer Wahome Njagi at the High Court on December 5. SDT chair John Ohaga directed Ushuru, who came third in the NSL with 78 points, be enjoined as interested parties with Ken Ochieng’ and Ms Akong’a appearing for FKF and KPL as the 1st and 2nd respondents. “The upshot of the foregoing is that the application and the petition are dismissed. We direct that the petitioner meets the costs of the respondents and interested party on a full indemnity basis. "It shall also be responsible for any wasted cost occasioned by the postponement of the playoffs,” read the ruling delivered and signed by Ohaga. Both teams last met in the 2016 top flight season, playing to a 1-1 draw in the first leg in March, Thika won 1-0 in the second leg in October.

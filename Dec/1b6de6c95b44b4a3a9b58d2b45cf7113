Eighteen hours after Saturday’s WBC World Super Bantamweight title bout pitting Kenyan boxer Fatuma Zarika against Zambian Catherine Phiri, Zarika’s younger brother Musa Mohammed will lead Kenya onto Bukhungu stadium pitch for the opening game of this year’s Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup. This is a responsibility the Gor Mahia skipper is arguably best suited to perform considering his profile which includes four SportPesa Premier League titles, and vast continental experience that have among other things, earned him 20  international caps. Kenya will play Rwanda from 2pm in the opener, while Tanzania and Libya will lock horns in Machakos in the other game of the day, and the 26 year old told Nation Sport he harbours the dream of leading Kenya bag the seventh regional title. “The ultimate aim is to win the title. The bar is high, the last player who captained Kenya in this tournament on home soil lifted the title,” the soft-spoken 26-year-old recalls. “But we have to first think about Rwanda, to play well in the opening match, get that win then see how things go from there.” Mohammed is expected to lead a rearguard that will also consist good company, teammates Boniface Oluoch and Wellington Ochieng in defence, with the evergreen Joackins Atudo and youngsters Bernard Ochieng and Isaac Kipyegon considerable alternatives. At the same time, teams continue in Kakamega yesterday for the nine-team regional competition. According to Football Kenya Federation’s NEC member for Western Tony Kweya, Ethiopia’s Walya Antelopes and the Swallows of Burundi are already in Kakamega for the championship. Harambee Stars and Rwanda’s Amavubi expected to join them on Saturday.

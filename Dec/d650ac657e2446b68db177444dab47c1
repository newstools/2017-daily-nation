The government launches selection for next year’s Form One students on Monday against a backdrop of a drive to transit all Standard Eight candidates to secondary school. Access and transition challenges have defined our education system for years and efforts to deal with them conclusively are creditable. Form One selection is itself bedevilled with various challenges such merit, diversity and fairness. Until recently, many qualifiers failed to get schools of their choice and other still did not get any chance at all. Part of the problem was quota system that locked out many qualifiers from accessing schools of their choice. TOP CANDIDATES However, this has since been settled with the declaration that all top candidates — those with more than 400 marks — will get admission to national schools of their choice irrespective of whether they were in public or private schools. While acknowledging the differences between public and private schools in terms of facilities and modes of teaching, it is unfair to punish excellence just because of the type of school one sat the exam. In itself, that is discriminating and kills the spirit of hard work and merit. Form One admission also brings to the fore the question of quality and status of secondary schools. Part of the task the government must embark on quickly is renovation and expansion of secondary schools and cleaning up their management. In sum, let the selection be done fairly to ensure all candidates get schools they deserve. Ministry should also rein in those who extort money for Form One places.

This is a particularly good season for the National Police Service, what with rare accolades for a job well-done. Interestingly, it is not long after officers who have done exemplary work were feted, receiving not just trophies, but also words of encouragement from their seniors. While the police do a demanding job in dire conditions, what gives the service a really bad name is the conduct of the few rotten apples among them. Receiving recognition this time are not just the officers, but also police stations. Whereas suspects are innocent until proven guilty by a court of law, conditions in some stations are so appalling that being held there as one awaits the verdict of an investigation amounts to punishment for an offence that has not been proven. YIELD INTERESTING RESULTS A study by the Independent Policing Oversight Authority has yielded interesting results, which should encourage the heads of stations and their juniors to do their best to make them more habitable. Nairobi’s Buru Buru Police Station, for instance, has been declared the best facility for an inmate to be held at. It has some conveniences such a modern toilet. We hope this is just the beginning and that those recognised will be motivated to do even better, and that this will spawn competition to improve these facilities. After all, even convicts deserve their human rights and locking up suspects in filth is not just a shame; it’s an abomination.

Seven herders were Friday shot dead and five others injured during a raid at Kuori dam on the Isiolo- Marsabit border. The attackers also stole about 900 cattle. Police reports indicate that at least 100 attackers from Rendille and Samburu communities ambushed Borana herders from Merti in the morning. Isiolo Police Commander Charles Ontita said the death toll and number of casualties could rise as they are yet to receive information from their counterparts in Laisamis, Marsabit. Tension is high in the area following the attack. The police boss said cattle raids in the area had increased as raiders are on a mission to restock their livestock after drought. “Our officers sent officers to the area last week to reconcile the communities after animals belonging to herders from Merti went missing on Wednesday,” said Mr Ontita. Among those injured in the Friday raid was a son of a chief who was shot in the stomach. The injured are admitted to Merti Sub County Hospital.

Nairobi County workers have threatened to go on strike if their salary demand is not met by Tuesday next week. The decision was arrived at during a meeting attended by the county workers union representatives and Nairobi county government officials on Thursday. A standoff between Kenya Revenue Authority and City Hall made Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to transfer funds from the county government’s account to KRA so as to cater for arrears of up to Sh1 billion. Speaking to Nation, Nairobi Branch county government workers union Chairperson Bernard Inyangala said City Hall officials gave them an assurance that the money will be availed by Tuesday next week. He said the county government promised to borrow money from treasury if need be, to pay workers, but insisted they will strike on Wednesday should the county fail to keep its promise. “The county government has until Tuesday next week, after that, we will lead a mass protest by all workers to demand for our money on Wednesday,” said Mr Inyangala. The workers will march to treasury to demand Sh65 billion which the national government owes the County government in parking fees, land rates and other services they receive from City Hall, said Mr Inyangala. He said the stalemate between KRA and the county government was affecting the welfare of workers, who have no part in the dispute. Nairobi union branch secretary Boniface Waweru said the county was exploring legal option on the matter.   Governor accuses taxman, CBK of colluding to frustrate county.

Voting in the repeat of Ainabkoi Jubilee Party parliamentary nominations has kicked off at Munyaka Primary School polling station. The exercise started at 6 am on Saturday after area MP Samuel Chepkonga filed an appeal claiming that the results of the last primaries were inflated at the said polling station causing him to lose. The National Assembly Legal Affairs committee chairperson lost to his opponent Mr William Chepkut during the party nominatios by a margin of 129 votes. Mr Chepkut, a long time personal aide of former powerful Kanu-era Minster Nicholas Biwott garnered 13,685 votes while the MP got 13,556 votes. In his appeal, Mr Chepkonga claimed that some polling stations, among them Munyaka were left open until 3 am on the nominations day yet they were supposed to be closed at 5 pm. The Munyaka polling station has 7, 000 registered voters up from 5, 700 in the 2013 register. The exercise kicked off peacefully Saturday morning. A contingent of anti-riot police officers was deployed to the polling station to maintain law and order. Some of the voters however alleged that their names were missing in the register. "Despite waking up to exercise my democratic right, my name is missing in the register and I feel disappointed," said Mr Luka Maina, a resident of Munyaka.

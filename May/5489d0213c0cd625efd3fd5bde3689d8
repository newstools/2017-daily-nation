A chief in Mandera County was killed Monday night by Al-Shabaab terrorists. County Administration Police Commander Suleiman Rashid said the attackers raided the chief's homestead in Omar Jillo township at 10pm and shot him dead. Mr Suleiman said the slain chief was instrumental in intelligence gathering on Al-Shabaab operations in the area. The officer denied reports that two police reservists were missing after the attack. “We have all our police reservists accounted for and nobody else was injured in the attack except the chief,” Mr Suleiman said. Seisal Gaiye, Arabia Ward MCA aspirant and brother to the chief, called on the government to bring the killers to book, saying it's not the first attack targeting his relatives. “Who killed the chief? We want to know,” he said on phone. “A few months ago, my uncle who was an officer attached to the governor and another chief were killed in area near the border,” he said.

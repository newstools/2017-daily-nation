When the political competition between Kiambu Governor William Kabogo and his friend-turned-foe, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, escalated, the latter vowed to not only kick out the governor, but also ensure all his allies followed him. And when Mr Waititu kicked off his spirited campaign, he publicly fought Mr Kabogo s backers, and asked the electorates to vote out anyone who was not in his camp, which was later named United for Kiambu.The streetwise politician even invented a slogan that he used in his rallies. The slogan, which left little doubt as to its meaning, went: Rita riri turacina nyoka na matumbi mayo (This season, we are cremating the snake and its eggs).WAITITU'S CAMP In Mr Waititu s team was former adviser to the presidency on agriculture and food security James Nyoro, who is Mr Waititu s running mate, and renowned preacher David Ngare, popularly known as Gakuyo.The others are politician John Mugwe - who is making his debut in elective politics - and Aquiline Githendu - who unsuccessfully vied for the senate seat in 2013.Beside the governor and his running mate, the team had its preferred candidates for the Senate, woman representative, MPs and ward representatives who accompanied Mr Waititu in all his rallies.For the Senate seat, the team had Karungo wa Thang wa as its candidate, who was to dislodge incumbent Kimani Wamatangi, while radio host Gathoni Wamuchomba was the candidate to oust Anna Nyokabi in the woman rep race. WAMATANGI SURVIVESMr Wamatangi was running an independent campaign while Ms Nyokabi, who is President Uhuru Kenyatta s cousin, was in the same camp as Mr Kabogo, which had former Limuru MP George Nyanja running for the senate seat.While other county leaders who were not in Mr Waititu s camp were handed embarrassing defeats, Senator Wamatangi defied the political wave that swept out nearly 90 per cent of the elected leaders in the county.Mr Thang wa failed to dislodge Mr Wamatangi who is now sure of re-election, as a Jubilee ticket is as good as a win in the region.Mr Wamatangi garnered 206,282 votes to beat Mr Thang wa who got 178,814 votes. It s a big thank you to the people of Kiambu for offering me another opportunity to work for them. I don t take it for granted. It means that you believe in me and you are happy with what I have done as your senator. I promise to maintain the pace and above all, the respect that I have for you, said Mr Wamatangi.VICTORS He added: Kiambu people have demonstrated that they have picked or rejected leaders based on their track records. The other MPs who survived the political hurricane are Moses Kuria (Gatundu South), Francis Waititu (Juja), Jude Njomo (Kiambu Town), Kimani Ichung wa (Kikuyu), Alice Ng ang a (Thika Town) and Paul Koinange (Kiambaa).Mr Waititu, the Juja MP, was the only Kabogo-leaning legislator who was among the MPs who won the hotly-contested Jubilee primaries. email print email print

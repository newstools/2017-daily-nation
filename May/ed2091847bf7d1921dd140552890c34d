Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu has called on residents to go for early cancer screening to reduce deaths due to the disease. Governor Mruttu said the disease can be managed or cured if detected early. "Early detection is the only secret to cancer treatment, we can reduce it if we regularly go for screening." "We have cancer screening machines in our hospital that can help in detecting the disease, you should not wait until it reaches an advanced stage whereby response to treatment is not positive," he appealed. The governor spoke during the requiem mass of Gertrude Mwangola, who was the wife of former Wundanyi MP Patrick Mwangola. Mrs Mwangola was one of the commissioners in the defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya (ECK) that was chaired by the late Samuel Kivuitu. Cancer still remains one of the leading killer diseases globally.

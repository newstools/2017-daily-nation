Murang’a Senator Kembi Gitura has claimed that his differences with Governor Mwangi wa Iria over corruption in the county cost him the Jubilee Party ticket, adding that he would not relent in his oversight role if re-elected. On March last year, the governor was arrested for obstructing Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission from searching his house. In November of the same year, he was grilled by the Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee over alleged corruption in a land-purchase deal. Mr Gitura, who is also Senate’s Deputy Speaker, vowed to push on with the war on graft. CREDIBLE POLLS Speaking to journalists moments after he was cleared to vie as an independent candidate by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Mr Gitura claimed he was rigged out of the Jubilee nomination. "I am a crusader against corruption and I have carried out that role very diligently to the best of my ability," he said. The senator said he is confident the August 8 elections will be free and fair. "I am satisfied...we will have free and fair election. There is no room for rigging, stuffing ballot boxes or voting multiple times during the elections," he said. Senator Gitura, who decamped from Jubilee to vie as an independent, said his efforts in fighting misuse of public funds are evident and that is why he is assured of being re-elected. SIX PIECE VOTING He criticised politicians advocating for six piece voting model, saying that would enable irresponsible leaders to occupy office. "There will [be] nothing like six piece voting in Murang'a. Voters will elect individuals not political parties," he said. More importantly, he said all candidates have an equal right to market their manifestos. In the county primary, he lost to Kiharu MP Irungu Kang’ata but rejected the results alleging widespread malpractices. Governor wa Iria said he will not back Mr Gitura accusing him of frustrating his administration.

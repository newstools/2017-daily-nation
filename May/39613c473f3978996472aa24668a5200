Prof Anyang’ Nyong’o has named Dr Mathew Ochieng Owili as his running mate as he seeks to become the second governor of Kisumu. The announcement was made at a hastily convened press conference at the Intercontinental Hotel in Nairobi yesterday. Prof Nyong’o said this was because of the speculation that had developed since he was confirmed the holder of the ODM ticket. WINNING TEAMHe described Dr Ochieng as a youthful, dedicated servant of the people, a professional, a man of impeccable character and unquestionable integrity. He said Dr Ochieng would be introduced in full later. A profile on LinkedIn identifies Dr Ochieng as a pharmacist. He hails from Nyakach. “With the people on our side and God watching over us, this is a winning team and I have no doubt about that. Anybody who doubts must wait until August 8 this year and the people will make a choice,” Prof Nyong’o said. RANGUMA'S TROUBLESAsked why he announced his choice in Nairobi rather than Kisumu, Prof Nyong’o said: “We will do it in Kisumu, too, on Friday next week, but we wanted to allay the anxiety of the press. "People were calling us almost up to midnight. At midnight, there are things I want to do that don’t include taking calls.” It had been speculated that he would select Ruth Odinga, the current deputy governor, but Prof Nyong’o said he had thought otherwise. “The mission to unlock the potential of Kisumu County is well on course and we maintain and we still say that that mission is possible,” he said. Prof Nyong’o could have an easy time taking the seat given that he has the ODM ticket, and Kisumu is an ODM stronghold. The locking out of Jack Ranguma, the current governor, from running as an independent candidate could also boost his case.

Lecture rooms at the Nakuru campus of Kenya Methodist University (KeMU) were deserted on Wednesday as students and lecturers kept away, following news of its closure alongside five others across the country. Students who spoke to the Nation said low enrolment was cited as the reason for the closure and they had been advised to move to the other open campuses. The closure has left students disgruntled and confused, with those about to graduate worried about their fate. In a notice seen by the Nation, the university management also dismissed more than 150 employees at the campuses. OFFICIAL DUTY Only a receptionist was on duty at the locked administration block at the Nakuru campus. She said the campus director, Dr Susan Chelang’at Nzioki, was away on official duty. “It is true the institution has been closed down,” she said. “I was instructed to be available until the end of August to direct visitors to the main campus [in Meru]. I’ve also been advising students.” Derrick Wanjau, a student, said: “We are required to move to the other campuses that are open, beginning of September.” The university branch is the only one in Nakuru County.

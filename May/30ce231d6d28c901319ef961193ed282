A 30-year-old mother of twins is nursing serious stab wounds on her genitals at Elwak Level 4 Hospital after she was stabbed by her husband, who accused her of infidelity. According to Elwak police station commander (OCPD) Charles Chahcha, Grace Kendi was attacked by her husband, Peter Mureithi, on Sunday. The police boss said, Mr Mureithi accused his wife of being unfaithful. “These two people have been living together as husband and wife but the marriage has been rocky due to what the husband said is the wife’s infidelity,” he said. Mr Chacha said the man had been arrested and will be charged in court on Tuesday on charges of assault and causing bodily harm. SPECIALISED TREATMENT A medical officer at Elwak hospital said Ms Kendi had been referred to Nairobi for specialised treatment. “We received her yesterday (Sunday) and stabilised her but we suspect she suffered a broken uterus that needs to be confirmed from a more equipped facility,” he said, requesting anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the press. The medical officer said the hospital lacked an operator for its ultrasound and X-ray machines. “We don’t have an expert to run the X-rays and ultrasound machines, meaning we can’t keep the patient here when we are not sure of her future condition,” he said.   A woman and her son are fighting for their lives at a Kisumu hospital after they were attacked by a man they called husband and father, respectively.

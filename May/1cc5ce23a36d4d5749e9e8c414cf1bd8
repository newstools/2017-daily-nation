The High Court in Nairobi has stopped the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) elections due for Friday at the Panari hotel.Kenya Tae Kwondo Association sought an injunction, stopping the process after the Centre for Multiparty Democracy-Kenya (CMD) barred them alongside Kenya Cycling Federation from taking part in the process.CMD had stopped the two federations from participating in the elections over factional wrangles.In an order issued on Thursday and signed by deputy registrar s office, the High Court gave a faction led by Suleiman Sumba and George Wasonga a reprieve when they stopped the elections pending a hearing on Monday, May 8.Nock deputy treasurer Stephen Soi and deputy Secretary James Chacha, who were among officials who were proposed by the two federations for re-election, were also technically locked out from Nock s polls that were to coincide with the General Assembly.Interestingly, besides CMD, the Sports Tribunal had also ruled against Tae Kwondo and Cycling after Rowing Federation filed a case with the Tribunal questioning the legality of the two federations, who had two factions each claiming office.The Tribunal also barred Anne Njambi and Geoffrey Shigoli from representing badminton at the General Assembly in favour of Peter Muchiri and John Mburu s group, further throwing the process into disarray.CMD had kicked out Muchiri s group from participating in the polls, reinstating Njambi s faction. Njambi was due to battle Elina Shiveka and Eliud Kariuki for treasurer s position.The tussle for power at Nock has divided federations into three groups; First Force, Second Force and Third Force. While they all support Tergat s candidature, the rest of the positions have been left open for all.The first force came into place when Tergat launched his bid where he unveiled his line-up. It had table tennis, judo, boxing, shooting, football, athletics, rugby, hockey, tennis and golf.However, not happy with some of the members in Tergat s line up in the First Force, a Third Force comprising Tennis, golf, volleyball, rugby, hockey, tae kwondo, cycling, basketball and badminton was born. The Second Force had only weightlifting and handball. Women representative Parvi Rawal and athlete representative Tegla Loroupe were in support of the Third and Second Forces respectively.Wrestling and swimming adopted a neutral stand hence those contesting saw them as the swing votes.It's now left to be known what kind of action International Olympic Committee (IOC) will take against Kenya after it had insisted that all federations that participated in the constitution review process participate in the election. Legendary long distance runner Paul Tergat, who is seeking the Nock presidency and athletes representatives Hellen Obiri and Humphrey Kayange, are the only people who were unopposed ahead of the elections. email print email print Chacha has been barred from contesting in the elections.

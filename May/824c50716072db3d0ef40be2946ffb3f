The United Kingdom is in mourning following yet another dastardly terrorist attack in one of its major cities, Manchester. The more than 20 people slaughtered were enjoying a concert and didnâ€™t deserve to die in this way at the hands of a suicide bomber. There have been similar fatal attacks in other UK cities, including London. The grim reality is that this is not going to be the last. And it just calls for increased vigilance, considering that the enemy is within and not easily identifiable. As a country that has suffered similar attacks in Nairobi, Mombasa, Garissa and other towns, and remote rural areas, we feel the pain of the British citizens. Indeed, we are dealing with a menace that knows no borders and whose deviousness is unfathomable. Just like in Kenya, the terrorist networks recruiting and radicalising the youth and sending them to carry out these horrific crimes pose a security nightmare that calls for greater co-operation among nations. Indeed, the security intelligence in the UK, Kenya and other countries have stepped up surveillance. However, the ease with which homegrown recruits are able to mingle with other people and access targets is a big challenge. As we mourn those killed by deranged people hiding behind a warped sense of religion, the resolve to defeat the terrorists must be intensified. The war on terror must continue.

The failure by the National Assembly to beat the deadline to enact laws guaranteeing greater participation of women in national affairs is a huge disappointment. The MPs, who are no doubt, now deeply engrossed in campaigns for the August 8 elections, have blown a chance to help the country comply with a constitutional requirement. High Court Judge John Mativo had given the National Assembly and the Senate 60 days to enact the laws to bring into effect the two-thirds gender law. This is the constitutional provision, which states that not “more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender”. At the core of this was an attempt to redress discrimination. DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT The judge has warned that the petitioners or any other person is now at liberty to petition the Chief Justice to advise the President to dissolve Parliament. The import of this is that the election preparations and campaigns could come to nought. It is disappointing that the country now finds itself is such a potentially untenable situation. The possibility of having to immediately go into another poll would have huge implications. It is a pity that while there appears to be broad support for efforts to enact the gender law in both the government and opposition circles, it has remained elusive and is like subverting the very Constitution the MPs purport to uphold.

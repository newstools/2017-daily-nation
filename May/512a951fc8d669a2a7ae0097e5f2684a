Taita Taveta County schools have started feeling the effect of new guidelines issued by the Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association after four were banned for irregularities. Boys’ Under-16 football favourites Mwandango Secondary and Cannon Kituri Secondary were thrown out of the ongoing championships in Taita Taveta as was Bura Girls’ Under-16 team due to what  county sports secretary Joseph Ndalo termed ‘massive irregularities.’ Also thrown out was the Cannon Kituri Secondary’s netball team who fielded imposters. Ndalo said Mwandango Secondary’s Under-16 football team had nine overage players, while Bura Girls’ football team had two ineligible playersa. Cannon Kituri Boys’ football team also fielded imposters, same as their girls’ netball team. The terms will now stay in the cold for one year while the teachers in charge have been banned from KSSSA activities for three years. “We did thorough investigations and detected were serious anomalies thus the decision by the executive to ban the said schools,” Ndalo, a teacher at Mghallu Secondary in Wundanyi, said.

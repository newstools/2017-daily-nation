Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has told off Nasa leaders over their threats to disrupt this year's elections if presidential results will not be announced at the constituencies. Mr Kiunjuri said elections will proceed as scheduled even if opposition leaders boycott them, adding that tallying will proceed with the votes which will have been cast and final results announced. “The only thing that can stop elections is a legal process. If the Supreme Court rules that we cannot do the election, then we shall abide by that ruling but not mere intimidation,” Mr Kiunjuri said. Speaking in Mombasa on Tuesday, the opposition leaders said that a court ruling allowing presidential results to be announced at the constituency level should not be overturned and if that happens they will boycott the August 8 elections. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has appealed against the ruling given last month. JUDICIARY Mr Kiunjuri, who spoke Wednesday at Muthaiga during the burial of prominent Nanyuki businessman Solomon Wachira, also called on the Judiciary to exercise sobriety when handling matters related to the forthcoming election. He said any judge who witnessed the 2007/2008 violence is aware how emotive elections can be and should avoid making judgments that are likely to ignite political violence. Similar sentiments were echoed by Laikipia East MP Mutahi Kimaru who accused the opposition of planning chaos and anarchy ahead of the forthcoming elections. “By threatening to boycott the elections, it is obvious their intention is to plunge the country into political violence,” Mr Mutahi said. The MP also announced that he will defending his seat as an independent candidate after losing in the just concluded Jubilee Party primaries.

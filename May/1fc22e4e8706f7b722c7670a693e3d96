"We've really been through a lot together positively," he said. Trump said that "safety seems to be very strong" in Egypt, which has seen deadly bombings and attacks on Christian Copts and security forces in past months.Responding through an interpreter, Sisi said: "Egypt is secure and stable and is going very well with the cooperation of the United States."You are a unique personality that is capable of doing the impossible," Sisi said, addressing Trump."I agree!," the billionaire president responded as everyone laughed. email print email print

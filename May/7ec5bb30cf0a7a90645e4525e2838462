Teachers have given the government seven days to release free education funds, warning that any delay would lead to disruption of learning. Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary-general Wilson Sossion, in a letter dated May 17 to Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, said the delay had “gravely inconvenienced” schools. “To date, no funds have been released to schools for the second term, despite many crucial programmes of co-curricular activities and expenditure by schools in other critical services to students,” said Mr Sossion. Schools reopened for second term on May 2 and will run until August 4. PROGRAMMES COLLAPSING “Many school programmes are collapsing due to lack of funds and schools risk early closure, with the compounded challenge of high prices of basic commodities required to deliver services to students,” said the Knut boss. Mr Sossion said the buck stopped at Dr Matiang’i “doorstep for failing to disburse the funds for secondary and primary schools”. “Be warned that your ministry shall be held responsible for problems that may affect schools, including collapse of programmes,” said Mr Sossion. Kenya Primary Schools Heads Association chairman Mr Shem Ndolo confirmed that schools had not received funds. “We have not received the capitation and school heads are crying,” said Mr Ndolo. RELEASE FUNDSKenya Secondary Schools Heads Association chairman Kahi Indimuli confirmed that schools had not received funds from the government. “We have talked to the ministry officials and they have assured us that they have done their part and are waiting for National Treasury to release the funds,” said Mr Indimuli. Schools receive 50 per cent of the capitation in first term, 30 per cent in second term and 20 per cent in third term. On Wednesday, Dr Matiang’i and his PS, Dr Belio Kipsang, did not respond to queries from Nation on when the funds would be released.   Chairman of school heads' association say they are barely surviving.

Bungoma based businessman Philip Wamoto will be the Amani National Congress flag bearer for the Webuye West parliamentary seat in the August 8 General Election. Mr Wamoto is seeking to unseat MP Dan Wanyama, who defected to Jubilee Party from ODM. The businessman was awarded the certificate by the party’s dispute resolution board after he successfully lodged a complaint claiming the primaries were marred by massive irregularities. Mr Jonathan Barasa Kane was announced the winner after the primaries. “I am very grateful to my party for awarding me the certificate,’’ said Mr Wamoto, a former chief campaigner of the MP. The businessman will face off with three other candidates for the parliamentary seat in the August elections. His rivals are his former boss Mr Wanyama, who will contest on Jubilee Party ticket, ODM's John Musundi, Peter Sitati of Ford Kenya and Kennedy Mkombozi of Maendeleo Chap Chap. "I am now ready to face my former boss. I heeded demands by voters to vie for this seat and am optimistic of trouncing the incumbent," said the ANC candidate.

Chris Rock has admitted that his infidelity led to his divorce. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine while on his Total Blackout Tour, Rock talked about how marriage is a hard commitment and thought out loud about probably not doing it again. In August of last year, Rock and Malaak Compton's divorce was finalised after two years of child-custody battles between the two. Compton insisted that Rock pay child support for Ntombi, a girl they raised together from when she was six months old. Ntombi was brought home from South Africa by Malaak. But the terms of the divorce are sealed and not much is known about the outcome of this tussle. They have joint custody of their two daughters, Lola Simone and Zahra Savannah. Rock has been seeing girlfriend Megalyn Echikunwoke for close to a year now. In the interview with Stephen Rodrick, Rock admitted: "I wasn't a good husband a lot of the times." In one of his shows, he said he only slept with three women. He even continued to say that he thought he could get away with his cheating because he was “the famous breadwinner” but has come to realise that the opposite of this train of thought was true. He said, “My faults are magnified. Your significant other, if they really love you, has a high opinion of you. And you let them down." Rock is on the road for his “Total Blackout Tour” that will also see him visit Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, besides different cities in the US. The tour has been extended into 2018, and will be used in the shooting of two specials for Netflix worth an estimated $40 million (Sh 4.124 billion).

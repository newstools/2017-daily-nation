As a way of nurturing youth talent, Taita Taveta Woman Representative Joyce Lay has promised to lobby for an increase in allocation of funds to arts, sports and culture. Ms Lay said that allocation of adequate funds will drive the progress of the youth. "We need more funds in the sector to enable our youth further their talents in sports and entertainments, this would only be possible through increasing funding to the sector," she said. INVEST IN SPORTS Ms Lay, who is vying for the countyâ€™s senatorial seat, said the youth can only eke out a living out of sporting and entertainment activities if they are supported. She said that the Sh9 million set aside for the establishment of a rescue centre in the region should instead be used to promote the sporting industry. "The money is not enough for the project, I will instead use my influence to have the money injected in sports because that is where we need it most to facilitate our youth," she said. NATURAL RESOURCES The Woman Rep was speaking at Danson Mwanyumba Stadium in Taita Taveta during the launch of the National Government Affirmative Action Fund aimed at supporting and nurturing talent. She also urged the youth to elect progress-oriented leaders. She also promised to constitute a committee that will ensure that 30 per cent of the revenue collected from the exploitation of the natural resources, for example titanium, is used to benefit the residents.

Two security guards were on Wednesday morning found killed outside an apartment in Jogoo, Kisii Town. The bodies of the security guards, one identified as Mokaya Mochama, 75, and the other one who is yet to be identified were found lying in a pool of blood. The guards look after the apartments and trucks that are parked outside the building. People who live in the apartment said that they did not hear any commotion at night and were shocked to find their lifeless bodies in the morning. “We did not hear any screams or commotion. Everything was calm as usual only for us to wake up and find the two men lying in a pool of blood,” said Ms Jane Kwamboka. Mr Kepha Ogoti, who is a truck driver, said that they received a call from residents that the guards had been killed. “It is like the people behind the murder are the same people who made away with mechanical parts of the trucks. We ask the police to investigate the matter and arrest the people behind this,” he said. At the crime scene, police had hard time trying to disperse people and relatives who were milling around the bodies. Kisii County Police Commander Agnes Mudambi said that investigations had started. “We received a call in the morning from the public that two men had been murdered in Jogoo area. We have started investigations," she said.

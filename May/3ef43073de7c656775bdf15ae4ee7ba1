A man was shot dead during a peaceful political procession along the Marsabit–Garba Tulla junction in Isiolo on Saturday hours after President Uhuru Kenyatta’s rally in the town. Supporters of a Jubilee Party team who were on a roadshow allege that a General Service Unit officer who had gone to clear the road shot at the man, identified as Ibrahim Mohammed. Speaking to the press shortly after recording a statement at Isiolo Police Station, Abdul Bahari, a Jubilee Party gubernatorial aspirant for the county, said the 21-year-old man was running for his life when a GSU officer aimed and shot at him. Mr Bahari said he was with his team including Isiolo North Member of Parliament Joseph Samal, Senator aspirant Mohammed Liban and Woman Representative aspirant Rehema Jaldesa when the incident occured. “We did not have a chance to address the public during the presidential rally, so we decided to address them during our peaceful procession,” Mr Bahari said. BARRICADED ROAD Isiolo Medical Superintendent Stephen Kiluva confirmed that the man was brought in dead. Detectives who visited Isiolo Referral Hospital said the man was shot in the head in the 4:30pm incident. Angry supporters barricaded the Isiolo-Marsabit road with stones after the incident, threatening to take matters into their own hands if the government fails to arrest the officer within 24 hours. Isiolo County Commissioner George Natembeya said investigations have been started. He said local residents own illegal firearms and these might have been used. Ms Jaldesa said the team had raised a complaint to security officers on a plot by their rivals to disrupt their rally. “We were happy as Jubilee supporters after receiving the President but we will not allow a government that we support to victimize our people for nothing,” she said. Mourners camped at the hospital.

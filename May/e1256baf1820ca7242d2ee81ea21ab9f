Sarit Centre has launched an ambitious Sh4 billion mega expansion project in a bid it terms is set to redefine Kenyans’ shopping experience. The project set to be handled by Broadway Malyan, is part of Sarit’s five-year strategic plan aimed at enhancing its presence in the country and the region by developing a ‘City within a City’. Addressing the media on Saturday, Sarit Centre director Sarit Shah said that under their strategic plan they plan to diversify and offer unique opportunities to retailers and support Kenyan businesses to push the ‘Made in Kenya’ brands. “The current wave of development is creating modern malls that are setting new standards for size and quality within the market. The Sarit Centre has its fingers on the pulse. We have a series of plans in the pipeline that will redefine the Kenyan shopping experience,” said Mr Shah. He said that the mall will comprise an additional retail space, a parking silo, an expanded exhibition and conferencing facility, entertainment spaces, and a roof garden with restaurants. Mr Shah added this was an improvement on the current mall that entails over 70 retail service outlets and 50 other tenants, standing on a 500, 000 square feet land. “Our success is basically pegged on quality and the experiences created by our spaces which in turn can be related to our business success. In the 1980’s, Sarit Centre made it possible for Kenyans to enjoy the mall experience and we will do it again,” he said. According to Knight Frank, a real estate consultant, Nairobi has the largest mall development hotspot with around 470, 000 square metres of shopping centre space in the pipeline and the current wave of development is creating modern malls that are setting new standards for the market in terms of size and quality.

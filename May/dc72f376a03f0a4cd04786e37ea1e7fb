Jubilee on Saturday formally endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta as the party flag bearer and William Ruto as his running mate in the August elections. During the party’s National Delegates Conference at Bomas of Kenya, President Kenyatta pledged to conduct his campaigns peacefully and discourage all acts of violence or action that incite the public. His Deputy also took the same pledge. Speaking after the endorsement, President Kenyatta said the government has set aside Sh5 billion to improve infrastructure in schools to ensure all pupils proceed to secondary schools after Class Eight. "It is the government responsibility to educate her children and we shall educate our children," he said. He said the government's ultimate goal is to have scrap all fees in day schools. President Kenyatta said the government will deal with rising cost of essential products such as flour when Parliament resumes. Mr Ruto said the party has been able to unite all Kenyans under one party. “The Opposition is saying it will try to unite Kenyans yet they have been unable to unite three parties,” he said. He said many elected leaders have abandoned the opposition to work with Jubilee to unite the country. He said the party primaries were free and fair and all Kenyans, irrespective of their background were nominated.   Moi says Kanu will support President Kenyatta's re-election.

Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi has said aspirants who lost in the Jubilee Party nominations and opted to vie as independents should be free to attend Jubilee campaigns rallies.He said since the candidates are supporting the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta, they should not be barred from Jubilee rallies. Our Jubilee Party nominations did not eliminate anybody, and since they are going to be on the ballot, we want the people to decide who they want to represent them. "Whether you are in JP or independent, we will consider you as Jubilee as long as you support President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy," said Mr Murungi, the Jubilee Party nominee for the Meru governorship. Senator Murungi pledged that if he wins he will work with all elected leaders in the county irrespective of their political parties, as long as they support President Kenyatta.Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, who is contesting the Meru senatorial seat on a Jubilee ticket, urged voters to ignore opposition aspirants, saying Jubilee should win more than 90 per cent of elective seats in the county.The two asked Kenyans to maintain peace before, during and after the August elections to avoid bloodshed or deaths. We are all Kenyans different political ideologies should not lead us to tribal clashes, we need each other after this year s polls, Mr Linturi said. email print email print

A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the political future of Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua who was defeated in the Jubilee Party primaries by Mr Lee Kinyanjui. On Wednesday evening, Governor Mbugua called and cancelled a press conference, fuelling speculations that he may have joined politicians who will defend their seats as independent candidates. The governor is yet to officially announce whether he will be on the ballot come August 8 after he lost in the Jubilee primaries. Mr Mbugua got 150,137 votes while Mr Kinyanjui polled 216,385 votes in the primaries to beat the governor. Since the defeat, Governor Mbugua has kept a low profile, telling journalists that he had taken some time to consult before he announces his next move. PRESS CONFERENCE On Wednesday evening, governor Mbugua’s communication team had called for a press conference, indicating that the governor was considering bouncing back after the latest defeat and was to make a major political announcement. However, the team sent another communication indicating the press conference which was to take place at the Top Cliff hotel in the outskirts of Nakuru Town had been called off. It now remains to be seen which political move the governor will make. If he decides to run as an independent, Governor Mbugua will have at least five opponents to contend with in the August 8 elections. They include Jubilee’s Mr Kinyanjui, Nakuru Senator James Mungai who has announced he will run as an independent and did not participate in the Jubilee nominations and nominated Senator Paul Njoroge (Kanu). Chama Cha Mashinani will also field Dr Peter Koros for the seat.

Lawmakers have dealt a major blow to former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru in her quest to put the National Youth Service scandal behind her. The MPs on Wednesday adopted a report by the Public Accounts Committee recommending that Ms Waiguru undergo investigations, a lifestyle audit and eventually be barred from public office over the NYS scandal. At least Sh1.2 billion was lost in the scandal that involved payments for phantom supplies and outright theft of cash from NYS bank accounts. The PAC recommended that Ms Waiguru "be barred from holding public office, if found guilty after due process, in light of her overall leadership failures at the ministry.” This was also for "Contravention of Chapter Six of the Constitution in its entirety but more specifically, Article 73 which provides that a State Officer must …bring honour to the nation and dignity to the office and promotes public confidence in the integrity of the office."

The High Court has ordered Party of National Unity (PNU) to repeat its primaries to pick its Embu County candidates for August 8 elections.Justice Richard Mwongo said that the party should repeat the exercise as directed by the political parties disputes tribunal (PPDT) last Saturday.He rejected PNU s argument that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine claims arising from political parties.Senior Counsel Okong o Omogeni had asked the court to quash the tribunal s judgement presided over by lawyers Kyalo Mbobu, James Atemi and Abdi Hassan.But lawyer Guantai Mwenda opposed the appeal saying the PPDT had legal mandate to adjudicate over disputes arising from political parties.NO CHANCEMr Mwenda said Transport PS Cyrus Njiru was not given a chance to contest the primaries in a fair competition.Dr Njiru is eyeing the Embu gubernatorial seat on the party s ticket. In his ruling, Justice Mwongo upheld the judgement of the PPDT that no proper primaries for PNU Embu County were conducted. He, therefore, directed that a repeat for the entire county for all candidates be conducted within 48 hours.Four PNU members Dennis Mugendi, Jeremiah Mugambi Njagi, Patrick Mucira Wilson and Simon Njue Gitegua filed the claim before the PPDT saying results were announced three days before the nominations were held. CONTEST RULINGMr Mwenda told the judge that over 30,000 PNU members did not vote as polling stations were merged and they were not informed of the changes.And immediately after the ruling, PNU said it will contest the ruling at the Court of Appeal. But Mr Mwenda opposed saying: There must be an end to litigation as there will be no PNU representatives in the August 8 polls. The judge allowed PNU upto May 8 to challenge his order in the High Court after which his orders be executed and the primaries conducted. email print email print

The Kenya national rugby team has the chance to prove its mettle against Germany in a test match at the RFUEA Ground in Nairobi on Saturday. The Simbas can only produce the desired results if they organise themselves properly. They have the competence to outrun the visitors. Also, it behooves the fans to troop to the ground to cheer the team to victory. We believe the Simbas’ 10-day training camp in Cape Town, South Africa was a useful outing and gave the team the mental preparedness to face big teams like Germany. Notably, Saturday’s match is part of both teams’ preparations for the 2019 Rugby World Cup qualifiers, so every side has a point to prove. Good preparations that include financial and material support have always proved vital for Kenya Simbas. It is recalled that the team missed qualifying for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England by a whisker. Namibia, whom they had beaten, sailed through on a better aggregate. This should not happen this time round. The players need to be well remunerated to produce the best results. Time is ripe for Kenya Simbas to be part of the big world rugby carnival, just like their Kenya Sevens counterparts. Besides government support, sponsors can come in handy here.

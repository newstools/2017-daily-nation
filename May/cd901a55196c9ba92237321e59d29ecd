A lobby has faulted the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties for rejecting the use of miraa images as symbols by independent candidates. Nyambene Miraa Traders Association (Nyamita) spokesman Kimathi Munjuri said the registrar still regards miraa as a drug, despite it having been recognised in law.Independent candidates are required to present symbols to the registrar and the IEBC for clearance. Speaking to the Nation, Mr Munjuri said several aspirants from Meru, Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Lodwar, Garissa and Wajir had presented symbols of miraa which were rejected. In a complaint letter sent to registrar s office and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Nyamita said independent candidates are being prevented from using of photos of the miraa plant, twigs or bundled twigs. The only reason a symbol presented by an independent candidate should be rejected is if it is in use by a political party or another candidate. We are unable to understand why a miraa symbol is being rejected and request for your advice on this matter We underline that miraa is a crop as per our laws, Mr Munjuri stated.He said the registrar is yet to respond to the inquiries."Aspirants should be allowed to use miraa as a symbol when they feel it will fully represent the interests of the electorate, he said.An aspirant seeking a ward representative's seat in Meru County and who did not wish to be named, said he had presented a bundle of miraa as a symbol but it was rejected. An official at the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties told me that miraa is a drug. I was forced to use my initials. I will be clearing with them tomorrow (Thursday), the aspirant said. email print email print Munjuri says the registrar still regards miraa as a drug, despite it having been recognised in law.

Drilling of oil and gas on Pate Island in Lamu East will start in June. Zarara Oil and Gas Limited Company officials visited Faza Island on Thursday and sensitised residents on the progress of the planned exploration and expectations. Addressing the public at Faza Social Hall, Zarara manager Peter Nduru said surveys conducted between 2013 and 2014 in about 400 kilometre stretch of blocks L4 and L13 confirmed that the area had oil and gas deposits. The June exploration marks the first phase of exploration and will cost Sh3 billion. The second phase of extraction is set to begin before December. The United Arab Emirates company will recruit locals who will work with experts in the exploration. “We will be recruiting youth from Lamu East who will be trained in order to provide assistance during the drilling work and provision of security,” said Mr Nduru. Zarara intends to drill around 102 wells in the area. The quantity of gas deposits will only be ascertained after intense drilling, said Mr Nduru. Zarara chief operations officer Austen Titford said families that will be affected during the drilling will be promptly compensated. “We are about to assemble our gadgets from all over the world to Mombasa, then to Lamu East. We will have camps and discussions are already ongoing for those whose land will be used for the same. “We want to ensure they are compensated. We are yet to agree on the amount of compensation,” said Mr Titford. Lamu Governor Issa Timamy assured the investor of cooperation from the county. He, however, asked the company to share its profits equitably with the community.

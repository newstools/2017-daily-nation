The 2018 Africa Nations Championship (Chan) Local Organising Sub-committee has promised to deploy more experts to help in construction of Meru’s Kinoru Stadium to international standards. Members of the sub-committee, led by chairman Engineer John Rugu, inspected the stadium in Meru County on Wednesday and promised to ensure it is completed in time for the Africa championships in January next year. Speaking at Kinoru during the inspection, Landscape Architect at Gorgia Development Company Daniel Collta said the company will deploy more exports to work on drainage systems, floodlights and the pitch to ensure it meets the required standards. “The size of the stadium is good and meets the international standards though the choice of grass is poor and needs to be redone. We will have more experts to ensure the stadium meets the required standard and on time,” Collta said. Collta added that the drainage and floodlights were not properly fixed and needed to be corrected saying rains and darkness should not affect the tournaments. He asked both the county and national governments to have a mechanism that will help maintain the stadiums, saying it is a long-term investment which needs to be preserved after the tournament. “We need to have a plan that will ensure the stadiums are maintained after the tournament because we have invested heavily in the project,” he said. A delegation from Caf is expected in the country next month to assess the venues.

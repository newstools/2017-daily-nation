Kaguru Agricultural Training Centre in Meru County will host the fourth Seeds of Gold Farming Clinic on May 20. The theme of the clinic is: “Creating new opportunities in dairy and horticulture farming”. It will feature innovations needed to drive a thriving dairy farming and horticulture agri-business in the country. At hand to give insight, education and impart knowledge on dairy and horticulture farming at the event are agricultural experts from Elgon Kenya Ltd, Yara, Egerton University, Simba Corp and the county government of Meru, among others. Mr Nelson Maina of Elgon Kenya said the company would also showcase its range of products for fighting the fall armyworm menace. “We now have a range of products to fight the pest. Farmers will be taught how to use these products,” he said. He added that the firm is also coming up with a dairy section and an expert will be available to advice farmers. Mr Paul Kinoti Kiriinya, the principle of Kaguru ATC, welcomed farmers and agri-business enthusiasts to the event. “Sponsors and stakeholders will be showcasing their technologies and innovations on horticulture and dairy farming. We at Kaguru ATC have our own new innovations on the same that will be of great interest to farmers, too.” He told farmers to embrace agri-business, noting that one stands to gain immensely. “Milk prices are currently skyrocketing, which gives a good basis to practice dairy farming. During this clinic, we will educate farmers on the best practices in dairy farming such as fodder cultivation, livestock feed formulation and how to take care of livestock. The clinics were initiated by Elgon Kenya and Seeds of Gold.   The farmers shared their experiences with fellow farmers and professionals in the event.

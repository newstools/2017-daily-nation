The daughter of a British tycoon who died in Mombasa four years ago on Friday said she was not aware her grandmother wanted to have her father’s remains flown to the United Kingdom, an inquest heard. Ms Alexandra Veevers also told the inquest that her mother did not refuse her grandmother’s request to have the remains flown to the UK. “I am not aware my grandmother Ruth Veevers offered to pay airfreight cost to transport the body from Mombasa,” said Ms Veevers upon cross examination by lawyer Kinyua Kamundi. She was testifying in an inquest into the death of her father, Mr Harry Veevers, who died on February 14, 2013 in Mombasa. According to a letter read out during the inquest addressed to Kenyan authorities, Ruth said she wanted her son’s body in the UK. Ms Veevers denied that together with her mother tried to take her brother’s Philip camera by force while at a hotel. “My mother and I saw Philip at the hotel’s reception, we asked him to see the pictures, he refused,” said Ms Veevers adding that it is not true they attacked him. Ms Veevers also denied that she screamed that her brother Philip had stolen her camera and that together with her mother chased him around the hotel. The witness who said she was heartbroken and upset by her father’s death said that she was not aware if her parents were living in separate bedrooms. According to the witness, her mother did not tell her when her father converted to Islam. She denied that her mother and aunt arranged to have her father buried in a Muslim cemetery assuming his body would not be exhumed. Ms Veevers said she went to her father’s house after burial and was not aware if he had any documents in the house. The witness had previously told the court that she wants her father’s remains to be reburied. The inquest was adjourned to September 18.

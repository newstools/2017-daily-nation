The 2017 World Press Freedom Day is being celebrated today, May 3. Addressing a gathering during celebrations at the Intercontinental Hotel in Nairobi, the chairman of the Editors’ Guild Linus Kaikai said fake news has now become a reality and its effects have been felt more following the US elections won by President Donald Trump. He said as Kenya approaches the August general elections, media houses are ready to give world-class coverage of the polls. He also put security forces and politicians on the spot for harassing journalists. The UN General Assembly declared May 3 World Press Freedom Day with the aim of raising awareness on the importance of press freedom and remind governments of their duty to respect the right to freedom of expression. UNESCO AWARD Unesco marks the World Press Freedom Day by conferring the Unesco/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize on a deserving individual or organisation. The prize is named in honour of Guillermo Cano Isaza, a Colombian journalist assassinated in 1986. His writings had offended Colombia's powerful drug barons. The theme of the 2017 World Press Freedom Day is "Media's Role in Advancing Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies". JOURNALISTS HARASSED Speaking at the Intercontinental Hotel, ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru paid tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty. “We note with regret the instances where journalists have been harassed, beaten or lost their lives in the line of duty. This should not happen,” said Mr Mucheru. Kenya Union of Journalists (KUJ) Secretary-General Eric Oduor called on the government and the media to work together to ensure that they formulate policies to protect Kenyan media. "We see a lot of investment in Kenyan media but which hasn't been supported by policy," he said.

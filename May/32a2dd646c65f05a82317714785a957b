Former Kamukunji MP Simon Mbugua on Thursday surrendered his Jubilee Party ticket to incumbent Yusuf Hassan, saying that the decision came after consultation with the party leadership. Mr Mbugua, who had been announced winner, became the first victor of the primaries to relinquish his win. Others like Starehe MP Maina Kamanda had their wins nullified by the party’s disputes tribunal. On Wednesday, in a Press conference personally managed by President Uhuru Kenyatta's personal Secretary Jomo Gecaga, Mr Mbugua said he had made the decision “for the bigger picture.” "After detailed consultations, I am persuaded that the interests of our country and our city are more important than the win of an individual," Mr Mbugua said. The presence of Mr Gecaga at the press conference where he quickly whisked away Mr Mbugua after reading a prepared statement displayed the undertones of President Kenyatta's influence in the decision. Mr Mbugua said that he had also waived his right to challenge the results even at the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal. “I know my supporters will be very disappointed with this decision. I want to tell them to look at the bigger picture,” Mr Mbugua said. He was flanked by Senator Mike Sonko, the Jubilee Party's nominee for Nairobi governor, and Mathare MP Steve Kariuki.

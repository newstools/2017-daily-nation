Former Chama Cha Uzalendo party leader Wavinya Ndeti has won the Wiper party ticket for the Machakos County governor’s seat. Ms Ndeti beat Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala in virtually all polling stations to emerge the winner with 299,312 votes against Mr Kiala's 4,663. Announcing the results at Machakos Primary School, the county tallying centre, returning officer Jacob Mutula said the results were final and any aggrieved contender could appeal through the right channels. Mr Mutula said no anomalies were recorded in the nominations, adding that voting was peaceful. However, Mr Kiala and his agents stayed away from the polls. The deputy governor had obtained orders to stop the Machakos nominations. NOT AWARE OF ORDERS But Wiper party leaders said they had not been served with the orders and therefore went on with the polls. Speaking after being declared the winner, Ms Ndeti said she was happy with the win and welcomed Mr Kiala to work with her. "I am happy with the people of Machakos and I thank God for the victory. I am sure I will be the governor of Machakos in August and I promise I will not disappoint (the people),” said Ms Ndeti. Her running mate, Peter Mathuki, said the team is ready for the August elections and assured residents that the county will be spared the frequent political infighting witnessed between Governor Alfred Mutua and his deputy, Mr Kiala. Voters, who celebrated the results, said Ms Ndeti's win should make Governor Mutua "very afraid". Dr Mutua garnered about 255,000 votes in the 2013 general elections.

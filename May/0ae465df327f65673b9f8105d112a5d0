Property worth millions of shillings was on Sunday night destroyed after a fire razed a dormitory at Koimbi Boys High School in Kiharu constituency, Murang'a County. The fire was reported to have started at around 7.20pm when students were in class for evening studies. School Principal John Muthee said the teacher on duty who noticed smoke billowing from the dormitory alerted the security for action. “After they confirmed that the dormitory was on fire they called the students out to help put out the fire,” he said. Mr Muthee attributed the fire to an electric fault noting that all students had been accounted for. “We feel that this was an accident as all students were in class,” he said. The razed dormitory accommodates around 200 students while the school population is about 460 students. “I want to assure all parents that their children are safe and are well taken care of. We will however conduct thorough investigations on the cause of the fire,” he said. According to the Principal, the combined efforts of the students, staff and villagers helped put out the fire, which nearly spread to adjacent dormitories. Several students lost their belonging including uniform and books as they could not get into the the building on time. Fire fighters from the county arrived at 8pm when the fire had already been put out. Board of Management Chair Francis Gachora appealed to the government to help reconstruct the dormitory. “We are appealing to well-wishers to support the school in reconstruction of the destroyed dormitory. The school has lost a lot so have the students,” he said.

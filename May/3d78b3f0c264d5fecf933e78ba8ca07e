Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga has cautioned the coalition’s supporters against infighting and squabbles, saying Jubilee is the only common enemy. Speaking at a meeting of Nasa officials at Kisii Sports Club, Mr Odinga asked Nasa members to shun wrangles, saying this will distract them from their objective of dislodging Jubilee from power in August. "We might have our differences but they should not distract us from the mission of defeating our common enemy which is Jubilee," said Mr Odinga. He insisted that the alliance's 10 million-strong voter base is a reality. The opposition chief called on supporters to turn out in large numbers and ensure a landslide win for Nasa. He said Nasa has enough voting numbers to defeat Jubilee in the August 8 elections. SUFFICIENT NUMBERS "We have sufficient numbers to [defeat] Jubilee. What we must exercise is discipline, commitment and watchfulness to ensure the victory is ours," he said. Mr Odinga said the registered voters in Nyanza and western Kenya are more than four million. "We have at least 2.7 million voters in Nyanza alone and another 1.9 million in the western region. If we can mobilise at least 2.5 million in Nyanza and 1.5 million in western, we already have a head start of 4 million votes," said the Nasa flag bearer. NEXT GOVERNMENT He reiterated the coalition's determination to form the next government and urged supporters to turn up and vote on August 8. "We mean business and are confident of getting the 10 million votes at the polls. “However, all our supporters must turn out in large numbers and vote in order to ensure that we register an early win," said Mr Odinga. He said the alliance targets a 95 per cent voter turnout in the coming election. "We need each and every voter to report to the polling station early and cast his or her ballot," the ODM leader said.

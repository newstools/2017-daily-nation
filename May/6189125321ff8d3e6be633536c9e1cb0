Kim Kardashian West has been slammed for an insensitive Ariana Grande Instagram post. The curvaceous 36-year-old a mother of two was accused of trying to steal the show of the Manchester attack when she posted a photo of her partying with Kendall Jenner and Ariana Grande. The attack happened after Ariane Grande s show in Manchester Arena on Monday. She captioned the since deleted photo: I m praying for everyone in Manchester. This is truly so senseless &amp; heart breaking. I can t imagine the fear and agony these parents must be going through searching for their kids. Concerts are supposed to be a place where u can let loose and have fun. It s so scary to not feel safe in this world. My heart goes out to @arianagrande I love you. The post irritated many of her fans with many saying she was trying to still the sorrowful moment for her own good. Instead posting a picture of yourself maybe show some compassion and sincerity for all those poor people who have lost their kids?? So selfish such a terrible post and picture, lamented one. And another vented; Kim sometimes you can be so vain. Why post a picture of you in it? Just say your condolences. The world is not about you. The tweets kept coming Why do you put this picture of you patying [sic] with Ariana Grande @kimkardashian so pathetic and sad! Then there was: To be honest this tragedy is not about either one of them, people lost their lives at some point it s just tacky to impose yourself into situations#Bad Decision sorry this has nothing to do with you Kim, stay out of it. Other than the 22 people who died in the terror attack, 59 were left seriously injured by the barbaric act of a 23 year old Briton suicide bomber with Libya roots who blew himself up. email print email print

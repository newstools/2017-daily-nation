Former Nithi MP Petkay Miriti will be contesting for the Tharaka-Nithi governorship as independent candidate. Mr Miriti lost in the Jubilee Party primaries to Chuka/Igambang’ombe MP Muthomi Njuki, even after petitioning the party’s tribunal on rigging claims. Speaking to the Nation on Monday, the former legislator said the Jubilee nominations were flawed and dismissed his defeat by Mr Njuki. “The nomination results were fake because my opponent’s supporters were allowed to mark many ballot papers and the results were altered after counting in favour of my rival,” said Mr Miriti. He said he is sure of clinching the seat if the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) conducts free, fair and credible elections in August. RUNNING MATE Mr Miriti said he had already identified another running mate after his last two choices declared that they will support his rival. “I don’t want to announce my new catch because the last two were given money to ditch me,” he said. He however said he has identified one from Tharaka Constituency. Mr Njuki and the incumbent Governor Samuel Ragwa have also picked their deputies from Tharaka Constituency. Mr Miriti dismissed claims that he is being funded by Mr Ragwa to disadvantage Mr Njuki by dividing the Chuka/Igambang’ombe Constituency votes. The other candidate seeking the seat is Mr Kathee Wa Kathee who is vying on an ODM ticket.   MP Muthomi Njuki denies claims, says he was meeting his supporters. #ElectionsKE

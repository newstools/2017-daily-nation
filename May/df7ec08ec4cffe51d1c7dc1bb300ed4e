Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua s Maendeleo Chap Chap Party has gone to court seeking to suspend a section of the law that bars politicians from defecting after losing in the recently held nominations.Together with Mogotio MP Hellen Sambili and Mr Carnicius Jackson Mesoh, who was contesting for the Dagoretti North parliamentary seat on a Jubilee ticket, have sued the electoral agency.Through lawyer Wilfred Nyamu, the two claimed that they were both members of the Jubilee Party but resigned to join Maendeleo Chap Chap after being dissatisfied with the party primaries held on April 24.The amended Elections Act allows defectors to do so 120 days to the General Election. High Court judge John Mativo also upheld that law in his April 27 ruling.But according to the two, that law consequently bars them from joining another party since the 120 days deadline elapsed as of April 10.LOCKED OUT Their aspirations to contest the seats of the National Assembly can only be realised through resignation from Maendeleo Chap Chap party or run as independent candidates but that law amounts to an unreasonable limitation to the enjoyment of their rights hence prejudices them, said Mr Nyamu.He also told the court that if the two opt to run as independent candidates, the deadline for submission of symbols may still see them locked out hence they are highly prejudiced.The Council of Governors had earlier sued the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) challenging changes to the law that narrowed the window.The same judge had initially temporarily suspended that law but in his final verdict, he upheld it saying that it does not show any level of infringement.Justice Mativo had also ruled that the pre-election process within a political party should be done in a transparent way that is free of taints of electoral fraud or coercion.He further termed that law as clear, precise and unambiguous while supporting amendments made saying that the changes were necessary for proper preparation of the elections.EXTEND DEADLINEAccording to the two aspirants, the nomination exercises in which they participated in were marred with rigging and irregularities hence saw them lose. It is in the interest of justice, fairness, reasonableness as well as constitutionalism, this matter be certified urgent and that a temporary order be issued suspending the deadlines set by that law which effectively prohibits aspirants from seeking elective posts, said Mr Nyamu.Should the court decline to suspend that law, the two aspirants want the deadline extended only for them so that they can vie as Maendeleo Chap Chap party members.Justice Enoch Chacha Mwita set the hearing of the case for Monday. email print email print ODM leader says they have adopted mechanisms to tackle rigging in the August 8 polls.

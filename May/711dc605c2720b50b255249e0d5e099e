At just 15, and coming from a background where women are to be seen and not heard, Fardosa Irshad Muhamud is remarkable. The Standard Eight pupil at Umulkheir Girls Day and Boarding School in Garissa County, where she is one of the 250 pupils, speaks with confidence and has a clear picture of what she wants  to do in the future. So, how come she is in school in an area where girls’ education is not considered a priority? “I came here when I was seven years old. I started at the nursery school and now, at 15, I am in Standard Eight. How did I end up here?  That’s a long story. But let me give you a summary: I have some aunts, women who were lucky enough to have gone to school. They brought me here by force,”  says the soft-spoken, bright-faced girl. Forcibly because her father (now dead), didn’t want her to go to school. Instead, when she was seven, he wanted her to be circumcised, as is the practice in the area. But her aunts, aware that after circumcision she would be deemed ready for marriage in another seven or eight or nine years, decided that she deserved better. So they took her from home and took her to the school, which also serves as a rescue centre for girls at similar risk. “I am now 15 years old. I know what I want. I know what I like. I know that after primary school would like to go to the Kenya High School, Alliance Girls’ High School, or Starehe Girls’ School. And I know that to do that, I must score more than the 375 marks that I scored in the first term.  That’s why my target for KCPE is about 430 marks,”  she explains This only girl in a family of three siblings has her future plans all laid out before her. But she does not seem to be aware that to be admitted to an original national school (original in that it was not one of the provincial schools that were upgraded) like Alliance Girls, competition is extremely stiff. Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2015, about 137,000 girls chose Alliance Girls High School as their first choice, but only 400 girls were admitted, representing a 0.29 acceptance rate. Still, she says that school has taught her to be confident. Besides, she now knows her rights. She knows about people she’s never seen and places  she has never been, and she finds it fascinating that there is so much in the world. She is so fascinated by the vastness of the world that she has decided  to become a journalist when she completes school. She wants to interact with the world, she says.   SIMPLE STUDENT So she is focusing on the sciences, social studies and English, which she believes are requisite for a career in journalism. She is well aware that, had she not been in school, her life would have been very difficult, so together with the other girls in the school, she counts herself lucky. Indeed, life for girls in this hot and dry part of the country is tough for girls. It involves looking after livestock and fetching water from the River Tana, which is infested with crocodiles. The reptiles often make a meal of the domestic animals that come to drink in the river, so the fear of being attacked by one is very real. Then there is the issue of early marriage. Many girls are married off at the age of 15 or 16 to much older men. Once they start having children at this age, their future is practically ruined since their chances for improving their lives are greatly reduced. This is exactly the kind of life Fardosa and other girls in the school have been spared. In many of the villages in Garissa County, most young girls live a life far removed from modern times. To an outsider, the shock of realising that between the ages of seven and around 10 young girls are supposed to be circumcised by elderly women in accordance with their culture is only upstaged by the fact that most of the girls go through this process not out of choice, but at the insistence of those closest to them, especially their fathers. Whereas fathers here look at mature women as child-bearing vessels and a source of labour, they look at young girls as a source of wealth, like items to be bartered for something else. And the first step in this trade is circumcision.  Once a girl is circumcised, her family takes care of her until she is about 15 or 16, then she’s married off. Fardosa is not fazed by the crowd of girls who have walked out class and are looking at her as she talks. She has learnt to take such attention in her stride. “Are you a prefect, captain or bell ringer,” I ask her.  She replies with a smile that she is not in any position of authority but “just a simple student”, before going on to paint a picture of what life would have been like for her, had she not been in school. “If I wasn’t here, I dread thinking about where I would be. I know what those other girls are going through. My worst fear would have been walking around  herding cattle and looking for pasture.” “When school closes for the holidays, she goes home to Masalani, where her mother, Habiba Ahmed, lives. This is the only other place, apart from school, where she feels safe. Her mother is her number one fan and supporter in this “going to school thing”. Fardosa acknowledges that her mother has sheltered her from the things girls her age in the area have to go through. Even in terms of the work that females are expected to perform, she knows only a few. “I can fetch water. I can also make spaghetti. The other things like herding livestock, building or taking care of a manyatta and cooking complicated meals… those I don’t know how to do,” she says with a nervous giggle, as if it is funny but also something to be ashamed of. She adds that she just realised that preparing spaghetti must be a two- or three- step process. Fardosa does not know the full extent of what being in school and having a supportive mother has protected her from. She is lucky that she has dreams beyond Masalani, and, indeed, beyond Garissa. Most of the girls in the county, who are not lucky to be in school or those in school but see no future away from the place, have little to look forward to. In addition to early marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM), there is child trafficking, in which some girls from the region are taken to Somalia through Dadaab.  Then there is the subjugation aof women. The school matron, Mrs Maryam Hussein, a trained teacher, says that 150 of the girls under her care are orphaned, while the rest have stories similar to Fardosa’s. “Parents don’t see the need to educate girls. As has happened in the past, today we have girls who escaped early (forced) marriages, girls who escaped FGM, orphaned girls and those from needy backgrounds. But it is not enough; girls in this county are highly at risk,” she explains as she rounds up some girls and gives them instructions. It is late in the evening and the girls need to start getting into their evening schedule. Wearing black shoes, white socks  a navy blue dress with a white head covering, Fardosa and her school mates look like girls in any part of the county.   FALSE COURAGE The hijab —a cultural and religious item of clothing — has been made part of their uniform and it is hard not to wonder whether, without fans in the classrooms in the sweltering heat, the girls do not feel suffocated by the uniform. Fardosa acknowledges that the heat is stifling but they have learnt to survive.  “I wear the hijab because it is part of the school rules. But even if it wasn’t, I would still wear it. It is part of my culture. Yes, it is hot in Garissa, but we can handle it,” she offers. Mr Esikuri, the head teacher, lets on that the girl might be uneasy about telling the  truth regarding  the hijab. He reveals that, because of the heat, when a female teacher goes to class for a lesson, the girls sometimes remove their head coverings, and then when a male teacher goes to class, they put them  back on. As DN2 is talking to Fardosa, another girl passes close by. Fardosa says the girl is her best friend and calls her to join us. The new girl is calm, and confident and has this positively mischievous glint in her eye. Her name is Arfi Abdi, and wants to become a woman representative. Arfi behaves like a politician and has what appears to be the false courage politicians have. “We are both in Standard Eight. I hear she wants to become a journalist, good. I will be the Woman Representative for this area. I think there is a lot that can be done for girls in this region. I also think that there are opportunities, especially outside Garissa, that our girls can explore. Do you have another question for me?” she asks. These girls want to take advantage of their privileged position and have realised  that they have a lot to do to make things better for the girls coming after them. ****** Culture that stifles women’s progress MR ABDIRAHMAN KUSOW, the programme coordinator at WomanKind Kenya, a Garissa-based NGO, says that girls in the county are  still oppressed, despite interventions by the State and private organisations. “Look, girls here are viewed in a rather functional, if not practical, way. FGM is tied to culture and by the age of nine, a girl should have been cut. This paves the way for marriage by 15. Their fathers are keen on the marriage part because to them, marrying off your daughter is one way of shoring up or creating wealth. The bride price for a young girl here is about 20 goats, 12 cows and five camels; at the livestock market, a mature camel costs as much as Sh120,000,” he says of  the age-old problem, adding that early marriage poses a real threat to the girls’ future. The head teacher, Mr Alex Esikuri, concurs, adding that the local people are slowing learning about the adverse effects of the practice on girls and their development. “Gender equality is not upheld  here. We have girls  come to nursery school at the age of 10. Boys begin school much earlier. If this were a mixed school, I am almost certain that boys’ enrolment and attendance would be higher than that of the girls,” says the man in charge of 12 teachers and 250 pupils, ___________ IN NUMBERS 9 Age at which girls are circumcised in Garissa County  ***** 15 Age at which they are married off in Garissa County  **** 250 The number of pupils at Umulkheir Girls Day and Boarding School  ***** 150 The number of orphaned pupils at the school

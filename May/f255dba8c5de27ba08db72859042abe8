Relations between the National Treasury and the Council of Governors have been rocky since the experiment with devolution began in 2013. These ties are set to hit a new low this week due to plans by the National Treasury to severely curtail the flow of funds to the counties after May 31. According to bureaucrats in the finance ministry, the measures they are taking are necessary to safeguard public funds: governors sensing defeat on August 8, they argue, may engage in a looting spree before exiting office. Governors sense sabotage. They argue that they have numerous pre-existing commitments. Failure to pay suppliers, they say, will expose them to legal challenges and needless possible loss of public funds if those challenges are successful. SIMPLY AGREE This is yet another case where the two sides—the national government and counties—are engaging in a dialogue of the deaf instead of simply sitting down and agreeing on a way forward that protects public funds while keeping counties functional. President Uhuru Kenyatta should show good faith and leadership by accepting Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok’s request for a meeting of the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council, which is charged with tackling disputes such as this one. This clash between the national government and counties is not only unnecessary but is one that can be resolved by a display of greater maturity on both sides. The devolved system will only achieve the desired goal of development at the grassroots when both levels of government work together as partners, not rivals.

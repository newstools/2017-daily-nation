Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi now says the parliamentary team on electoral reforms, which he co-chaired with Siaya Senator James Orengo, had agreed that presidential votes be announced at the national tallying centre.Mr Murungi has said the 14-member joint parliamentary committee s report made it clear that only votes for MPs and MCAs would be announced at the constituency tallying centre.Speaking during a Catholic Men Association (CMA) prayer rally at Laare Catholic Church on Monday, Mr Murungi said those pushing for the final declaration of presidential results at the constituencies are inciting the public.BOYCOTT POLLThis is after the opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa) maintained that the presidential election results announced at the constituency level should be deemed final otherwise they will boycott the elections. Those saying that presidential votes must be announced at the constituency level are looking for trouble. The presidential votes are to be declared in Nairobi by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman. Anything to the contrary is not what we agreed on in the electoral reforms team, Mr Murungi said.Senator Murungi called on the Church to earnestly pray for peace, saying the opposition s threats to boycott the August elections do not mean well for the country.Nasa has threatened to boycott the August 8 elections if IEBC does not withdraw an appeal against a ruling to have the presidential election results at the constituency deemed as final.The commission has warned against what it has said are threats to its independence.But Nasa has been insisting that this is a plot to introduce vote rigging. email print email print

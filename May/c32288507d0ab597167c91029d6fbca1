After sitting out of three consecutive league matches, Mathare United head coach Francis Kimanzi has been handed a reprieve after his seven match ban was reduced to four matches by the Independent Disciplinary and Appeals Committee (IDAC). Kimanzi, who had earlier been handed a one month ban by the Independent Disciplinary and Complains Committee (IDCC), moved with speed to appeal the decision which has now been overturned by the IDAC. In its ruling, IDAC upheld the Sh50,000 fine against Kimanzi but noted that the one month touchline ban does not effectively communicate the sanction applicable to the coach according to Fifa rules. Following the recent development, Kimanzi will now complete his four match suspension in the round 9 league match against Bandari after which he will resume normal touchline duties as from the 10th round tie against Kariobangi Sharks on Tuesday, May 9.   Mathare are placed 12th in the table of standings with nine points.

The Education ministryâ€™s new set of rules to guide the creation, teaching and examining of university courses is welcome, though long overdue. University education has expanded exponentially over the past 15 years, giving rise to a blistering competition for students and rush to establish degree and diploma programmes. Unfortunately, the Commission for University Education, the body mandated to supervise admissions, teaching, degree programmes, lecturer qualification, among other roles, has been unable to keep up with the pace. This has let the universities free to mount all manner of courses without the requisite technical support, raising queries on the quality of the degrees. DEMANDING UNIFORMITY The Federation of Kenya Employers has been demanding uniformity in course duration, admissions and examinations. This is why the announcement that stringent rules are being drafted to introduce a systemic balance and sequence to higher learning should come as a relief to the students, potential employers and the universities. The government should, however, consult widely to ensure that the students already enrolled in the institutions do not suffer from any punitive measures that may arise from enforcing the new rules. However, the authorities should not hesitate to stop the universities offering programmes whose capacity they clearly lack.

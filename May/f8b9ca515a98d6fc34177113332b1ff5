Kakamega Homeboyz on Saturday compounded AFC Leopards’ woes with a hard-fought 1-0 win in their SportPesa Premier League match at Mumias Sports Complex. Former Leopards striker Lamine Diallo struck in the 74th minute to pile on more misery on his former employers, who have now gone for six matches without a win after a promising start to the season. Both sides emerged from the dugout ready to rumble with the early exchanges creating some goalscoring opportunities. Paul Kiongera could have opened the scoring for Leopards just five minutes into the match but his header missed the target from a Bernard Mang’oli cross.Wycliffe Ochomo was denied by an advancing Leopards custodian Gabriel Andika in the 11th minute after some god work by Stephen Wakhanya. Leopard’s coach Stewart Hall was forced to make an early substitution, with Marcellius Ingotsi replacing injured Kiongera, who sustained a knee injury during an aerial tussle with Hedmond Mauda in the 19th minute. Moses Chikati was booked by referee Wilson Otieno for a foul on Gilbert Fiamenyo at the half-hour mark. Both teams went for the break at 0-0.Meshack Karani put through Ali Bai 10 minutes after the restart but couldn’t find the target. Homeboyz coach Mike Mururi brought in Andrew Kulecho for Ochomo while Hall introduced Samuel Ndungu for Marcus Abwao. Homeboyz now camped in Leopards danger zone and were with 16 minutes to go after Bai put through Diallo to stab home the winner. “I must say the boys have picked up well. It is my wish that we maintain the same spirit into our next matches,” Mururi said. Leopards Coach Hall said his charges were unlucky to leave Mumias empty handed. “The boys played well. We missed many scoring chances. But we must attack better,” the Briton said.   Ssimbwa blamed his forwards for failing to fire his side to victory.

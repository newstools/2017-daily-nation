A Nairobi-based private equity firm has acquired Jambo Biscuits, the maker of confectioneries under the Britania brand. Catalyst on Monday announced it had completed buying out Jambo Biscuits for an undisclosed amount, seeking to ride on a projected growth in uptake of confectioneries and pastries by Kenya’s middleclass. “Our investment was anchored on the innovation platform consistently achieved by the brand within the biscuits category, as well as positive market fundamentals in a sector that is growing faster than the GDP, propelled by younger demographics and growing disposable income,” said Catalyst chief executive Paul Kavuma. The PE fund did not, however, disclose the transaction price. Jambo Biscuits was founded in 1987 by Nitin Dawda, as a small bakery enterprise. The entity, which now employs about 300 workers, started off with biscuits but later diversified into snacks and confectionery.

Manji Foods, previously House of Manji, is Kenya’s market leader in the biscuits category with a market share of 27 per cent in 2016, according to data from research firm Euromonitor.

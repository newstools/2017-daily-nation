A man believed to be a member of a car theft syndicate in Nyeri town has been charged with stealing two vehicles worth more than Sh1 million. Kahihia Mwai appeared before Resident Magistrate Phillip Mutua looking frail following an attack by a mob on Tuesday outside Eland hotel. He was attacked while attempting to steal a car at a parking bay. PLEAD GUILTY With a bandage on his head, face injuries and wearing bloody clothes, Mr Mwai's second charge related to the attempted theft of another car at Outspan Hospital on March 3 this year. Though he pleaded guilty to trying to steal the first vehicle, he said that in the second incident he was only leaning on the vehicle with no intentions of stealing it. "I was leaning on the car, but the owner raised the alarm saying that I was attempting to break in. I was attacked by members of the public and they wanted to kill me," Mr Mwai said. IN PAINHe was rescued by police officers, who shot twice in the air to scare away the irate residents. But eyewitnesses said he had already broken into the vehicle and was about to speed off when the owner raised the alarm. He was taken to Nyeri County Level Five Hospital, where he was treated and discharged. In court, Mr Mwai complained that he was in intense pain and asked the court to order that he be treated. He was released on a Sh1 million bond with the same amount as surety. TARGETED VEHICLES The case will be mentioned on May 18. In the recent past, about 10 motorists have lost their cars at parking bays to thieves targeting Toyota models such as Fielders. They are said to be using master keys and special gadgets to disable the electronic locking and tracking systems of the vehicles.

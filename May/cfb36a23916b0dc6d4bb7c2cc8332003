Defending champions Tusker on Saturday cruised to a 1-0 win over Kakamega Homeboyz at a rain-soaked Ruaraka grounds to move fourth in the SportPesa Premier League standings. Humphrey Mieno struck the winner in the 33rd minute after latching onto a rebound after Homeboyz goalkeeper David Juma parried Marlone Tangauzi's shot into his path. The win saw the brewers move into fourth place in the table having established a six-match unbeaten record, a signal that they have finally overcome their disastrous start to the season. Tusker coach Geroge Nsimbe started with Collins Shivachi, James Situma, Marlone Tangauzi and Shaffiq Batambuze in defence while Mieno and Cersidy Lumumba were pulling the strings in midfield. The visitors could have taken the lead midway through the opening half but Meshack Karani shot straight at goalkeeper Duncan Ochieng in Tusker goal. Charles Momanyi and Estone Esiye were also culpable of wasting open chances from set pieces for the visitors who had a second half appeal for a penalty turned down. The rest of the second half was a see saw battle where the home team created little and Homeboyz squandering several chances due to lack of precision. "We are now fairing on well and these are the kinds of results that we want. The team has picked up well and the most impressive thing is that the young players are finally finding their rhythm," Nsimbe said after the match. At the Afraha Stadium in Nakuru, leaders Posta Rangers became the first team this season to pass the 20-point mark as they beat Sofapaka by a solitary goal. The game between Chemelil Sugar and Muhoroni Youth was called off due to the heavy rains in Chemelil that rendered the Chemelil Sports Complex unplayable.   Posta's best chance came at the quarter hour mark.

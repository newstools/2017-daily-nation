An Administration Police officer attached to the Diplomatic Police Unit in Gigiri was arrested after he was found robbing residents in Hamza, Buruburu, on Tuesday night. His colleagues from the Hamza AP camp were on patrol on Jogoo Road at 9pm when passers-by reported to them that they had encountered an armed person at a nearby trading centre. When the officers approached the man, he started shooting at them and they returned fire, injuring him. When he was finally arrested, the police officers realised that he was a colleague of their attached to the Diplomatic Police Unit in Gigiri. “The officer was disarmed, taken to hospital and put under arrest as investigations continue,” police said. The police officer fired 12 rounds of ammunition from his official Jericho pistol. The spent cartridges were collected for ballistic investigations. The incident comes a day after another police officer was arrested in Kyuso in Mwingi, Kitui County, when he was seen taking video of his colleagues during an operation.

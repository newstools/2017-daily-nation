The electoral commission will finalise clearing aspirants who want to run as independent candidates on Monday. On Friday, the Registrar of Political Parties had cleared 2,700 aspirants after the deadline was from May 4 to May 8. Owing to the large number of independent candidates, some of them were asked to resubmit their symbols as they were identical to existing ones. Lucy Ndung'u, the registrar of political parties, asked those whose symbols had been rejected to "quickly get creative and find others before deadline". The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has also said it has the capacity to handle such a large number of independent candidates. This is the largest number of independent candidates in the country's history. "We are not going to hire any more clerks or people to handle the elections as we have the infrastructure in place and are adequately prepared," said IEBC Communications Officer Andrew Limo. More than 4,000 aspirants will run as independents. After clearing the aspirants, the commission is expected to move to the next stage of endorsing the names of successful candidates submitted after the party primaries, with the exception of aspirants who are yet to be cleared by their parties because of disputes in the nominations.   Parties and independent candidates have only Monday to submit names and symbols.

Athletics Kenya has named a strong marathon team for the World Championships on August 4-13 in London. Though there have been key withdrawals, including Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge and women’s marathon world record holder Mary Keitany, the team still looks strong. Those named are two-time World Marathon champion Edna Kiplagat, World Marathon silver medallist Helah Kiprop and London Marathon champion Daniel Wanjiru. However, the withdrawals have created an opportunity for other athletes, who are equally good, having won major races. HARD WORK Kenyan men have not won the World Marathon since Abel Kirui did in 2011, while the women relinquished the title Edna Kiplagat won in 2011 and 2013 at the 2015 championships. With proper training, focus and hard work, the Kenyans can reclaim the titles. As AK managers meet this week to draft the training programme, the marathoners ought to be given a free hand on how they wish to train as they know the intricacies involved. Kenya will be the team to watch, especially after topping the medal standings for the first time during the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, with seven gold, six silver and three bronze medals. However, AK should be on the lookout for cheats who could ruin the country’s chances and soil our name through doping.

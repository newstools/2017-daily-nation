Delegates of the Democratic Party of Kenya (DP) will meet later in May to officially endorse President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election bid. Organising Secretary Njagi Kumantha said the party has invited the Head of State for a meeting before the end of the month, where he will meet DP candidates for formal endorsement. Speaking at Whispering Hills Hotel Wednesday when he issued nomination certificates to contestants for various seats in Embu County, Dr Kumantha said President Kenyatta had not ignored DP when he attended national delegates’ conferences of other political parties that culminated in his endorsement. “We held our national delegates’ conference in December 2015 and agreed to support the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, the stand has not changed,” said Dr Kumantha. CANDIDATES The DP official, who is contesting the Embu governor’s seat, said the party will field five senate and five governorship candidates across the country. He said the party has already issued certificates to governor candidates in Embu, Nyeri, Isiolo, Wajir and Mandera counties. Five others had been cleared to run for senate seats, four woman representative, 30 MPs and over 200 for MCA. VISIONARY LEADERS Dr Kumantha said they settled on visionary leaders with track records and who have high chances of winning. He said they target to win at least 10 ward seats and then qualify for about five nominated MCA posts to ensure they have a stake in the county’s politics. “That way if I am elected governor I will have the majority of MCAs from DP which will enable the smooth running of government business in the House. We do not want a scenario similar to the current assembly where development lagged behind as MCAs fought the governor,” he said. The party will field Ms Josphine Nyambura for woman representative, Mr Ndwiga Kamunyoti (Runyenjes), Mr Njeru January (Manyatta) and Mr Nerbert Muriuki (Mbeere South).

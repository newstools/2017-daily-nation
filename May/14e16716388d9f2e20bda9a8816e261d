Catholic Bishops have raised concern over increased cases of abductions and killings of innocent Kenyans including children ahead of August 8 polls. Speaking in a Kakamega hotel under the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops, they appealed on the government to prioritise the security of Kenyans and their property despite the ongoing political campaigns. "We strongly condemn these barbaric acts and ask the government to take immediate action against the perpetrators," said Archbishop of Mombasa diocese Martin Kivuva. They spoke in the wake of the cold blood murder of Kapsoya MCA aspirant James Ratemo Nyambaneâ€™s three children in Uasin Gishu County. The children had been missing before they were found dead last Friday. Mr Enock Onsase, the prime suspect, was later on arrested and has been charged in court. Archbishop Kivuva said the church is also concerned about the use of excessive force, by security agents in the ongoing security operations in some parts of the country like Baringo and Laikipia.

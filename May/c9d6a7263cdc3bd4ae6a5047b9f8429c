A SKIN DETOX is a good way to revitalise a dull appearance and bring the glow back. Sometimes, your face may look drab and dull, despite your best efforts to make it brighter. This often happens when there is a cosmetic overload on your skin. The pores become clogged with grime while a layer of dead skin forms over time giving the skin a greyish cast. This film of dead skin is difficult to remove even after cleansing and toning daily because it is lodged within the skins epidermal layer. Using make up daily without a break makes the situation worse. The stale make up ends up accumulating within the skin causing it to become heavy. Sleeping with makeup on your face and then quickly cleaning and slathering more in the morning is the caiuse of this problem. Solution; The best way to get back your fresh, glowing skin is to go off all forms of cosmetics for a week. During this time, you should work on a deep cleansing routine daily to ensure that the pores are able to release all the grime that has accumulated in them over the previous months. Do not use any pore clogging oils or moisturiser as these will cause the grime to remain stuck inside the skin.Â  Carry out a mini facial every evening to slough off the dead skin and to quickly assist the new skin renewal. Here is a simple guide to carrying out your home facial: You will need: Boiling water in a bowl to steam, plain soap to cleanse, oatmeal bran to exfoliate, egg white and lemon to mask. Wash your face then follow with a steaming session of five minutes. Scrub your face for 2 minutes using the oatmeal, rinse and apply the egg white and lemon mask for 30 minutes. Follow this procedure daily and you will be pleasantly surprised at how much cleaner and glowing your skin will become.

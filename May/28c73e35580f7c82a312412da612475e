Former Assistant Minister for Local Government during the Kibaki administration, Mrs Betty Njeri Tett, has joined the race for Lamu West MP’s seat on a Democratic Congress (DC) party ticket. Mrs Tett is now the only woman candidate who will battle it out with four men for the constituency’s seat on August 8. Addressing journalists in Lamu Town over the weekend, Mrs Tett said she had reached the decision to vie for the seat in order to help redeem Lamu youth from the drug menace and also ensure employment opportunities are created for them. She said she is confident of winning the seat since she has all the required experience. Mrs Tett vied for the same seat in 2013 on a TNA ticket but was defeated by current MP Julius Ndegwa who vied on a Kenya National Congress (KNC) ticket. Mr Ndegwa is currently defending his seat on a Safina party ticket. LAMU RESIDENT “I consider myself as a Lamu resident since I have a firm in Telelani Village in Mpeketoni. That’s where I live at the moment. “I am also a scholar and have many years’ experience in leadership. “I have also worked with both national and international charitable organisations since 1985 to date, trying to help the less privileged in society including special programmes directed at drug addicts,” said Mrs Tett. Mrs Tett has a degree in political and social science from the University of Nairobi. Besides Mr Ndegwa, others with whom Mrs Tett will be fighting for the seat are Mr Rishad Amana of ODM, Mr Abdul Kassim Ahmed of Jubilee Party and Mr Stanley Muthama of Maendeleo Chap Chap.

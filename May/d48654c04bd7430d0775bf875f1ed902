The lakeside city of Kisumu is expected to come to a standstill as voters turn out to nominate a flagbearer for Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) in the race for Kisumu Central Parliamentary seat on Tuesday.Kisumu Central, one of the seven constituencies in Kisumu County, is an ODM bedrock, and a win in the party s primaries, all but guarantees one a seat in the next National Assembly, barring a political calamity.The other constituencies are Kisumu East, Kisumu West, Muhoroni, Nyakach, Nyando and Seme.Tuesday s repeat polls were ordered for on Friday by the High Court, at whose doorsteps the dispute arising from the April 25 botched party primaries was placed.The court s intervention on Friday followed dissatisfaction by some of the contestants with the verdict of the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT).NOMINATION CERTIFICATEJustice Francis Tuiyot overturned the tribunal s decision in which it ordered the party to give the incumbent, Mr Ken Obura, the nomination certificate.He ruled that the party conducts repeat polls after former TNA supremo Onyango Oloo, who defected to ODM in January, contested Mr Obura s win.The judge, faulted the tribunal for dismissing Mr Oloo s claims and directed ODM to repeat the nominations within 72 hours. Following this order, ODM National Elections Board on Saturday directed that the exercise be repeated. The exercise will only be for the Member of Parliament s position, whose earlier result was contested and ended up in court, read a statement by ODM director of communications Philip Etale.END CONFUSIONThe race for the seat pits Mr Obura against Mr Oloo and Gem Central MCA Fred Ouda. Other candidates who took part in the April 25 primaries are former Kisumu West MP Ken Nyagudi, ex-Kisumu Mayor Sam Okello, Richard Ogendo, Hesbon Odiero and Elphas Oyugi.The repeat primaries are expected to end the confusion that marred the contest after each of the three front-runners claimed victory.But even as the constituency now braces for the repeat poll, the party s branch officials are demanding that a direct ticket be issued to one of the aspirants for the seat saying they were ill-prepared for the exercise.The officials are drawn from the seven wards in the constituency. LACK OF PREPARATIONSLed by Kondele ODM chairperson, Mr George Anayo, the officials cited lack of proper preparations and limited time as the reasons for their fear ahead of the repeat primaries.They urged the ODM National Elections Board, to apply different legally approved nomination processes, in finding a suitable candidate to fly the party ticket before the set deadline. The time frame for vetting and selecting election officials is very limited and may serve as a basis for further legal challenges, said Mr Anayo.READ: How ODM primaries officials messed Nyanza polls He pointed out that most of the polling stations in which the exercise is to take place are schools that would be in session.Mr Anayo said the county elections board, that barely had time to settle after the last primaries, has limited resources, time and preparations for the repeat exercise.MANIPULATION The exercise may fall victim to manipulation from our rivals due to its isolated nature, said Mr Anayo.But even as doubts and concerns linger about the preparations for the repeat vote, each of the top candidates was exuding confidence he would capture the ticket. I don t have any problem with the ruling that we have a repeat poll. The people who voted for me are still alive and am confident they will turn out in large numbers and vote for me on Tuesday, Mr Ouda said.He blamed Mr Obura for the court action leading to the directive for fresh elections. I won fair and square and it s unfortunate that the people of Kisumu Central will be subjected to another election because of Mr Obura, Mr Ouda said.Mr Obura however, had explained that it was him who was declared winner by the returning officer, Mr Laban Bosire.VOTE FOR INTEGRITY I am the one who won the seat and that is why the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal directed that I be given the certificate, Mr Obura said. Mr Oloo, on his part asked the people of Kisumu Central to vote for integrity in the primaries. Let the people decide on the best candidate for the ticket to avoid further integrity queries that may arise and derail the course of the ODM party, Mr Oloo said, while warning the electorate against voting in Jubilee operatives . x + Kisumu Central MP Ken Obura acknowledges greetings from residents during a voter mobilization drive in Kisumu on January 25, 2017.

I am warning Jubilee that they will not steal elections, down here nor during the August elections, said Mr Oloo.CHOOSE THE BESTHe added: You have a second chance to choose the best for Kisumu Central who will be able to defend Mr Odinga s victory and government. Mr Obura played down Mr Oloo s assertions that he was Jubilee operative asking residents not to be misled by someone who until months ago was an official of the ruling party.The MP pegs his re-election bid on what he touts as his development record, citing construction of a secondary school, two police stations, and bursaries for over 500 students and the youth empowerment program in slums.FRONT-RUNNERHe says he was a better candidate and was a front-runner, rubbishing claims that it is a two horse race. Mr Oloo is no threat to me, in fact, he is the least of my worries. My competitors must be ready to lose very early in the morning, said Mr Obura.ODM National Elections Board in its statement said polling stations will open at 6am and close at 5pm during the fresh voting today. email print email print Former TNA Secretary General Onyango Oloo and Kisumu Central MP Ken Obura have been holding meetings to convince voters they are still loyal to ODM party.

At a time when youth unemployment has become such a huge national scourge, any openings must be fairly distributed. Whereas the National Police Service (NPS) has only 10,000 slots for new recruits, hordes of young people will be thronging various centres countrywide. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of those who qualify for the positions will be left out. In the past, corruption has been rife in recruitment to the police service. It is always an opportunity for crooks to prey on the desperation of jobless young people and their parents. There have been arrests and prosecution of the crooked fellows, but thanks to the great demand, the cheating persists. It is, therefore, encouraging to learn that the Independent Policing and Oversight Authority has sent its officials to monitor and ensure that the recruitment is done transparently. However, the onus is on the NPS, whose image has suffered a battering over the years for corruption, to ensure that its officers in charge of the drive do an exemplary job. As we have said before, people who cheat their way into the service cannot be expected to be of the moral uprightness that is required of the police. This is an opportunity for the service to demonstrate its commitment to not only recruiting the very best to be trained for this vital job but also to uphold ethical conduct and fairness in its serving and future officers.

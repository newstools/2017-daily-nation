Hello Mr Kitoto,I have been in a relationship with a man I love for four years and we promised to get married as soon as we are ready. We have been getting along fine but of late, we have been having issues that we are finding hard to resolve yet any time I express concern about an issue affecting us, he avoids discussing it, saying that I should not be bothered by love and any related matters. He postpones any issue worth discussing, which has left me confused. Could he be taking me for a ride? Please help. Hi,Conflict management is key to growing a successful relationship. However, personality traits are some of the most important determinants of the way people manage conflicts. Among the personality types are those who are not very expressive in nature and so prefer to communicate in other ways other than direct confrontation. In many cases, spouses can come across as cold, uncaring, and distant procrastinators. If we come out too strongly, it is most likely that they will keep their feelings to themselves.The safest thing for you to do is to determine where your relationship stands. I suggest that you discover each other s love language.I recommend Gary Chapman s The Five Love Languages as a great place to start. You will discover that all it requires is to allow each other to speak their love language. email print email print

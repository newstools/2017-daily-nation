Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua is yet to announce his next political move after he was handed a humiliating defeat in the Jubilee Party primaries by Mr Lee Kinyanjui. A press conference called yesterday by his communication team was called off at the last minute. It is still not clear if he will run as an independent.

Ngozi Girls, the Msambweni District Secondary Schools netball and handball champions will miss the Kwale County Term Two A Games after heavy rains cut off  access to the institution. This happened as Kwale County girls football under-16 champions Kwale Girls went berserk scoring 31 goals in two matches as the games got underway at Samburu and They secondary schools in Kinango sub county. Msambweni Secondary Schools Sports Association Chairman Paul Katua said the heavy rains currently being experienced at the Coast cut off  the school after flooding at Tsuini along Lunga Lunga - Vanga road which is the only route to school. “It’s very sad that Ngozi Girls, who have some of the best talents in Kwale, have to miss this games due to the school being inaccessible by road,” he said. At Samburu, football girls under-16 defending champions Kwale girls hammered Mnyenzeni Secondary 15-0b before crushing Diani Babla secondary 16-0 to stay on course for the defence of their title. Catherine Aringo, who hit five goals past Mnyenzeni goalkeeper, was at it again pumping in six against Babla while other scorers were Gladys Chekophe,Baya Saumu, Daisy Malingi and Milka Omondi.

Koyonzo’s Silas Wanzala touched down a converted try for a 7-5 half time lead.  After the breather Kakamega’s Tony Oketch touchdown down for the lead. But Joseph Odipo and Silas Shiundu landed over to put the game beyond the pre-match favourites. Defending champions St Peter’s Mumias thrashed Ingotse Secondary School 59-0.

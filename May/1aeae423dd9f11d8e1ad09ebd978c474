Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has assured residents of security during Ramadhan. Mr Marwa said stringent measures have been put in place to enhance safety during the celebration and ahead of the General Election. Speaking to journalists before flagging off a peace caravan at Bamburi Mwisho, Mr Marwa warned criminals not to take advantage of the month of fasting to commit crime. NIGHT PATROLS Mr Marwa said that patrols would be frequent, at the same time cautioning officers to carry out their duties within the legal confines. "Let us carry out patrols with consideration that this is a holy month and that we need to give our brothers and sisters sufficient time for worship. "We will not allow the criminal gangs or police to disrupt peace for the faithful," he said. INCITEMENT Accompanied by Mombasa Commissioner Evans Achoki, and Administration police commander Nelson Masengeli, he also cautioned politicians against hate speech and inciting youth to cause violence. Those found going against the directive will be prosecuted. "Anybody regardless of who you are - be it a governor, an MP or even a billionaire -, if you disrupt peace and issue threats the law will deal with you on the spot. "We have issued sufficient instructions to our security agents."

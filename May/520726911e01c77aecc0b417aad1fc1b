Nairobi governor has warned the electoral commission not to use its recent reshuffle of staff to deny Kenyans there will during the August 8 polls. Dr Evans Kidero said that the National Super Alliance (Nasa) was keenly looking at the reshuffles made to determine its motive adding that they would not hesitate to resist it should they find any ulterior motive. “We are looking at this list of the new returning officers very carefully and determining what they mean or portend but any attempt to deny the people of Kenya their will, will be met with all the forces of resistance,” said Dr Kidero while addressing the media on Saturday at Eastleigh Seventh Day Adventist Church. He said that the Opposition had made a statement on Friday while at Kasarani and they would stand by it. The governor also defended the insistence by the Opposition to establish a parallel tallying centre saying that the move was not meant to undermine the role of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) explaining that it will only serve to bring clarity in case of any dispute. “Even in these nominations, the tribunals of Jubilee Party and that of ODM depended on parallel tallying to determine the cases that they got,” he said. He insisted that election results should be announced at the constituency level and no power should be given to the IEBC’s chairman or executive to alter such results. “We do not want to cry wolf so long as the votes are counted and announced at the constituency and there is parallel tallying. “So long as parallel tallying takes place and results announced at the constituency, we do not have much of a problem except there are certain areas where they will be inflating the votes,” said the governor.   ODM MCA who wanted Governor Kidero impeached was voted out. #ElectionsKE

Kakamega residents were on Friday eagerly awaiting the grand homecoming of Samuel Abisai, the latest millionaire in town. The 28-year-old made history this week after winning Sh221,331,602 million to become the first ever SportsPesa Mega Jackpot winner. His father Abisai Mabunda, 66, was lost for words about his son’s achievement when the Nation caught up with him at the Kakamega County market. Mr Mabunda, a trader at the market for the last 46 years, has been eking out a living by selling ropes to tether their cows, sheep and goats. He lives in the little known Sichirai village and comes from Ebukanga Munjiti in Emuhaya. At first, he could not find words to express his joy and said his son had made him a very proud father. Abisai’s mother Margaret Mabunda was busy sprucing up the family home in Sichirai village in preparation to welcome her son. “I’m still waiting for communication from him on the preparations for his homecoming but we are all set to accord him a very warm welcome,” said Mzee Mabunda. He added he wanted his son to get advice from financial experts on how he would invest his huge fortune to lift the family. Mr Abisai is expected to make his grand homecoming on Saturday in an elaborate ceremony at Bukhungu Stadium. “People of Kakamega must feel the effect of his win. He is talking of building a sports academy,” said SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri. Among those expected at the fete include Elimah Khanaitsa, who pocketed Sh22 million in January of last year.

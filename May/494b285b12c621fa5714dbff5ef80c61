Roysambu MP Waihenya Ndirangu has been declared the winner of the Jubilee repeat primary election held Thursday Mr Ndirangu garnered 5,926 votes to clinch the Jubilee ticket. His closest competitor was Mr Lee Muchiri who got 2,104 votes. After the returning officer announced the final tally at around midnight, Mr Ndiranguâ€™s supporters burst into song and dance. The Political Parties Disputes Tribunal on Wednesday ordered the repeat poll for Roysambu Constituency after the first one was found not to have been free and fair. Mr Ndirangu had insisted that he won in the first primary poll that was nullified. But the tribunal heard that the returning officer in the nomination disowned the whole process and fled, fearing for his life. He reported his fears at Kasarani Police Station. Now Mr Ndirangu will fly the Jubilee ticket in the August 8 elections.

Nakuru County Secretary Joseph Motari got a temporary reprieve after a court approved a suit blocking his sacking over a staff hiring saga. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Stephen Radido said the court has jurisdiction to hear the matter that was placed before it by a Nakuru businessman seeking to prevent the sacking of Mr Motari and another top official. On June 29 last year, the county assembly adopted a report by a special House committee that was appointed to look into the alleged illegal hiring of staff. "Also, according to the Constitution, any citizen has the right to file a petition," Judge Radido ruled. MISCHIEF OF OFFICIALS After investigating, the committee recommended the immediate sacking of Mr Motari and Public Service Management Chief Officer Philip Sigei after establishing that the hiring process was not scrupulously done. The application by the assembly's lawyer sought to stop the court from hearing the case, arguing that it has no authority. Late last year, the businessman, Shadrack Koskei, through his lawyer Wilfred Konosi, sued the assembly claiming it irregularly extended its sittings on June 29 when the report recommending the sacking of the duo was tabled. Mr Koskei argued that the assemblyâ€™s ad hoc committee erred when it concluded hearings before summoning Governor Kinuthia Mbugua, who, he claimed, was adversely mentioned in the probe. PROTECTING MOTARI The businessman further said that the assembly usurped the mandate of the Public Service Board and hence the implementation of the report would be unlawful. He also sued the Public Service Board. Mr Koskei is seeking orders declaring the report illegal and wants the court to shelter the officials from being laid off. The case will be mentioned on June 19.

Nearly 40 people have been killed in a wave of violence in Kitui County in the past one year that appears not to have attracted any serious official attention. The latest victims are two people killed by suspected Somali bandits. The poor response is perhaps because this region has always been prone to similar attacks. However, it is the duty of the government to protect all Kenyans and their property and the failure to deal with this menace smacks of an unforgivable dereliction of duty. BATTLE-HARDENED BANDITS The attackers are clearly not herdsmen using crude weapons such as spears and machetes, but crooks wielding sophisticated weapons and well-versed in tactics of plunder. It would be foolhardy to expect villagers to counter these apparently battle-hardened bandits. Since last June, the death toll has risen to 35, with many other people maimed and hundreds displaced from their homes. According to the local police boss, the suspected killers are herdsmen, who have encroached on farms. FEEL ABANDONED We sympathise with the villagers, who feel abandoned by the government. This must not be allowed to go on any longer. Though an assurance by the local police chief that a security operation is underway to flush out the raiders is welcome, there is a need for some urgency here. The security team on the ground must be beefed up and the operation speeded up to prevent new attacks.

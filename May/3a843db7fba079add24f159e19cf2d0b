The second edition of Victoria Cup will now take place from July 6 to 8 in Uganda.The event, an International Test match between Kenya and Uganda, had initially been programmed for early June, but the Uganda Golf Union requested for a later date in order to source for sponsorship.The inaugural event was held at Muthaiga Golf Club on June 1 last year where the hosts Kenya emerged victorious. We agreed with Uganda for the new date so that we have a proper tournament with a good sponsorship which I believe they have managed to get, out-going Kenya Golf Union (KGU) chairman Muchau Githiaka said.He said selection of Kenya s team for the Victoria Cup will be finalised during a meeting next week. The team will probably be picked after the last Kenya Amateur Golf Championship series in June which will be the Kenya Amateur Matchplay Championship scheduled for June 14 to 17 at Karen Country Club, he said.The winner of the Matchplay Championship will qualify to play in the 2018 Barclays Kenya Open at Muthaiga Golf Club.Meanwhile, the KGU chairman confirmed that the local professionals will participate in the KGU Chairman s Prize next weekend at Vet Lab Sports Club.The pros will play on May 18 and 19 along with amateurs who will not be in position to play in the main event on May 20.The event will mark the end of Githiaka s term which officially ends after the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 26 at Muthaiga Golf Club.Meanwhile, Tanzania Golf Union (TGU) confirmed the dates for this year s East Africa Challenge Cup which will now take place at Kilimanjaro Golf and Wildlife Estate popularly known as KiliGolf from August 21 to 25.The David Jones-designed course is situated Usa River, about 30km from Arusha on the Arusha/Moshi highway. email print email print

LONDON Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose has undergone exploratory surgery on his left knee after a setback in his recovery, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday. The England international, 26, sustained medial ligament damage during Tottenham's 0-0 draw at Sunderland on January 31. He had been expected to return before the end of the season, but with the rehabilitation process taking longer than expected, he has gone under the knife and will not be back until next season. "We can confirm that Danny Rose has undergone exploratory surgery on his left knee today," Spurs said on their official Twitter account. "He recently returned to training, however, the problem has not resolved fully, therefore a decision has been made to proceed to surgery. He will now return to action next season." Wales international Ben Davies has been deputising at left-back in Rose's absence. Spurs' 2-1 win over Manchester United last weekend confirmed they will finish second behind champions Chelsea. They visit Leicester City on Thursday and finish the season at relegated Hull City on Sunday.   Falcao is suspected of failing to correctly declare Sh600 million of income.

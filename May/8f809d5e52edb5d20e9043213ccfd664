Runaway leaders Posta Rangers maintained their unbeaten run in the SportsPesa Premier League with a narrow 1-0 win over Sofapaka in a closely contested match at Afraha Stadium on Saturday. The Sammy "Pamzo" Omollo-coached Rangers seemed to muster the mud bath Afraha pitch as they launched a series of attacks but were not lucky enough to score in the opening stages of the match. Posta's best chance came at the quarter hour mark when Edwin Mwaura's cross found Dennis Mukaisi, but the veteran striker shot wide when scoring was easier. As the game swung from end-to-end, the two goalkeepers were reduced to spectators as neither side made any inroads as their boots were weighed down by the mud. After the interval Omollo made two changes, bringing in John Nairuka and Rodgers Ochieng for Edwin Mwaura and Joseph Nyaga. With 10 minutes to go, Nairuka controlled the ball on the right flank and outpaced his marker before lifting a cross which was superbly executed by Mukaisi for his third goal of the season. Omollo then injected more power in the side after resting Geoffrey Kataka for Gerald Obwoge, and Rangers pinned their opponents in their own half in the last 10 minutes of the game. Sofapaka coach Sam Ssimbwa brought in Ezekiel Okare, Brian Magonya and John Walubuka and rested Charles Okwemba, Paul Odhiambo and Maurice Odipo but this hardly changed their fortunes. "Sofapaka were strong in the first 45 minutes and pinned us in our own half but our substitutes changed the game and it worked to our advantage," Posta coach Sammy "Pamzo" Omollo said. On the opposite side Sofapaka coach Sam Ssimbwa conceded defeat saying it was a balanced match. "We had our own share of chances but failed to utilise them while they had one and it made the difference," said Ssimbwa.   Humphrey Mieno struck the winner in the 33rd minute.

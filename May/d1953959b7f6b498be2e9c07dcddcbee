Police officers have denied any involvement in the "disappearance" of three men arrested after the burial of a suspected female gangster. The mother of one of the men said they were taken away on Friday evening in different vehicles but were not booked at any station in Murang'a County. The youth were attending the burial of 18-year-old Claire Njoki Kiboi on Thursday. NO OPERATION They were identified as Samuel Kihoro, Samuel Maramu and Amos Ngaire. One was her in-law and the others are her cousins. They are from Kayole, Nairobi, where Ms Kiboi lived with her boyfriend Mwanii, a suspected gangster. Police officers in Murang'a denied arresting the youth. Also, Nairobi Police commander Japheth Koome and Head of Special Crime Intervention Noah Katumo said they were not aware of any operation conducted by their officers about the matter. MOTHER'S REQUEST The mother of one of those arrested told the Nation that she had not heard from the police or her son. She insisted those who took away the three identified themselves as police officers. “We do not know where or why they were taken. We were only attending a burial and we did not know anything about criminals,” she said. She appealed to the government to help trace her son and the other two. NO ARREST Ms Kiboi's relatives in Kambirwa, where she was buried, had said that they would record a statement with the police. The Murang'a Director of Criminal Investigations Julius Rutere said he was not privy to whether the three were arrested. "No one has reported the incident. I am also not aware about any raid carried out by officers from this county," he said. Ms Kiboi's funeral was filled with tension as the presence of youths from Kayole caused anxiety among mourners. She was killed in Kayole last week along with her four accomplices, who were suspected members of Gaza gang.   Police raid her house hours after burial, arrest three men.

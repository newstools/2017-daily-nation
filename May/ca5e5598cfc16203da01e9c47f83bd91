The training of teachers on the new curriculum kicked off today, with about 2,000 of them taking part countrywide. In Nairobi, the training started at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), where senior education officials were instructed on the new guidelines. The week-long training will be in two phases — two-day training sessions for senior officials who will supervise its implementation and four-day sessions for teachers who will oversee the programme.

He said teachers from 10 selected schools in the counties will report on Wednesday, and they will be trained until Saturday. SYLLABUS ROLLOUTAccording to curriculum implementation guidelines produced by the KICD, the process is inclusive and takes into account teaching conditions at special-needs schools. Upon completing their training, teachers are expected to start teaching the curriculum on May 29. The pilot phase will take place at 470 schools countrywide. Its rollout is expected to start early next year in Standards One and Two.

Africa and African Games 10,000m champion Alice Aprot displayed class to retain her 10,000m title as the Kenya Prisons Service Athletics Championships drew to a close Saturday at Nyayo National Stadium. Africa 5,000m silver medallist Winfred Kimitei ruled the roost in men’s 5,000m as Olympic 800m bronze medallist Margaret Nyairera, who is gunning for speed, successfully changed tact to claim women’s 200m and 400m races respectively. Competing for Coast region, Nyairera, who is also the Africa Cross Country champion and finished fourth in 10,000m at the Rio Olympics, clocked 32 minutes and 13.4 seconds to win the 25-lap race. Aprot, fresh from winning silver at the World Cross Country Championship in March in Kampala, beat Pauline Wangui from North Eastern and Nyanza’s Maureen Chepkemoi in 33:47.2 and 34:13.8 respectively. “It was a good race but I have not trained well since the World Cross Country,” said Aprot. “I have been taking care of my sick father for the last one month and he is a bit better now.” Aprot said she was focused on increasing her intensity in training as she prepares for the National trials and ultimately the World Championships in London. “Long distance races don’t have many events in Diamond League but I hope to compete in some,” said Aprot. Kimitei timed 13:37.2 to retain men’s 5,000m title, beating Cornelius Kangogo, who had won the 10,000m race the previous day, to second in 13:38.9 as Fredrick Kipkosgei settled third in 13:39.1. Nancy Nzisa won the women’s 5,000m in 16:06.9, beating 2016 Paris Marathon champion Visiline Jepkesho (16:10.8) and Pamela Cherotich (16:23.6). Nyairera, who is the Africa 400m silver medallist and World Indoor 800m bronze medallist, won the 200m in 24.1 before wrapping up a double in 400m race in 52.5. National 400m hurdles champion Maureen Jelagat made a return from injury with victory in her specialty in 62.1.   Kipchoge will partner with the 2012 Olympic marathon silver medallist Kipsang.

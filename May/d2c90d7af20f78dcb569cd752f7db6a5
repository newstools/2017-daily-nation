Aspirants on various party tickets and independent nominees may have gone past the first hurdle but they may not be out of the woods yet.Ahead of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) nominations that start on May 28, the aspirants backgrounds will be scrutinised by no less than 16 agencies under the auspices of the Chapter Six Working Group on Election Preparedness in line with the guidelines published by the Attorney General Githu Muigai on March 22.The 16 consist of the Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General and Department of Justice, IEBC, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission, Directorate of Criminal Investigations, Office of the Registrar of Political Parties, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Public Service Commission, Higher Education Loans Board (Helb), Kenya Revenue Authority, Commission for University Education, Kenya National Examination Council, Department of Immigration, the Official Receiver, Credit Information Sharing Association of Kenya and professional bodies. The overall goal of this initiative is to ensure that only qualified candidates and who espouse integrity values are elected into public office, in order to facilitate the realisation of the ideals of our Constitution and Kenya Vision 2030, Prof Muigai had notified the public then.CONSTANT COMMUNICATIONTherefore, as political parties will be submitting their list of nominees until May 14, the IEBC will likely be in constant communication with the other institutions under the Working Group to ensure that those who finally end up on the ballot are the ones that tick all the 13 boxes on the Leadership and Integrity checklist.Top on the list is the academic qualifications. According to the checklist, all the presidential aspirants and their deputies, as well as those for gubernatorial and their running mates must hold at least a university degree.According to the Working Group, it is not just the piece of paper but the academic degree must be genuine, valid, (and) if issued by a foreign university, it must be recognised in Kenya. It has once happened before in February 2013 when then TNA s Kajiado gubernatorial aspirant Taraiya ole Kores had his nomination certificate nullified by the court following a letter from the Commission for Higher Education (CHE), which had discredited his university education credentials from Universidad Empressrial Del Costa Rica.An unlucky Mr Kores again lost the recent Jubilee Party nominations to former Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of Government Joseph ole Lenku for the same seat, despite having obtained a degree from Mount Kenya University.JOHO'S QUALIFICATIONSMeanwhile, Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho s academic qualifications have also continued to be a subject of public debate. High Court Judge Chacha Mwita in April, in declining to grant a request by a petitioner Abdalla Juma to have Mr Joho barred from contesting for not meeting the requisite educational qualifications to be a governor, had stated that it was the IEBC s mandate to make the determination. In the petition, the Commission for Higher Education and Kampala International University were listed as interested parties.While Mr Kores 2013 disappointment and debate around Mr Joho s academic qualifications have been the major ones, there could be many more that some aspirants will be forwarding to the IEBC.An aspirant who goes past the academic hurdle must also satisfy the moral and ethical requirements set out in law. A candidate must not have violated any of the requirements in Section 13 of the Leadership and Integrity Act (LIA), which include dishonesty in conduct of public affairs, abuse of office, inaccurate representation of information to the public, misuse of public resources, discrimination of persons, falsification of records, engaging in actions which would lead to removal from membership of a professional body, commission of an offence under Part XV and XVI of the Penal Code, commission of any offence under the Sexual Offences Act, 2006, the Children s Act 2008 or the Counter-Trafficking in Persons Act, 2010, the Working Group said.SET THRESHOLDHowever, while locking out an aspirant who does not meet academic qualifications may be easy, this will certainly be challenging bearing in mind the threshold that the High Court set in the 2013 landmark ruling that cleared the way for then Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto to contest in that year's General Election despite both facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court.A five-judge bench had made it clear that although the ICC had committed their cases to trial, presumption of innocence will continue to prevail until the conclusion of the case.The ruling in effect lowered the integrity threshold by stating that only a conviction could be a reason to bar anyone from contesting.Other hurdles include aspirants must not be State officers or other public officer, other than a Member of Parliament; or a Member of the County Assembly; must be a citizen of Kenya for at least 10 years with the presidential aspirants required to be citizens by birth; and that an aspirant must not hold dual citizenship. email print email print

The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) has directed its members in insecurity-prone Laikipia West, near the Baringo boarder, to withdraw their services until the government assures their safety. Laikipia County Kuppet Executive Secretary Ndung’u Wangenye instructed the 60 teachers to leave the schools, a move that will paralyse learning activities in the region. He said security had deteriorated in the area and accused police of doing little as armed bandits continue to terrorise residents. There were demonstrations on Thursday morning at Rubere, Matuiku, Mahwa, Rukore, Milimani and Mihuri secondary schools after parents withdrew their children and demanded better security at the schools. TENSION The teachers also protested against insecurity as tension remained high in the area. Mr Wangenye said special forces deployed to drive out illegal herders and the armed bandits has not helped as incidents of cattle rustling had resumed. “Bandits have destabilised all social and economic activities in Laikipia. I have instructed teachers in the county where there are security concerns to boycott work effective today,” Mr Wangenye told the Nation. He said a 19-year-old woman was attacked and raped on Wednesday night by the suspected bandits, who fired in the air to scare residents. “The attackers have made this area a shooting playground. Residents have been rendered poor after their farms were invaded and crops destroyed by armed illegal herders. The invaders now want to displace them. “The situation is moving from bad to worse and the State must take full responsibility,” said the irate Mr Wangenye. Police are pursuing the lawbreakers after daring bandits disrupted a public meeting in the area on Tuesday.   Residents block Nyahururu-Ol Ng’arua road to protest against insecurity.

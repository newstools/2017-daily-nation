Mike Lekalaile from Kenya Police Service (KPS) Nairobi Area last weekend weathered a tough course to retain his Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) Full-bore Shoot title at the KDF Shooting Range, Laikipia.The inspector police based at Eastleigh mastered the rainy and occasionally dark course to down a record 514 points comprising 32 vee-bulls to triumph, beating a field of 70.What perhaps spurred Lekalaile to victory was his impressive long range haul of 280.15 drawn from 800m and 900m distances that were repeated twice. The Super X Class firer carded 71.4 from the first 800m and 67.1 from the second round over the same distance before returning 69.5 and 63.5 respectively at 900m. Lekalaile, who was bolstered by an aggregate of 234.17 from short range, relegated Sarah Sintoi from General Service Unit (GSU) to Super X 1 class honours. The rains proved problematic with the dark course making visibility difficult but my experience did the trick, said Lekalaile adding that the victory gives him a good leverage ahead of Kenya Open due May 20-27 at the same range.Sintoi returned an aggregate 507.15 made of 273.5 from long and 234.10 from short range to win the Super X category, beating teammate Simon Ndambuki on 504.31 made of 267.11 and 237.20.Besides Sintoi, who is the only Super X Class shooter in the country apart from Farhiya Mohammed from KDF, the women firers arguably had a good outing in the KDF shoot. GSU s Grace Rantile downed 510.36 to win O Class, beating Wilfred Omete from Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) on 490.26 while Clifford Kiptanui from GSU won X Class on 503.31, beating Eudicas Nyagah from KPS Nairobi Area on 488.24.Kenya Police Service champion Irene Wanjiku, who comes from GSU, was the best lady firer on 496.31 drawn from 2764.17 and 232.16 respectively. email print email print

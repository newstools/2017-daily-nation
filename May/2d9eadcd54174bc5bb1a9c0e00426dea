Regina Kaveke, a member of Nyali Golf and Country Club, at the weekend beat a big field of 140 golfers drawn from most the Coast-based clubs to claim the overall prize during the AAR Insurance Golf Tournament title at the par 71 Nyali course.Kaveke carded 15 points in the first nine and she appeared out of the race for the top prize. She, however, put up a spirited fight at the back nine where she produced an impressive 23 points for a total of 38 points. Playing in the morning was tough because of the rain. The course was playing rather long but I had to fight on and I am happy I emerged the overall. It feels great beating all these great players, said Kaveke after receiving her prize from AAR Insurance managing director Caroline Munene. Taking the men s first prize was handicap nine Dinesh Sasan who combined 16 and 21 for 37 points to win ahead of veteran golfer Patrick Munyao who is the father of Coast s leading amateur golfers Daniel Nduva and George Munyao.

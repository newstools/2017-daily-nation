Sirisia ODM parliamentary aspirant Moses Nandalwe has denied blocking deputy president William Ruto’s convoy on Webuye-Kitale road at weekend. On Sunday, a group of rowdy residents tried to block the DP between Misiku and Kamukuywa by burning tyres on the road. Mr Ruto, who had been scheduled to address Jubilee Party supporters at Amutala stadium in Kimilili was forced to arrive late at the stadium following the chaos. Mr Nandwale was then blamed for the chaos after a vehicle bearing his campaign posters was spotted within the area. However, while being interviewed on a local vernacular radio station, the former university students’ leader denied he was involved in the chaos. But he was hard-pressed to explain why his official vehicle was spotted far away from his constituency explaining that maybe his driver had gone to fuel it. "The people of Sirisia are my witnesses as I was on the ground from morning to evening. I am being linked to the chaos by my opponent who is in jubilee," Nandalwe said. Some listeners who called the station claiming to e from Sirisia also tried to defend him against the accusations.

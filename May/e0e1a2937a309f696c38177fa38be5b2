Deputy President William Ruto was in Migori County on Friday where he urged the Kuria community to support the Jubilee government. He said Jubilee has solutions for problems facing Kenyans. Mr Ruto urged the community not to gamble with their votes by supporting Opposition parties, which have no agenda for the country. The Deputy President was speaking at Mabera grounds in Kuria West Constituency, Migori County on Friday. He said he was confident that the Jubilee Party would win in the August elections with a landslide because of its development record across the country. He also said the government will start paying fees for secondary school students from January 2018. He said the move is aimed at reducing dropout rates and increase enrolment in secondary schools. The Deputy President was accompanied by MPs Mathias Robi (Kuria West), Mary Emase (Teso South) and Rachel Shebesh (Woman Rep, Nairobi). He said the soaring prices of basic commodities including maize flour has been caused by prolonged drought in the country and wondered why Opposition leaders were politicising the issue. “As government, we are doing our best to solve the problem within the shortest time possible. Our colleagues in the Opposition are opportunists who take advantage of such situations to mislead Kenyans that they have solutions to such problems,” said Mr Ruto. He alleged that the Opposition leaders only thrive on propaganda and falsehoods with the intention of winning support from Kenyans. The Deputy President had earlier addressed residents in Gokeharaka Primary School and Nyametaburo Secondary School grounds. He later launched the construction of Motemorabu -Masaba road.

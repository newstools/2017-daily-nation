Champions Tusker on Wednesday continued their resurgence with a 2-0 win over Zoo Kericho in their SportPesa Premier League match at the Kericho Green Stadium. George Mandela gave the brewers the lead in the 25th minute before Humphrey Mieno – scorer of Tusker’s goal in their 1-0 over Kakamega Homeboyz on Saturday – doubled their lead a minute to the break. Apart from a sloppy start that saw the hosts test goalkeeper Duncan Ochieng twice in the opening 20 minutes, the brewers were much in control for the better part of the match. Mandela, starting in place of Abdul Hassan from Saturday's team, drew first blood for the brewers with a neatly taken goal. With Cersidy Okeyo out with a thigh strain, Tusker coach George Nsimbe restored Hashim Sempala into the defensive midfield position with Mandela, Jackson Macharia and Mieno forming the defensive quartet. Mandela headed in the opener from Collins Shivachi's cross to break the deadlock. Nicholas Kipkirui and Bernard Odhiambo also had chances to level the scores for the hosts but the Tusker backline stood firm. With a minute to the break, Macharia and Mieno exchanged passes outside the area before the former teed up the Kenyan international to slot home past Vincent Misikhu in Zoo's goal. The champions brought in Hassan for Macharia before Ekaliani Ndolo replaced Mike Khamati as Nsimbe went for the kill. His opposite number Sammy Okoth introduced Kepha Ondati for Leonard Mmata while Tusker were forced to withdraw Mieno who seemed to be struggling with a hamstring injury for Clifford Alwanga. The win takes the brewers to forth on the log on 18 points, four adrift leaders Posta Rangers. Zoo's hunt for their first home win of the season continues.

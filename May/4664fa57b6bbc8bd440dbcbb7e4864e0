Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua has denied reports that he has ditched the Jubilee Party so as to defend his seat as an independent candidate in the August 8 elections. In a statement issued by his communications director Eddy Kimani, the governor said he is confident that his appeal challenging the election of former National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) chairman Lee Kinyanjui in the Jubilee nominations will be dealt with in a free, fair and transparent manner. “Reports in sections of the media that I am planning to run as an independent candidate are false, probably engineered by my opponent. I have not given the pronouncement,” stated Governor Mbugua. He said he will respect the will of the people of Nakuru, adding that he will consult them before deciding on the way forward. SUPPORT UHURU Mr Mbugua also reiterated that his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election bid remains firm. “I strongly support President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election bid ahead of the August 8 general election,” said Governor Mbugua. Governor Mbugua launched an appeal after Mr Kinyanjui, a former Nakuru Town MP, was declared the winner in last week’s primaries. The governor, who described the primaries a sham, said he lost unfairly to Mr Kinyanjui. Mr Kinyanjui was declared the winner by returning officer Jepta Rono after garnering 216,385 votes against Governor Mbugua's 150,137. The governor spent most of Tuesday evening at the Jubilee Party headquarters in Nairobi awaiting news on his appeal. The appeals tribunal is scheduled to issue its ruling on Friday.   Mr Kinyanjui polled 216,385 votes against Mr Mbugua’s 150,137 in the primaries. #ElectionsKE

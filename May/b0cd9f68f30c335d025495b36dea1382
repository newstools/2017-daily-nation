Aidan O'Brien's, Winter (Wayne Lordan 9-1), beat compatriot, Rhododendron, in the Qipco 1000 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket on Sunday. Rhododendron (Ryan Moore 5-4), endured a troubled passage via Hydrangea's wonderings, while Winter managed to stray nicely wide, far from harassment. Winter went ahead entering 200m, and just had to keep going for the ultimate prize with 2 lengths credit. Daban (Frankie Dettori 5-1), and Talaayeb (Jim Crowley 11-1), really ran a strong race, just behind the leaders. Aidan O'Brien's astonishing dominance of top-tier Classics, never abates. He has established a stranglehold, putting him among the greatest trainers ever.

Isiolo Boys High School pulled a big surprise by winning the Under-16 football title during Eastern Region Secondary Schools Term Two ‘A’ games at the weekend. The team has never represented the region at the nationals and this year they were determined to set a new record in the region. The Northern Kenya-based school started their fight for the trophy by beating all the teams from the preliminaries to semi-finals. They met Nguutini Boys High School from Kitui County at the finals, winning 2-1 to bag the regional title at Meru School on Saturday. ISIOLO SCORED FIRST The tough final match saw the champions get their first goal during the first half through striker Diba Guyo after pass from the team’s captain Fara Abdi. Nguutini equalised minutes after the second half. Isiolo Boys managed to secure the trophy after the team’s captain netted their second and final goal of the match few minutes before the final whistle was blown. The team’s coach Abednego Munyoki said the win was due to the commitment of both players and the school’s administration which provided all they required for their match practice. Munyoki is currently preparing his team to battle it out at the nationals set for Shanzu and Shimo la Tewa High schools, as they look to go all the way to winning this year’s national title. “We met Nguutini Boys in the preliminaries and won despite facing a tough opponent. We were prepared to meet them at the final because we had not faced a strong team like them,” the coach said. Last year, the school represented Isiolo County at the regional games held at Kangaru School in Embu County but were sent home in the preliminaries.   Upsets mark twilight of regional games across the country.

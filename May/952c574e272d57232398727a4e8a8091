MONACO Kimi Raikkonen secured his first pole position for nine years on Saturday when he outpaced his Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel in a dramatic qualifying session for Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix. The 37-year-old Finn, who had not taken pole position for 128 races stretching back to 2008, dominated the afternoon's action to clock a fastest lap of one minute and 12.178 seconds. That left him 0.043 seconds ahead of the world championship leader and three-time champion Vettel who in turn was just two-thousandths of a second faster than third-placed Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes. The Finn's Mercedes team-mate, Briton Lewis Hamilton, failed to make progress from Q2 and missed the cut for the top-10 shoot-out. He qualified 14th after a miserable afternoon. Dutch teenager Max Verstappen took fourth place ahead of his Red Bull team-mate, Australian Daniel Ricciardo, Spaniard Carlos Sainz of Toro Rosso, Mexican Sergio Perez of Force India and Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Haas. Briton Jenson Button, back from retirement to replace two-time champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso, who is racing in the Indianapolis 500, was ninth for McLaren Honda ahead of his team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne. However, Button has a 15-place grid penalty for engine replacements and that is expected to lift Hamilton up to 13th.   Alonso's gamble was looking good as he prepared to swap one iconic venue for another on Sunday.

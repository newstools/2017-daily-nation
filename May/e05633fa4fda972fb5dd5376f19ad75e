Mrs Gichuhi makes history as the first person of African descent to make it to Australia’s federal Parliament. BOB DAY She will replacing Bob Day, a senator whose election was nullified by an Australian court in April. Mr Day lost the seat after it was established that he was ineligible to vie in the July 2016 elections.

However, days before her swearing-in, the party merged with the Australian Conservatives and Mrs Gichuhi will now be in the Senate as an independent.

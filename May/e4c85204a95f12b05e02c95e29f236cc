Auditor-General Edward Ouko has cited political interference as a major impediment to his office’s independence. Mr Ouko told his African peers at a Nairobi meeting Monday that the political class and the executive were not pleased with his work of exposing corruption in Kenya, culminating in a bid to oust him from office. His remarks come two months after the High Court ordered the National Assembly’s Finance Committee to halt hearing a petition seeking his ouster on abuse of office and procurement breaches claims. Mr Ouko has presented annual reports revealing billions of shillings of taxpayers’ money that cannot be adequately accounted for. His remarks come two months after the High court ordered Parliament Finance Committee to halt hearing a petition seeking ouster of Mr Ouko on abuse of office and procurement breaches claims. “Political interference are some of the things we have been struggling with. You may recall there was an attempt to oust me from office just the other day,” Mr Ouko said. Early last month, State House accused Mr Ouko of breaching the Constitution by failing to submit progress reports to President Uhuru Kenyatta. Article 254(1) requires the Auditor-General as the holder of an independent office to submit, as soon as is practicable after the end of the year, a report to the President and Parliament.

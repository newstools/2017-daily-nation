The highly anticipated SportPesa Premier League clash between traditional arch-rivals AFC Leopards against Gor Mahia has been postponed indefinitely following security concerns. This announcement was contained in a brief media release sent to newsrooms by the Kenyan Premier League Limited Tuesday evening. The game was scheduled for this Sunday at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru County. The KPL also confirmed the clash, famously billed as the “Mashemeji derby”, will only be played at a time at a time either the Nyayo National Stadium or the Moi international Sports Centre, Kasarani, is available. These two Nairobi venues are currently undergoing government-commissioned renovations in readiness to host both the IAAF World Under-18 Championship and the Africa Nations Championship football tournament in July this year and January/February next year, respectively. In an interview last week, KPL’s chief executive Jack Oguda indicated the Nyayo National Stadium could be available for use in two months time. “Following intensive consultations between the KPL vice-chairman Erick Oloo, AFC Leopards chairman Dan Mule, Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier and the FKF president Nick Mwendwa, it has been unanimously decided that owing to the home team’s confirmation on being unable to provide adequate security, no chance can be taken at hosting the match at Afraha,” the KPL statement said. The postponement comes a week after Nation Sport exclusively revealed Leopards, who are the home team, stand to lose Sh3 million in revenue from this game if it was played outside the bigger venues. Gor Mahia and Leopards are currently ranked second and fourth on the SportPesa Premier League respectively after eight round of matches.   The match had been set for Afraha Stadium in Nakuru this Sunday.

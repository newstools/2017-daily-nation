Hi, I am in a two-year relationship with a woman whom I am forcing myself to love because I promised to marry her. How can I leave her without hurting her?  Hi, Although I appreciate your honesty in this matter, I am a bit puzzled by your confession. However, this seems to be the prevailing attitude among partners in most relationships. Somehow, it  reveals  the mindset many people have towards relationships. Why do you tell someone, “I love you?” In fact, why would you dare say, “I love you and would like to marry you one day?” I believe that, since what we say carries a lot of  weight, there is a need to involve some  of deep conviction, reflection and thorough consideration regarding  why we say what we say and the consequences. I sense that you are apprehensive about her feelings when you break the news. As much as that might be the case, I question your initial motives that got you  where you are. Will she feel you lied to her? Can you really be trusted with another relationship? I suggest that, as much as you should  be worried about how you end this relationship, you should be  more concerned about your future and what drives you to make the decisions you make.

Vet Lab Sports Club s Robinson Owiti fired his way to the top of the leader board at the tough par 73 Kitale Golf Club course at the close of the first round of the Trans Nzoia Open golf championship on Saturday.The off scratch Owiti, whose name had been left out of the draw, shot two over par 75 to lead club-mate Edwin Mudanyi and Royal Nairobi s Dennis Saikwa by two shots.Owiti carded 37 gross at the opening and 38 from the back nine, for an early lead before heading back to the course for the afternoon s second round.Mudanyi and Saikwa fired 77 to tie for the second place with Limuru s John Karichu just a shot behind where he led a group of four others on 78.Only 12 players managed to play below 80 in the opening round at the 6,869 yards long Kitale course, one of the most challenging courses in the country. The course is playing long because of the rains while the lines are not very good so you really have to be very careful with the kind of shot you take, but we will play it as it is, said Owiti, who made four birdies in the first round, two in each nine for his leading scores.Meanwhile, action has resumed at the once popular Makuyu Golf Club in Murang'a Country. The nine-hole Makuyu course, which was once the home of the Armed Forces Golf Association, will this morning host its first event after almost three years.The Sunday Carnival golf tournament has attracted a field of 68 players though more players may play through post entries. We decided to revive the club since many golfers who have been members of the club for many years, are more than willing to support said Michael Gitonyi, and official of the club and past Thika Sports Club captain. email print email print

Kenya Power on Thursday intercepted two conmen attempting to defraud members of the public by offering them non-existent jobs at its Stima Plaza offices. The two were arrested for impersonating Kenya Power officers, and demanding cash in exchange for employment at the State utility firm. “Upon questioning, it was established that eight people were outside waiting to be facilitated by the duo into the building for “interviews” on a range of job vacancies,” read a statement by Kenya Power. The unsuspecting job seekers were to part with Sh5,000 each once issued with “employment letters”. The suspects were booked at Muthaiga Police Station. This incident comes barely a week after six people including employees of the power distributor were arrested for several offences including illegal connections. Two weeks ago a university student was arrested for selling to the public fake pre-paid power tokens. This week’s incident comes a year after a man in Nyeri was arrested for offering false employment letters. “The company notes that there are criminals out there duping members of the public that they are Kenya Power officials and that they will aid their electricity connection and secure employment for the victims. We will continue carrying out operations to stamp out these offenders,” said Kenya Power’s security services manager Geoffrey Kigen.

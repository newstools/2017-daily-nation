World Cross Country Championships mixed relays gold medallist Beatrice Chepkoech cashed in on the absence of several stars to win women s 3,000 metres steeplechase title Wednesday at the Kenya Police Service Athletics Championships at the Nyayo National Stadium.Fresh from posting personal best in a second place of nine minutes and 01.57 seconds at Doha s Diamond League meeting, Chepkoech obliterated the field of five athletes in a gun-to-tape performance victory of 9:50.06.Chepkoech, who finished fourth at the Rio Olympic Games, edged out Abigael Jelagat and Anne Gathoni to second and third places in 10:16.6 and 10:20.4 respectively. It was a good victory even though I am still on medication, having been admitted a while ago after I fell sick, said Chepkoech, who failed to compete in Shanghai last Sunday after she fell sick. I was admitted for three days after Doha but I am well now. Chepkoech, who will be seeking a double in women s 1,500m final Thursday, said she hopes to be fit for the Prefontaine Classic on May 27 in Eugene, USA, where she hopes to turn the tables on world champion Hyvin Kiyeng and Olympic champion Ruth Jebet from Bahrain.Chepkoech lost the Doha battle to Kiyeng, who ran a world lead time of 9:00.12, as Jebet, who is also the world record holder, came third in 9:01.99. But Kiyeng, who is also an Olympic silver medallist, lost to Jebet in Shanghai, clocking 9:06.72 against Jebet s winning time of 9:04.78.

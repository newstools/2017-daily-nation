Scandal , the popular American TV drama series that has attracted a large fan base in the country, hasn't been cancelled but will end with Season seven, according to TVLine. Entertainment gossip website TMZ had reported that the series had been terminated. But according to TVLine, which spoke to multiple sources at the ABC network that produces the series, Season 7 will be the last of the political drama. The network is expected to announce the end of the series next week on Tuesday when its executives meet advertisers and the media to unveil shows for the new season. The long-running series produced by Shonda Rhimes celebrated its 100th episode just weeks ago, where the cast and crew praised one another for reaching the incredible milestone. According to NPR Online Magazine, Rhimes made the call to conclude the series that premiered on April 2012, and ABC accepted her decision. She has previously said that the drama s heavily serialised, high-stakes narrative, necessitates a short shelf life and it seems she ll get no argument from viewers. I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told, Rhimes previously told NPR. So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is. And I don t think I m going to change that. This heart-breaking news to many fans who sit all day glued to their seats, comes with three episodes remaining in Scandal s current sixth season. email print email print Entertainment gossip website TMZ had reported that the series had been terminated.

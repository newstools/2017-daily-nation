Newly promoted Tanzania’s Vodacom Premier League side Singida United is on the verge of completing a transfer swoop for Tusker’s Ugandan left-back Shafik Batambuze. Singida - who earned a ticket to the top flight at the close of the 2016/17 Tanzanian second tier, have already engaged the Kenyan champions pertaining the former Sofapaka and Western Stima defender. “We are in talks and once we agree we shall let the player leave with 18 months on his contract. It’s our policy that we can’t stop any player from pursuing greener pastures,” Tusker CEO Charles Obiny told Nation Sport. The Ugandan international player, who featured in the team’s 28 league matches last season scoring a total three goals, was coy on the link. “What I know is that I am still a Tusker player but there has been interest from across the continent since last season. Normally, when you get good terms you can’t just let the chance go. We shall know what happens when the next transfer window opens,” the 23-year-old said. Reports privy to Nation Sport reveal the player signed a two year pre-contract with the club on Tuesday in Nairobi and is expected to earn a Sh250,000 monthly salary and a sign on fee of around Sh4 million. While in Tanzania, he will be offered accommodation and a car. Singida, coached by former Yanga tactician Dutchman Hans Van der Pluijm, have already kick started plans for the 2017/18 season. “I can’t comment about any player before I have my selection completed,” Pluijm told Nation Sport when asked about the reports on Batambuze. The club is owned by popular Tanzanian politician Mwigulu Nchemba.

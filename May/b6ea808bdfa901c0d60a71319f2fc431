Tapio Laukkanen continued with his winning ways by securing his second consecutive victory of the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship by winning the Eldoret Rally on Saturday.The Finn, who is the defending Kenya National Rally Drivers Champion, set fastest stage times in all but one of the seven competitive sections of the third round of the Western Kenya Motor Club-organised event at the wheels of his Subaru Impreza. Things worked out right for us right from the official reconnaissance of the route to the actual competition. The car also behaved well on stages, which were twisty and fast, Laukkanen said. Gavin Laurence, who took over the navigator s seat at the beginning of the season, said he was surprised by the Finn s driving. It is a great feeling to not only win but also keep up with the pace of one of the quickest drivers I have ever navigated. Yes it s great feeling and real good satisfaction, said Laurence.Despite setting a fastest stage time, Jassi Chatthe s Mitsubishi Lancer couldn t keep up with Laukkanen s Subaru Impreza. The former African champion was second overall out of the 19 finishers. Former Safari Rally winner, Baldev Chagger (Mitsubishi Evo 10) was placed third followed by Carl Tundo at the wheels of Mitsubishi Lancer. Mombasa Rally winner Manvir Baryan s Skoda returned in fifth place.Despite suffering a puncture and losing time, Ian Duncan was ninth in his familiar Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 10 car. Osman Abdullahi s performance was affected badly after his Subaru Impreza suffered two punctures and a damaged drive shaft in a single stage. More time was wasted after the jack failed to operate. He eventually finished in the last position.The two-wheel drive category was won by Leonardo Varese with his 15th position in a Toyota Levine.Natasha Tundo and Chantal Young, the sole lady crew in the event, finished in the 14th position.PROVISIONAL RESULTS1.

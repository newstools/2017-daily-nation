Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has called on politicians to embrace political tolerance to prevent the country from plunging into violence. To make peaceful elections in August possible, Archbishop Sapit urged losers to accept defeat. "Let us exercise our freedom by accepting when we are defeated rather than rejecting. "If the people say this is their will, please let us humbly accept that," he said. ON YOUR OWN He added that the tension between those vying as independents and those affiliated to political parties should be a cause for concern. Independents are facing firm objection from major outfits such as Nasa and Jubilee Party. For instance, Mr Odinga said independents should not ride on the coalition's influence in seeking victory. "Independents need to campaign for themselves. We have never said anywhere that we will campaign for them," Mr Odinga said during a church service at ACK St Stephenâ€™s Cathedral in Kisumu on May 21. INTEGRITY LEADERSHIP Speaking during the retirement service of Bishop Allan Waithaka at St James ACK Cathedral in Murang'a town, Archbishop Sapit urged leaders to be responsible and genuine in the quest to occupy political seats. "Some politicians are driven by greed for power and fame. Leadership is a calling and we must be honest when we are seeking positions," he said. He further warned politicians against zoning regions as their strongholds insisting it is creating unhealthy competition. "A member of any tribe can be the President of this country," he said.

Mr Gitura is defending his seat as an independent candidate after losing in the Jubilee nomination. "We must give each other respect regardless of party affiliation. We are all pursuing our constitutional right," he said.

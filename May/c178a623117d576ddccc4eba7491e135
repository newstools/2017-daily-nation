The fourth Athletics Kenya (AK) Track and Field meeting that was due to start Friday at Afraha Stadium, Nakuru has now been moved to Nyahururu. AK public relations officer Evans Bosire said the organisers have been forced to make the move after the ongoing rains left the track at Afraha waterlogged. Bosire said the grounds in Nyahururu are in a good state and ready to host the two-day championship despite the rains pounding the region. The Nakuru leg had initially been postponed owing to the pending AK elections but the High Court has since stopped the process and the athletics body said the competition will go on. “We thought it was wise to hold competition elsewhere since most athletes are ready. We really apologise for the inconveniences caused,” said Bosire. The AK Series have already been held in Bondo, Mumias and Thika. The series have drawn some of Kenya’s elite athletes the likes of 2013 World 800m champion Eunice Sum, who won women’s 1,500m in Mumias, while World Cross Country silver medallist Lilian Kasait claimed victory in the 3,000m race.   The country was barred from last year's Rio Olympics.

A woman has told a court that she did not travel to Nairobi with a 77-year-old Dutchman whose body was found in a septic tank six months after he went missing. Ms Elizabeth Wahinya said she had visited Mr Jagobous Van Der Goes on December 30, 2015, in Mombasa from Nairobi and stayed in his house. Ms Wahinya, an employee of a public relations firm in Nairobi, told Justice Asenath Ongeri that she left Mombasa on January 3, 2016 at 9.30pm. She further told the court that on the day she was leaving Mombasa for Nairobi, Mr Van Der Goes escorted her to a bus booking office where he bid her goodbye. EARLY DINNER “I hugged him and he wished me a safe journey,” said Ms Wahinya, adding that prior to being escorted they had an early dinner. The witness, who was being led in her evidence in chief by prosecution counsel Ngina Mutua said she did not talk to Mr Van Der Goes until she arrived in Nairobi, when he called and inquired if she had arrived safely. READ: Dutchman’s body found dumped in septic tank Ms Wahinya, who was testifying in a case in which John Ochieng Ayieko, his friend Joseph Ogola Ajowi and nephew Stephen Okoth Oboo have been charged with the murder of Mr Van Der Goes, said she last talked to Mr Van Der Goes on the morning of January 4. SENT TEXT MESSAGE The witness said she later sent a text message but there was no response, prompting her to call him but his phone was switched off. She said they first met in Mombasa in 2010 at a club where he asked for a date and eventually they started meeting, mostly on weekends. He paid her rent. Ms Wahinya said Mr Van Der Goes invited her to Mombasa when she called to convey Christmas and New Year wishes during the December 2015 holidays. The case was adjourned to July 13.   The police found the decomposing body of the man who went missing in January.

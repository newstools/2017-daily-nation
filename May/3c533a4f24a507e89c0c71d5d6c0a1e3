Newly elected Kenya Private Sector Alliance (Kepsa) chairman Nicholas Nesbitt has urged the government to attract direct local investments through replicating incentives offered to foreigners. Speaking when he replaced Dennis Awori whose two-year term ended last Friday, Mr Nesbitt said Kenya could fast-track economic growth if it gave the same impetus to locally sourced investments like it does foreign direct investments. “Political stability is key to the transformative agenda of ensuring competitiveness of the country as a business and investment destination,” he added. Kepsa also ushered in General Motors East Africa managing director Rita Kavashe as the new vice chairperson with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s brother Muhoho Kenyatta, who heads the family’s Brookside Dairy Ltd, joining the board of directors. Others elected to the board include Mr Awori as an ex-officio representing the Kepsa Foundation and Kenya Tourism Federation chairlady Lucy Karume.

Institutions of higher learning have been challenged to conduct research and offer practical solutions to societal challenges. Addressing Makerere University Business School graduates in Kampala, Uganda during the 12th  graduation ceremony yesterday, Mount Kenya University founder Simon Gicharu said universities will only be relevant when they solve problems. “The current problem in Kenya is food insecurity. The shortage of maize, the staple food, and other essential foodstuff such as milk and sugar, has been simplistically attributed to prolonged drought. However, a closer scrutiny will reveal a more serious problem of climate change,” said Dr Gicharu. He observed that the focus should be on how universities can be harnessed to churn out solutions to myriad challenges and hence promote the public good.

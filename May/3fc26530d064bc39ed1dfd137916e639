EACC detectives on Friday night raided the home of Nandi Chief Officer of Transport and Infrastructure Alex Buigut and recovered Sh5.7 million in cash. Mr Buigut is facing corruption charges, according to the agency. “The investigations commenced last year following several complaints made by contractors and members of public that there were no projects going on,” Mr Enoch Otiko, the EACC deputy director in charge of North Rift said. Dozens of tender documents relating to 120 road projects were also found in his house in Langas estate, Eldoret during the raid. “Generally, it has been a challenge in accessing the documents regarding projects in that county government . . . this is a private residence used to hoard the documents but we got a search warrant,” said Mr Otiko. He added that they would be studying the documents before giving a detailed report on the incident.   “Since we have recovered a lot of documents it will take time to analyse them and to be able develop a detailed inventory of what was recovered.  . . The apartment was operating like an office,” said the EACC official. Earlier, there was drama at the Eldoret’s EACC office after the official entered one of the rooms and threw an empty bottle at journalists who were following him. The county government has come under sharp criticism over public funds mismanagement allegations. County Senator Stephen Sang, who won the Jubilee ticket to contest for the gubernatorial seat in August, has in the past hit out at the current county government over claims of misuse of public resources and nepotism in employment. Mr Otiko said that they are investigating similar cases in all the six counties in the North Rift region.

Tharaka-Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa has accused the electoral agency of laxity, saying it has not taken action against candidates who have started campaigning ahead of the May 28 official date. He said he was not worried about his rivals’ early campaigns but said the law ought to be followed. “I am not worried about my rivals who are already in full campaign, but [the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission] should have implemented the regulation because some of us are still in office,” said Mr Ragwa. He was speaking during a funeral ceremony in Kianthumbi village in Tharaka South Sub-County on Monday. The governor announced that he will officially launch his campaign next week and was assured of trouncing his main rival, Chuka/Igambang’ombe MP Muthomi Njuki, in the August 8 elections. He also accused his rivals of spreading propaganda that Narc Kenya, on whose ticket he is seeking re-election, supports the National Super Alliance, whose flag-bearer is Raila Odinga. Mr Ragwa maintained that Narc Kenya endorsed President Uhuru Kenyatta for re-election at its national delegates conference. He called on residents to support him for a second term, promising to continue developing the county.

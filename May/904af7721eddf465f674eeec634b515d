Former AFC Leopards coach Ivan Minnaert has sued the club to Fifa’s Dispute Resolution Chamber over unpaid dues. The Belgian tactician is owed salary arrears amounting to $22,000 (approximately Sh2.2 million) for unlawful termination of his contract in September last year. The news of the suit came late Friday evening, just two days before Leopards confront their eternal rivals Gor Mahia in the SportPesa Premier League (SPL). Minnaert, currently handling Rwandan Premier League side Mukura VS, filed a suit at Fifa’s Department of Players Status and Governance against Leopards’ National Executive Committee led by chairman Dan Mule on Thursday. He also asked the Dispute Resolution Chamber led by Chairman Thompson Geoff and his deputy Grimm Thomas take measures against AFC Leopards to grant the correct payment and penalties for delaying payments. Ingwe had on January 10 this committed to clear the debt in six monthly installments as from January 25 until July 4, but to date, only Sh500 000 has been paid to the coach. Minnaert sought justice at the local football governing body, Football Kenya Federation (FKF), in early April but all he could get was a status report letter signed by CEO Robert Muthomi on April 6 requesting Leopards to pay the outstanding dues. “Football Kenya Federation is requesting for a status report on the commitment made in January 10th 2017 to pay the above named former AFC Leopards coach his outstanding dues in installments starting from February 25th 2017 to July 4th 2017. We look forward to your quick response,” read part of the letter.

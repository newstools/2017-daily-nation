Renowned Bongo Flava musician and member of the popular group TMK Family, Chege Chigunda has had it with people killing him on the internet. Online reports have it that the Kaunyaka musician was killed in a grisly road accident.He consequently took to Instagram to express his sentiments on the issue. I ve already explained that this picture was taken a long time ago from a movie scene, more than four years ago. God is watching and he will repay all the evil doers on earth. I have not been involved in any accident, don t you know how to read, or can t you look at the photo? I have changed my hair since then so how come I m in an accident with the same hair? Chigunda then urged social media users to use their platforms responsibly and assured his fans that he is okay. email print email print

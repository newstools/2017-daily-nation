MANCHESTER Manchester United cancelled their pre-match press conference in Stockholm on Tuesday ahead of the Europa League final after a bomb attack in Manchester killed 22 people, including children. "Due to the tragic events in Manchester last night and the effect that this has had on everyone here at our club and within our city, we have decided to cancel this evening's pre-match press conference in Stockholm," United said in a statement, on the eve of the final.

The shameless violence against match officials during a Football Kenya Federation (FKF) National Super League match in Mumias on Saturday must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. The referee and another were attacked by the losing team, which felt that the winning goal was not genuine. We have many times called for peaceful resolutions to conflicts in football and other sports, where the right channels must be followed when people feel aggrieved by decisions against them. Teams, and particularly, coaches must uphold discipline even if the results do not go their way. Hooliganism in sports must be eradicated at all costs. In contrast, Nairobi yesterday witnessed arch-rivals Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards in a peaceful derby despite an emphatic victory by the former. In the past, the hotly contested matches between the two have been marred by ugly incidents. We urge the fans of the two most popular teams in the country and other clubs to continue upholding discipline during their matches. FKF, the Kenya Premier League (KPL) and clubs must join forces to stamp out hooliganism, while referees must also do their best as arbiters. Referees play a crucial role in any game, hence the need for fairness to be done and seen to be done at all times. Football authorities must promptly and sternly discipline errant players and officials.

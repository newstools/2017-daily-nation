Hello,I have been dating my girlfriend for over three years now and recently, we moved in together. Everything in our relationship is perfect, I would say, except that she can't cook! Something happens when she touches food...it just loses its flavor! Her cooking is so bad that I am even afraid of inviting guests to our house for fear of judgment. I have even started wondering how our married life will be like. Please note that I have offered to cook before but she keeps telling me that it's her job. How do I gently tell her she is the worst cook I have ever met without hurting her feelings? I know women can be very sensitive about such stuff. Congratulations for realising that cooking is not a woman s job, for offering to step up and help.The bad news is that there is no easy way to tell her that her culinary skills do not cut it. The good news is that cooking is a skill that can be acquired. And it is possible to get her to improve without making her feel as if she is being attacked. Try taking cooking classes together. Make it fun. Kill two birds with one stone.And stop worrying too much about what others think of you or your relationship. You seem like you are in a relationship with a good woman. What others think of her should be their burden, not yours. email print email print I know people say you should never date a colleague but I had been on a dry spell and I thought why not?

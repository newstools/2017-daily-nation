Olympic 5,000m silver medallist Hellen Obiri has thrown down the gauntlet ahead of her title defence at the Kenya Defence Forces Athletics Championships that start on Tuesday at the Nyayo National Stadium.Obiri staged a remarkable return from maternity leave last year to win the 5,000m in 15 minutes and 21.8 seconds, beating Joycline Jepkosgei to second place in 15:40.1. Africa Cross silver medallist Sheila Chepkirui came third in 15:42.4. Obiri went on the win silver at the in Olympics before winning the KDF Cross Country Championships in January this year.

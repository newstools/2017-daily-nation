The MCAs chased out workers including clerks and accountants and locked doors of the headquarters. Kotaruk Ward Representative David Ateyo said budget and appropriation report is yet to be presented before the assembly yet only two weeks remain before the assembly is dismissed. He feared there may be no budget for the county in the next financial year. Mike Ewoi, Lpur ward representative, claimedÂ  funds two financial years are unaccounted for.

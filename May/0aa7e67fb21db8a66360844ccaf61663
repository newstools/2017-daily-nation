President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto have arrived at Mkunguni Square in Lamu where they are to address a political rally as they start their four-day tour of six Coast counties. The Jubilee leaders will later fly to Hola in Tana River County for another rally as the battle for the 1.7 million votes in the Coast heightens. The Nasa team is also expected to tour the area from June 8. The President is expected to launch the new renal, accident and emergence units, ICU and a new modern theatre at the Lamu King Fahad County Hospital that was built through a Sh100 million donation from the national government. The national government also donated another Sh100 million for the upgrading of two sub-county hospitals of Mpeketoni in Lamu West and Faza in Lamu East. Each hospital was granted Sh50 million. HOLA RALLY A communication from State has confirmed the President’s tour and said he will then head to Tana River County where he will address a rally at Hola Stadium. “Yes. The President is coming to the county and we are ready to receive him,” said Lamu County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri. The President’s tour also comes just months to the August 8 elections and the Head of State is also expected to drum up support for the Jubilee Party. Lamu residents who were interviewed by Nation in Lamu Town said they expect the President to give a pointer on when the subsidised maize flour will reach them. “Since they announced that maize had come from Mexico and flour was down to Sh90, we are yet to see it on our shelves here in Lamu. “We still buy at Sh120 per 2kg packet. We believe the President’s tour in Lamu today will change this and enable the Sh90 flour to finally reach Lamu,” said Mrs Mwanaisha Kombo. The last time the President and his Deputy visited Lamu was on March 9 when they commissioned the tarmacking of the 135-kilometre Garsen-Witu-Lamu road in Witu Town.

Chief Justice David Maraga on Thursday stormed two High Court registries to find out why case files go missing. He made impromptu visits to the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi in the late afternoon. “I have been receiving letters of complaints every day from members of the public about their lost files,” he said. Most complainants allege that files leave the registries but never reach the courts where relevant cases are scheduled, he said, and pointed out that civil and family cases were the most affected. He demanded to know from officers at the registries why files disappear and yet “their movement are clearly shown in the registers and delivery books”. Justice Maraga warned that those found culpable would be disciplined. He demanded that a detailed, thorough report on the matter be sent to him by the deputy registrars and executive officer. He asked an officer he met at the civil-case registry: “If you were the CJ and every day you receive many complaints, what would you do?” The officer was lost for words and only mumbled that those “were not good reports”. Many litigants have complained in recent times that files on their cases had disappeared and delayed proceedings. Judges have also complained about missing case files.

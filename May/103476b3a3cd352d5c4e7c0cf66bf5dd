Yet again, extra-judicial killings in Nairobi’s Eastlands and the runaway levels of crime there are hitting the headlines. This time, the focus is on an online character suspected to be a police officer using the name “Hessy” and who has caused a stir with his methods. The character warns suspected criminals on social media about their activities and asks them to quit before they encounter the police. He has earned a large online following by documenting the killing of these young suspects. It goes without saying that what is happening here is a horrifying example of the breakdown of law and order that has long been a feature of low-income estates in Nairobi. The answer cannot be for the police if — as is widely assumed due to the detailed online posts — it is they behind these killings, to take the law in their own hands and play the role of judge, jury and executioner. VIOLENT CRIME The government needs to pay deeper attention to this problem. Why are so many young city dwellers in Nairobi and Mombasa turning to violent crime? What can be done to offer a reliable income to school leavers in low-income settlements to give them an alternative to crime? If urgent attention is not paid to this crisis of lawlessness and hopelessness, many of these areas will soon turn into the ungovernable zones often witnessed in much of Latin America. It may be popular in the short term, but the shooting to death of suspected criminals will never address the deeper problems.

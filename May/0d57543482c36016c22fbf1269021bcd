Managing public secondary schools has become one of the toughest jobs in the country today. The head teachers are in a perpetual struggle that could drive even the best-trained managers pretty mad. Of course, it has everything to do with finances. In an effort to make secondary school education affordable to the majority of poor Kenyans, the Ministry of Education has set stringent fees guidelines. Whereas we all appreciate the need for these fee ceilings, it has become quite evident that the figures set by the ministry are unrealistic and impracticable. And even the ministry acknowledges as much, as the head teachers are free to ask the government for permission to slightly adjust the fees. However, this does not seem to be working. PERPETUALLY LATE Many who have sent such proposals to the ministry say there has been no feedback. And worse, even the government allocations to subsidise education are always perpetually late. Indeed, the situation is akin to asking the head teachers to become magicians and do some abracadabra and their financial problems vanish. But it is not possible and we are staring at a monumental crisis. It’s even worse with the escalating prices of food and amenities such as water and electricity. In some schools, parents would wish to pay more, but, of course, their hands and tied, too. The principals’ cry for more cash is genuine.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged losers in the Jubilee Party primaries to accept the decision of voters, saying it confirms the kind of democratic landscape existing in the country. President Kenyatta said Kenya will be a success as long as the will of the electorates prevail, because power belongs to the people. "Why are people blaming me when the voters made their decision and chose the leaders they want at the nominations. "Let us accept the decision of the electorates. To me, it is an indication of the level of the entrenchment of democracy in our country; and that the citizens are enlightened and know that power belongs to them not to the leaders." INCLUSIVITY Mr Kenyatta spoke today at State House, Nairobi, when he met members of the Nomiya Faith Churches from Nyanza, who were led by their Supreme Archbishop Caleb Olali. Political primaries have conducted nominations the whole of last month. President Kenyatta said he targeted delivering inclusive economic growth, because it is the kind of progress that will promote peace and prosperity. Moreover, he asked the church to preach peace and unity as the country readies for the August 8 elections. "I ask religious leaders to help us in preaching peace and uniting the country. Let us be agents of peace, unity and acceptance." KENYA'S DEVELOPMENT The members of Nomiya Faith Churches assured Mr Kenyatta of their support, saying his leadership has proved its capability in terms of development in the Nyanza region and beyond. They also encouraged him to visit their congregation next time he is in the area. "We are praying for you and for continuity as well as peace during the electioneering period," Archbishop Olali said.

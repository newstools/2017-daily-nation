Interior cabinet secretary Joseph Nkaissery has instructed police officers to arrest politicians who violate electoral laws "on spot" without seeking permission from higher authority. "We are going to war whether you are a politician or a citizen. If you engage in hate speech or incitement you will be arrested there and then. Officers will not wait for orders from above," he said. The CS was addressing police commanders from across the country at Safari Park hotel in Nairobi on Wednesday. Maj Gen (rtd) Nkaissery further directed that the law should enforced across the political divide without "fear or favour." The commanders are meeting to draw a common plan to ensure peace is maintained before, during and after the August 8 general election, ahead of the official campaign period that kicks off on Sunday. They also looked into lessons learnt during the ended party primaries. Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet assured the nation that his officers are ready for any eventualities during the electioneering period.

A section of the new standard gauge railway has been damaged at Mariakani However, Kenya Railways Managing Director Atanas Maina termed the damage to the guard rail as “nothing major” even though he could not specify the extent of the damage. The vandalised section is at Kibanda Hasara, Kwale County. At least eight metal bars were removed in the Friday incident. "Police are investigating what happened but we view this as a malicious act," Mr Maina said.   President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to launch the railway on Wednesday. Mr Maina said it's early to conclude whether the damage was intended to sabotage the commissioning. "We are waiting for investigations to be completed to make a conclusion," he said.

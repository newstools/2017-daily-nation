Nanyuki-based sprinter Maurice Wasike set a new national record in men’s 100 metres on Thursday as the curtain came down on Kenya Defence Forces Athletics Championships at Nyayo National Stadium. At the same time, Marsabit-based 10,000 metres runner Joyciline Jepkosgei led big names in winning their races at the championship. Wasike clocked 9.9 seconds to erase Mike Mokamba’s record of 10.23 seconds set in July 2015 at Kasarani Stadium. Wasike also met the qualifying time for World Championships of 10.12 seconds. Jepkosgei continued her record-breaking performance this year after she bagged the 10,000m title in 32 minutes, 26.3 seconds in the process erasing the previous KDF record of 32:51.26 held by J Ngotho since 1990.

She also set a new course record at the Gifu Seiryu Half Marathon in Japan. “It was a tough race. I thank God I came out on top.

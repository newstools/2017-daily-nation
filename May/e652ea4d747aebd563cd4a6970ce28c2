Nothing brings out the stark inequalities in our country more than the juxtaposition of mushrooming slums and residential property developments for the middle and upper classes. In one section of the towns, including the capital, there is squalor and unimaginable dearth of amenities, while in the other are developments comparable to the best anywhere else in the world. A plan by the Infrastructure ministry to address the rising migration to towns that has led to the massive growth of slums is a good idea. Indeed, the high numbers of people flocking to Nairobi and other towns in search of greener pastures only find themselves in congested uninhabitable dwellings. The slums do not only lack reliable water supply, the dwellers also have to contend with many other challenges, including lack of toilets, inadequate health care, poor roads and heaps of rotting garbage. In fact, these are veritable death traps. The ministry says there is a shortfall of 200,000 housing units annually. It is, therefore, partnering with donors to put up more. This is neither new nor revolutionary. The solution is to stem the flow of people into towns. For as long as the dream of a better life in towns is fuelled by abject poverty in the rural areas, the influx will continue. The solution lies in enhancing devolution to boost agriculture and other rural enterprises.

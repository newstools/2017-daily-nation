Four Baringo Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) have been questioned over the killing of their colleague last week. The ward representatives, however, said the police wanted to know if Churo/Amaya Ward MCA Thomas Minito had expressed fear for his life before he was abducted and killed. The MCA went missing last Tuesday and his body was found four days later in Donyo Sabuk, Machakos County. Police said the body which was found floating in Athi River by a boda boda operator had an injury on the head inflicted by a blunt object. Mr Minito was reportedly approached by three people at a hotel in Kabarnet town on Tuesday afternoon when he was taking lunch with a county official from Tiaty. Those grilled by the detectives from Nairobi are Isaiah Bowen (Marigat), Johanna Chebon (Kabarnet) Douglas Kiplimo (Eldama-Ravine) and Cynthia Jerotich (nominated). The four were questioned one after another on Wednesday inside one of the offices in the county assembly from 10am until evening. Mr Kiplimo said the officers did not tell them they were suspects but that they wanted information from those said to have been friends of the slain MCA. "The detectives have not come to incriminate anyone but they are questioning friends of the deceased MCA. â€œThey are asking if he ever mentioned to anybody if he had ever received any death threats. They said they did not have any police records of him indicating threats to his life that is why they are talking to friends to know if he ever told them anything," said Mr Kiplimo. He said that the detectives promised them that they were working hard to ensure those behind the murder were apprehended soon.

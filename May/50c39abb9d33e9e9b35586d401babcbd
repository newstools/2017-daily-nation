A repeat of Wiper Party gubernatorial nominations in Machakos County has began in some polling station. The party’s national elections board announced Friday evening that the exercise will begin Saturday after the Political Parties Tribunal sitting in Nairobi nullified Ms Wavinya Ndeti’s nomination. There was a delay in delivery of ballot materials with Ms Agatha Solitei, the Wiper National Election Board chairperson blaming one of the aspirants for the late start. She alleged that Mr Bernard Kiala raided the elections board operation centre at Gracia House in Nairobi with armed people Friday night disrupting distribution of election materials. She said police had to intervene to restore order. Mr Kiala has however denied that he caused any disruption at the election board offices. On Friday, Mr Kalonzo Musyoka, the Wiper Party leader, who attended the news conference dismissed the Tribunal's observations that the Machakos nominations were marred with irregularities. He claimed the findings were a ploy to deny his party the gubernatorial seat. “We are smelling a rat. This is a trick to deny Wiper Party a gubernatorial seat in Machakos,” Mr Musyoka said. He added that the tribunal should be reconstituted to include members of political parties. Ms Ndeti is contesting against Machakos Deputy Governor Bernard Kiala for the party’s ticket.   High Court and Political Parties Dispute Tribunal order conducting of repeat elections.

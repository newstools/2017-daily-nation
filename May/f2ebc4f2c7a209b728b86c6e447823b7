Confusion has marred a repeat of the ODM primary elections at seven polling stations in Suba South constituency in Homa Bay County that were scheduled for Wednesday morning. Some of the centres that are to be used as polling stations are in primary schools and pupils are already in class. In other polling stations, voting had not begun by 7am. The confusion has further been deepened by the refusal of aspirant Caroli Omondi to participate in the polling, after he claimed that the party is favouring incumbent MP John Mbadi for the ticket. Mr Omondi said he will not participate in a primary election that his competitor, who is the party's national chairman, had single-handedly organised. MOCKERY OF DEMOCRACY "It is a mockery of democracy when I participate in an exercise whose results are predetermined,‚Äù said Mr Omondi. He said he would issue a comprehensive statement on his next course later Wednesday. The elections have been scheduled for the Koga, Miria God Oloo, Oma, Kiembe, Mukuyu and Nyakiya polling centres. Mr Mbadi has said he is ready for them and expressed confidence he will win.

If statistics are anything to go by, then Gor Mahia will start slightly as favourites against bitter rivals AFC Leopards in Mashemeji derby on Sunday. Gor Mahia boast four of victories in their last six away matches against Leopards. They thumped Leopards 2-0 the last time out on October 23 last year. In the current season, 15-time champions Gor Mahia have bagged three victories from their last four matches away. They swept aside Kariobangi Sharks 3-1 and then overpowered SoNy Sugar and Bandari by identical 2-1 margins. Coach Marcelo Ferreira’s men will therefore fancy their chances against a Leopards’ side, which has been winless in two matches. Stewart Hall-coached Leopards came from behind to draw 1-1 with leaders Posta Rangers on April 29 just days after losing 1-0 at home against Sofapaka. From the statistics and considering that Leopards and Gor have each conceded six goals in eight matches, fans should also expect goals in this match. Some of the key players to watch are striker Gilbert Fiamenyo and midfielder Whyvonne Isuza (Leopards) and Rwandans Meddie Kagere, Jean-Baptiste Mugiraneza and Jacques Tuyisenge and Kenya number one Boniface Oluoch (Gor). Ghanaian Fiamenyo tops the scoring charts after planting four goals in the league so far.   The game kicks off at 3pm.

Top performers from Kenya Open Bisley Shooting championships have now turned their focus on United Kingdom Bisley due June in London.General Service Unit s (GSU s) Sergeant Sanford Otundo (above) recaptured the Kenya Open title when he floored Chief Inspector John Ihugo from Kenya Police-Railways and fellow GSU Sergeant Grace Rantile at the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) Shooting Laikipia Range on Saturday.The 33-year-old reclaimed the crown he lost last year when he returned a final round of 136 points with eight vee-bulls (136/8) from long range for a total 281.24.It was Otundo s second Kenya Open victory, having won his maiden title in 2015 before losing the crown to John Serem from Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) last year.Otundo brought 73.6 from 800m and 63.2 at 900m while Ihugo returned 277.25 after he carded 131.9 made of 71.6 and 60.3. It was Ihugo s best finish having finished third in 2009.Fresh from winning Kenya Defence Forces Full-bore trophy two weeks ago, Rantille settled third with 273.20 after her final round 130.5 comprising 67.4 and 63.1 respectively. Rantille becomes the third woman to finish in top three at the Kenya Open Bisley after KDF s Nune Bonaya who finished second in 2015 and Farhiya Mohammed (KDF), who finished third in 2013. I had a problematic rifle last year but I fixed it, said Otundo, who is looking forward to the UK Bisley where he will be making his 17th appearance for Kenya. I might not be going to UK Bisley but I hope to make in next year, said Rantille, who was making her second Kenya Open after finishing 15th overall last year on debut. The climb is gradual and I hope to win next year. email print email print

Polycarp Igathe hates corruption and gossip. In a December 2013 interview, he lambasted Kenyans for the two vices. Asked what he regarded as their worst traits, the Vivo Energy managing director answered matter-of-factly: “Corruption and gossip. Oh, Kenyans are gossips.” It is an abhorrence that could come in handy as he embarks on ridding City Hall of graft should he become Nairobi County’s deputy governor in August. In his illustrious career, the University of Nairobi graduate has been the regional MD for East Africa at consumer goods manufacturer Haco Tiger Brands, where he worked for a decade. He previously was Kenya Association of Manufacturers chairman and a director at the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, the apex body for the private sector in Kenya. In his first job as a budget officer for the government of Queensland, Australia, in 1996, his salary was $750 (Sh75,000). After a year and a half, he returned to Kenya and worked at Coca-Cola until 2000, when he joined AfricaOnline as a sales and marketing manager. He then joined Kenya Breweries as a sales operations manager and later marketing manager. In February, Mr Igathe was involved in a gun drama with nominated Senator Paul Njoroge at Karai, on the Nairobi-Naivasha highway. Mr Njoroge fired in the air in a bid to stop the closure of his petrol station by workers led by Mr Igathe over a trade dispute.

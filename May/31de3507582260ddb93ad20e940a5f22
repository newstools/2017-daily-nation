Half of the national roller skating team that is due to leave the country on Friday for the Italy International Roller Road Race set for this weekend in L Aquila, is likely to be left behind owing to lack of funds.Kenya Federation of Roller Skating (KFRS) secretary general Lameck Wafula said that the country was to be represented by nine skaters and one official but only five skaters have received tickets from well-wishers.Wafula said they had requested for Sh1.2million sponsorship from the government to take care of air tickets and allowances but nothing has been forthcoming. We only needed air tickets and some allowances since the organisers have agreed to take care of accommodation and meals. They will need some money to move around and the organisers can t provide that, said Wafula.SCORE POINTSThe championship is part of the international series that are held with skaters getting points ahead of the World Championships later in the year. The points will place our skaters in the top groups, said Wafula.The team has skaters who have represented Kenya in several international events before including the 2013 World Championships held in Belgium and 2016 Berlin World Marathon.Erick Chaulin was among those who represented Kenya in Belgium while Simon Irungu and Peter Kamau competed in Berlin. Chaulin, Irungu, Kamau, Joseph Ndungu and Hillary Kinuthia have managed to get air tickets from a well-wisher. Those still seeking funds for air tickets are Isaac Mburu, Jane Njeri, Mango Otieno and Wafula, who is the team manager-cum-coach. We will be happy if the government will provide the tickets to those remaining in addition to some allowances since we just can t go to a foreign country without some money, said Wafula. email print email print

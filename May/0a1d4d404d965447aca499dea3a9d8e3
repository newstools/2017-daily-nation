The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) athletics championships enter the home stretch on Wednesday at Nyayo National Stadium, with Olympic 400m hurdles silver medallist Boniface Mucheru one of the star attractions.A day after Olympic 5,000m silver medallist Helen Obiri and little-known Peter Muindi bagged the 5,000m and 10,000m titles, respectively, Mucheru qualified for the final in style. It will be interesting to watch him, especially after his disastrous outing during the first round of the IAAF Diamond League in Qatar last Friday, where he finished second last in a time of 50.61 seconds. The hamstring injury I have on both legs affected me, but Kenyans should not worry about the time I posted in Doha. I m travelling to Finland for specialized treatment from May 14-19, Mucheru said after punching the ticket to final. On Tuesday, Obiri completed 5,000m in 15 minutes, 43.2 seconds, almost eight seconds ahead of her closest rival Veronica Wanjiru, while world half marathon record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei finished third. Meanwhile, seven-time African champion Grace Wanjiru exuded confidence of retaining her national title for the 17th year after winning the women s 20km walk race.The 37-year-old bagged the KDF crown in 1:34:15, shattering her previous armed forces record of 1:45:38 which she set on July 20, 2000.

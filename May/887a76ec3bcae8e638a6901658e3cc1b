Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua and the Kirinyaga Central MP Gachoki Gitari have declared that they are ready for the gubernatorial race and pledged to jointly slay the dragon of corruption if elected. Ms Karua, a fierce politician, is the flag-bearer while Mr Gitari, a two-term lawmaker, is her running mate. While announcing publicly that they have teamed up to capture the county's top seat, the two leaders vowed they will not tolerate graft in the devolved unit. "We shall ensure that corruption is eradicated in order to spur economic growth in the region," said Ms Karua. Mr Gitari praised Ms Karua as an honest leader who has been on the forefront in the fight against corruption in Kenya. WIN SUPPORT "Ms Karua is a courageous and honest leader and together we shall win the war against corruption," he said. The two leaders said they were united and challenged their rivals to brace themselves for a tough political battle. Speaking in Sagana town on Tuesday afternoon, the leaders said they will embark on aggressive door-to-door campaigns to win support. They will fight it out with former Devolution Cabinet secretary Anne Waiguru (Jubilee), Macharia Karani of Maendeleo Chap Chap, incumbent Joseph Ndathi and Muriithi Kagai. The last two are running as independent candidates. PROPAGANDA The two leaders hit out at Ms Waiguru, accusing her of misleading residents that she had been endorsed by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "There is a candidate who is going round the region telling residents that she is the president's preferred candidate. "The President has not endorsed anyone for the gubernatorial seat and she must be ignored," said Ms Karua in reference to Ms Waiguru. Ms Karua reiterated that her party had endorsed President Kenyattaâ€™s re-election but the Head of State himself had not endorsed any candidate for any political seat. "Anyone seeking to be elected as a governor must sweat," she said.

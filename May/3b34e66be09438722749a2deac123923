Police in Kwale County are hunting thieves who stole 95 computer tablets at Mwena Primary School. Lunga Lunga OCPD Charles Ouma confirmed that unknown people broke into the school on Sunday night and made away with the digital devices bought by the government under Digital Literacy Programme (DLP). Mr Ouma said 18 of the tablets were donated by an NGO from Netherlands to assist children in acquiring digital skills. GUARD QUESTIONED The burglars are said to have broken into the room where the tablets were being stored at around 2am. The security guard has been summoned for interrogation as investigations continue. "We suspect the watchman was either not on duty when the incident happened or he was hiding somewhere as it was raining heavily. "The guard claimed that he was attacked during the incident and the thugs had crude weapons but he sustained no injuries," Mr Ouma said. BOOST SAFETY The police boss urged residents with vital information regarding the theft to liaise with relevant authorities. The theft has raised concerns about the safety of the devices in schools. He advised school administrators to be more vigilant and curb security lapses that could lead to similar incidents in the future. The programme is part of the Jubilee government manifesto delivery and is being implemented in primary schools countrywide. The programme started in November last year.

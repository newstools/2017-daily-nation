The Lands ministry has suspended all compensation claims to enable it seal loopholes used by fraudsters to swindle beneficiaries. Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi noted that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) is currently conducting an audit of the ministry. Prof Kaimenyi, who was responding to claims of irregular compensation of those affected by the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway, told Kenyans to be patient until the anti-corruption agency completes its investigations.

He added that the ministry had prepared the Land Value Index Laws (Amendment), Bill that is currently before Senate. If passed, he said, the law would introduce different forms of compensation. HOUSES RAIDED These include allocation of alternative piece of land of equivalent value and comparable geographical location, equity shares in a government owned entity, and issuance of government bonds and grant or transfer of development right as may be prescribed. The EACC last week raided the homes of National Lands Commission officers following concerns over SGR land compensation.

An MP has called for amendments to the Constitution to do away with the provision for independent candidates in elections. Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi says the decision to allow aspirants who lose in party primaries to vie as independents is unfair. “It was a mistake created in the law. I propose that the Constitution be amended to do away with this loophole as the provision is making our politics turn chaotic,” he said. “I will personally sponsor this amendment after the August 8 general election so that this position is removed,” added Mr Agoi. The Constitution stipulates that a person is eligible to vie as an independent candidate if he or she is not a member of a registered political party and has not been a member for at least three months before the date of an election. HUGE NUMBER Some 4,000 aspirants have already been cleared by the Registrar of Political Parties to vie as independent candidates in the August 8 elections. Out of this number, 10 are seeking the presidency and 27 are vying for governorship. There are 31 independents vying for senator, 215 for MP seats, 14 for woman representative and many others for MCAs. The number of independents this year is Kenya’s biggest ever. Majority of the independents claim they were rigged out during the nominations and have vowed to be on the ballot to face off with their rivals who were handed certificates by their parties. Mr Agoi blamed the increase in the number of independents to the law that was passed to bar party hopping.

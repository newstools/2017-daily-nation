A Nairobi court has summoned North Mugirango MP Charles Mongare for allegedly reporting to the police that his daughter and her Muslim lover are members of a terrorist group. The MPâ€™s daughter, Erisiana Sambili Mongare, and her lover, Ahmed Salem, a pilot, appeared in court Friday to face charges of being members of a terrorist group. They were brought to court by Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers, who wanted the couple remanded pending investigations. But their lawyer Hassan Nandwa told the court that the two lovers were fixed by the MP because he is opposed to the relationship. Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku ordered the parents of the two suspects to appear in court on Monday to explain the issue raised by the lawyer.

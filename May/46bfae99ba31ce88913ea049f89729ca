Did you go to school to study the course? I got into fashion design for two reasons, to look good and because I have an OCD tendency to reject bad clothing. I did not go to school. I am a self-taught designer. When I started getting interested, I was dating a lady who was in a fashion school, so we basically did her homework together.  2. What makes a good suit? Mostly, the feeling of wearing the suit. Apart from that, the fitting.  3. How long have you been running your blog? What’s your most popular blog to date? It’s been about a year since I started blogging at www.rogergitau.wordpress.com. I think the most popular blog post is the last one I did.  The post was about the Moët & Chandon invite-only dinner at the Villa Rosa Kempinski. I have gained a following and now every blog post becomes bigger than the previous.  4. What do you think is the best way for people to start doing what you do? Can they make a living off it? To be consistently passionate about it to a point that even if it’s not working, you still push on. The fashion industry is a multi-billion dollar industry so it can pay well.  5. What else are you interested in, outside fashion? What do you do on weekends? I love real estate. It’s one thing that I will be doing in the long run.  I am more of a workaholic, so on weekends, you’ll almost certainly find me working.

He is not just a snake charmer, but is also a healer of sorts, as neighbours often call upon him to treat snake bites. This one is a green Mamba it is so poisonous that once bitten you need to see a doctor in 90 minutes. This is a Boom Slang, it is not as poisonous as the others. Next is the Puff adder next to it spitting cobra. If the spitting cobra s poison enters your eyes, you become blind, said Haji as he showed Daily Nation around the snake park."I hail from the community of snake charmers. Though it is not something everyone can do, I feel blessed to have excelled and mastered the art. I am proud of my talent.Snake charmer Haji Mwachambuli is pictured here with a python.

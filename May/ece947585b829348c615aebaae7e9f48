Mandera East MP Abdulaziz Farah has announced that he will not be seeking re-election in the August 8 elections, citing frustration from the negotiated democracy propagated by community elders.Mr Farah made public his withdrawal from the race in Mandera Town when he unveiled two school buses, a hearse, and four motorbikes for primary school headteachers, one Toyota Land Cruiser vehicle for security agencies and a pick-up truck, all purchased through Constituency Development Fund (CDF).The MP blamed elders for his current political downfall further saying the elders decisions only suppresses good leadership. I am not in the race for this parliamentary seat because of the effects of the negotiated democracy that caused a lot of mix-up and confusion, he said.POLITICAL MATHMr Farah admitted that his political mathematics did not add up in an attempt to convince the council of elders to allow him to seek re-election. The end results of negotiated democracy are not worthy investing in because almost every candidate feels short-changed by the elders, he said.The legislator cited clan interests as his main reason for quitting the race, arguing that he is interested in seeing a united community. I had to mind the community and avoid punching the decision makers so that my future can remain stable, he said.He is optimistic that the elders will consider him in future for his obedience.The MP said negotiated democracy is neither good nor bad for the community as it ensures equity but it still suppresses good leadership.Mr Faraha becomes a fourth political leader to accept the elders decree.BOWED OUTOthers who have bowed out as a result of elders decisions are Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow, Woman Rep Fathia Mahbub and Mandera South MP Mohamed Huka.Governor Ali Roba led another group of four legislators from the semi-arid county to defy the elders decree adopted in August 2016.Mr Roba and his team of Mr Mohamud Mohamed (Mandera West) Mr Issack Shabaan (Lafey) Mr Mohamed Abdow Haji (Banisa) Mr Adan Mohamed Noor (Mandera North) bagged Jubilee Party tickets as the elders team led by a former powerful provincial commissioner chickened out and formed the Economic Freedom Party (EFP). Negotiated democracy has advantages and disadvantages including equity where each clan gets its fair share and limits friction but it compromises the quality of leadership of a clan, observed Mr Farah.The MP denied allegations that his withdrawal is due to failure to secure a direct Jubilee ticket like other MPs in the county who defied the elders.Mandera East was the only constituency subjected to Jubilee Party nominations where Mr Farah lost to Mr Hussein Weytan. email print email print

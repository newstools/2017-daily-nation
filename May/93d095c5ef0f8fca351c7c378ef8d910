The body of a 23-year-old prison warder was found dumped by the roadside near King’ong’o Prison in Nyeri. Central region prisons commandant Hassan Bugu said the body had stab wounds in the chest, head, and neck. “There are no signs of struggle at the scene of crime. The prison constable must have been killed somewhere else and the body dumped near the correctional facility,” said Mr Bugu. He said the warder was posted to the institution last year. “Preliminary observations indicate that the body was dropped from a moving car because there are tyre marks just next to it. We are investigating the incident,” said Mr Bugu, who was accompanied by Patrick Araduh, the officer in charge of the prison. The officers did not reveal the name of the officer as his family had not been notified. The body was moved to the Nyeri Referral Hospital mortuary.

The government will take charge of school feeding programmes from January. Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said the government had increased budgetary allocation to the programme by Sh1.6 billion. “We want to tell the World Food Programme to go and feed others. We want to give meaning to independence,” said Dr Matiang’i while addressing an Africa Union and WFP continental consultation on homegrown school feeding in Nairobi.

OVER-RELYING ON DONORS Dr Matiang’i said the school feeding programme had helped keep children in school. “This improves not only enrolment and attendance, but all aspects of learning,” he said. He urged African governments to stop over-relying on donors. “Africa leaders should wake up from public relations language at AU summits. Five decades after gaining independence we cannot be discussing how our children are going to be fed by others,” he said.

Celebrated gospel musician Christina Shusho last week had a mini preaching session on her Instagram page and she opened up on a few things, among them women who wear pants to church. The Ninang’ara singer, in a series of short videos started off with a disclaimer stating that she did not want to spark arguments “with the church or God’s people.”“I have no problem with ladies wearing pants to church but I’m also not here to promote ladies wearing pants because that’s none of my business. I’m speaking on behalf of those who have come to me with the issue. As a Christian woman, dress decently, even if you’re wearing pants make sure you look respectable,” she said.Shusho however clarified that she does not consider wearing pants a sin.“Wearing pants isn’t a sin, there are a lot worse things in the world but I still maintain dress decently. When you look at the mirror ask yourself,  I’m I representing Christ the right way? And if you think you are then go for it,” she said.

Luo and Kalenjin elders on Friday performed rituals to symbolise their unity in a bid to push for Nasa leader Raila Odinga’s quest for the Presidency. The elders drawn from Nandi, Kipsigis, Keiyo and Talai in the Rift Valley joined their Luo counterparts at the home of Luo Council of Elders chairman Willis Opiyo Otondi in Nyahera, Kisumu County. The elders were first holed up in a meeting for seven hours before the ritual activities began. Nandi elders head of delegation Christopher Koiyoke said the ceremony marked a new walk of life between the Luo and the Kalenjin community. “We have buried the hatched and want to renew our working relationship with our Luo brothers as witnessed in the run up to the 2007 general elections,” Mr Koiyoke said. Keiyo South Constituency ODM nominee Micah Kigen, who was also part of the delegation said the ceremony marked a new beginning for a “better working relationship among the communities.” Mr Otondi said the elders unanimously agreed to throw their weight behind Mr Odinga in his quest for the Presidency. WESTERN ALLIANCE Luo Council of Elders Secretary Owino Nyady read the resolutions which included a proposal for the formation of a Western alliance to include Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley regions for the purpose of socio-political empowerment. “We also proposed formation of a National Council of Elders where we can share ideas,” Mr Nyady stated. Mr Koiyoke said the elders will on June 4 join the Nasa campaign in Kapsabet. “We will make a major declaration during the rally,” he said. Dorothy Awino who spoke on behalf of the women during the Friday meeting said they agreed to ensure peaceful coexistence with the neighbouring communities. “We have agreed to foster peace to ensure no more lives are lost during clashes in our borders as well as to end cross-border cattle rustling,” she said.

Narc Kenya party Leader Martha Karua has told the former devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru not to rejoice yet, warning of a tough battle on August 8 for the Kirinyaga governorship. Ms Waiguru is the Jubilee Party nominee for the seat after she garnered 100,632 votes beating her close rival, Kirinyaga Central MP Joseph Gitari Gachoka, who got 46,678 votes while the incumbent governor, Joseph Ndathi, got 17, 085 votes during the party’s primaries. Ms Karua who spoke on Saturday when her party endorsed the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, said from her past leadership legacy, she is confident that she will defeat Ms Waiguru and become the second Kirinyaga governor. “I am ready to take Kirinyaga governor’s seat, those who won during party nominations should not celebrate yet, I was not part of the nominations and if I were, I would still have emerged the winner,” said Ms Karua. “That was just a beginning, let them be ready for a friendly fire,” she said. The former presidential candidate said her campaigns will be issue-based and will not focus on propaganda. “We are not hate speech people, let’s have peaceful elections which will reflect us as peaceful leaders,” he told Narc Kenya delegates from across the country. The move by the party to support President Kenyatta is likely to boost her bid.

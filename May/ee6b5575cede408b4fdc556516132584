New teachers posted to schools in Basuba, Lamu East, have threatened to abandon duty citing insecurity. Five primary schools – Basuba, Mangai, Milimani, Mararani and Kiangwe – were closed in 2015 following increased attacks by al-Shabaab in the area. The schools were, however, reopened in January this year after the national government posted 10 new teachers to serve in the region. But speaking to journalists in Lamu on Tuesday, the teachers said they no longer felt safe in the area. RECEIVED THREATS Boni schools chairman Mohamed Loo, who is also Mangai Primary School headteacher, said they had received threats from suspected al-Shabaab militants and their sympathisers who are keen on blocking government support to the area. Mr Loo urged the Teachers’ Service Commission (TSC) to transfer them to other regions. Lamu County TSC director Charles Nyauma said he had received the transfer requests, adding that the commission was looking into the reports before any action can be taken. County Commissioner Joseph Kanyiri, however, dismissed the insecurity claim, saying the area is safe.

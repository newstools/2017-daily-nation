ROME MotoGP star Valentino Rossi has been discharged from hospital in Rimini where he was admitted after a training accident, Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Friday. The 38-year-old Italian suffered chest and stomach injuries in a motocross training accident at Mondavio in Pesaro Urbino near Rimini on Thursday and was taken to hospital. He spent the night and morning under observation and "was authorised to return home" late in the afternoon, Gazzetta added. Earlier Yahama confirmed that Rossi was making "positive progress" from chest and stomach injuries. "Having been diagnosed yesterday evening (Thursday) with mild thoracic and abdominal trauma, following a motocross accident....Valentino Rossi is making positive progress with his recovery," Yamaha announced. They said Rossi may be released from hospital later Friday depending on the results of further tests. Rossi crashed out of the French Grand Prix at Le Mans on the last lap last weekend handing victory to teammate Maverick Vinales and lies third in the world championship standings. It is not clear whether Rossi will be fit enough to take part in the Italian Grand Prix at Mugello next week.

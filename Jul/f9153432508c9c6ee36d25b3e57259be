Nine Russian athletes will compete at this month s IAAF World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi.However, the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), who approved their participation, clarified that the athletes will compete as neutral entrants and not fly the flag of their nation that remains banned from international competition for flouting anti-doping rules.The Doping Review Board, which is composed of Robert Hersh (chairman), Sylvia Barlag and Antti Pihlakoski, accepted the applications of the athletes for the world youth event. The IAAF Doping Review Board has agreed the applications of nine Russian athletes to compete in the IAAF U18 World Championships Nairobi 2017 as neutral athletes under Competition Rule 22.1A (b) while the Russian national federation (RusAF) remains suspended, said a statement from IAAF on Friday.However, the statement noted their participation as neutral athletes in Nairobi is still subject to formalities for eligibility under IAAF Rules being completed and subject to acceptance of their entries.Russia was suspended in November, 2015, for systematic doping but a total of 22 applications by athletes to compete as neutrals have been approved this year with 45 declined. I d like to thank the members of the Doping Review Board for their continued dedication and diligence in this ongoing review process, said IAAF President Sebastian Coe. Coe noted that this process was about their desire to support the hopes and aspirations of all clean athletes including Russian athletes of all ages who have been failed by their national system. I am delighted these nine athletes will get a chance to compete as neutral athletes in these championships and we will ensure they have the support network they require to compete to the best of their ability, said Coe. The athletes are Ekaterina Gorshenina, Salavat Ilkaev, Elvira Khasanova, Sergey Kozhevnikov (all race walkers), Polina Miller and Varvara Nasibulina (sprinters).Others are Danila Tundykov (middle distance), Valentina Ulyanova (high jump) and Aksana Gataullina (pole vault).Since publication of updated guidelines earlier this year, the IAAF has received more than 130 applications from Russian athletes, more than 40 of which have been endorsed by their national federation, RusAF. A number of these applications remain under review by the Doping Review Board in accordance with the guidelines. email print email print

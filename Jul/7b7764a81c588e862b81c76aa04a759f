A State official has downplayed the influence of corruption cartels in big ticket tender projects. Planning Principal Secretary (PS) Irungu Nyakera said the procurement law had sealed loopholes that rogue contractors and corrupt public officials exploited to inflate project costs. Mr Nyakera Friday said the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015, effected in January last year, had removed ambiguity in tendering. “The biggest issue we have had with corruption on infrastructure projects is perception. We no longer have projects costing Sh100 million being tendered at Sh300 million as corrupt officials can no longer award themselves contracts under the new law,” he said. While the repealed Act was silent on the value of the tender, the new law now specifies that the cost shall not exceed two per cent of the tender as valued by the procuring entity. Policy meeting Mr Nyakera, who spoke during a policy meeting organised by Strathmore Business School, also justified the huge government investments in infrastructure, saying it would boost economic growth by creating an enabling environment for private businesses to thrive. “Manufacturing is about transport, labour, power and raw materials. We can never be an effective manufacturing hub without infrastructure. That means then we have to improve our transport,” said Mr Nyakera. The PS added that devolution has also helped to fast-track construction of roads in the counties that now connect formerly remote areas to the major highways for easy transportation of agricultural produce to the markets at lower costs. On criticism that the government had spent a lot of taxpayers’ money on ill-thought out projects that were not viable, Mr Nyakera said the issue of infrastructure development had been politicised. “People don’t appreciate the importance of infrastructure until it has been done,” he said. “Mega projects are expensive but they have to be done.”

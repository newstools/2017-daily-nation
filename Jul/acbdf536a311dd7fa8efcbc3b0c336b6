Kenya's national rugby union team the Simbas take on Tunisia in an Africa Gold Cup rugby match this afternoon at the RFUEA Ground in Nairobi. The championship now has six teams from the previous four. The Simbas, who are the 2011 and 2013 champions, started their campaign with a draw against Uganda Cranes a fortnight ago in Nairobi. The contest also features defending champions Namibia, Zimbabwe and Senegal. The team that finishes last will be relegated next season. Next year’s competition will double as the 2019 World Cup qualifier. For this reason, Saturday’s match is crucial for the Simbas. The Simbas put up a spirited battle during the 2015 World Cup campaign and only missed qualifying for the World Cup by a point. The team had prepared well with good test matches. However, the current team is short on skills. Uganda exposed the Simbas’ inexperience. In the long-term, Kenya Rugby Union, clubs, sponsors and players must devise better strategies for enhancing the standards of the game. In this regard, the players and technical bench must be rewarded well and given proper training.

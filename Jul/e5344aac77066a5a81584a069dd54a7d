Hi Brenda,I am 24. There is this woman I have been dating for three years. I love her very much and she ticks off most of the qualities that I am looking for in a wife. The problem is that while I am a graduate, she did not go past high school. I want to be with her but her level of education is weighing me down. What should I do? Kindly advise. First of all, I hope you know that someone s level of education is not always a direct indication of their level of intelligence. Some people just never get the opportunities.Second, you need to decide whether her level of education is a deal breaker for you or if you are just worried about what people will think. If the latter is true, then you have no problem at all. Just continue loving your woman. If it truly is a deal breaker for you and this woman is as great as she is, I have some good news. Her level of education is something that can be changed. Motivate her to want to go further. Be the man that makes her a better woman.Got a problem you want to share?

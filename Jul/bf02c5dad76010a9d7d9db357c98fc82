Nairobi Senator Mike Mbuvi Sonko, who is vying for the city governorship, has been crowned as a Kamba elder in a colourful ceremony held Wednesday in his Mua Hills home in Machakos. In the ceremony, presided over by the Akamba Clans Governing Council of Elders, Mr Sonko dressed in traditional Akamba attire and received ceremonial regalia, including a quiver, a bow and arrows. In a brief but emotional speech, Mr Sonko regretted that his late father, Kioko Kivanguli, was not around to witness the coronation. He accepted the honour bestowed on him by the elders and promised to serve diligently. "I accept your blessings and even if I am elected as the governor of Nairobi County I will not forget where I came from,‚Äù Mr Sonko said. SONKO RESCUE TEAM Elders, led by Boniface Kilonzo, praised the Sonko Rescue Team for offering vital services to wananchi including helping in weddings and funerals free of charge. The vehicles assist needy people from all parts of Kenya. Mr Sonko's running mate, Polycarp Igathe, thanked the senator for choosing him to work with him and asked for support. "We are ready to serve the people. Mr Mbuvi is a uniting factor as he was voted for by all the tribes in Kenya during the nominations," said Mr Igathe. The elders dismissed as inconsequential Senator Johnson Muthama's endorsement of Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. They said there is nothing wrong with the Kamba community supporting President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election since nobody from the community is vying for the presidency.

The High Court has suspended the decision to fine Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga Sh500,000 for flouting the electoral code of conduct by using Nasa party symbols, logo and its presidential candidate Raila Odinga's photos in his campaign materials. Mr Akaranga, of the Progressive Party of Kenya, was fined by IEBC after Mr Ibrahim Memba accused him of unlawfully using Nasa colours and logos yet his party is not a member of the coalition. However, Justice George Odunga has temporarily suspended the decision.

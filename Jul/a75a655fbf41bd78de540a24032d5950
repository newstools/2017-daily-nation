AFC Leopards should consider being run by a board of directors with the chairman and the secretary general being the most important people. That is the only way to fix the perpetual crisis that the club is suffering from.The chairman and secretary s roles should be to hire an Chief Executive Officer who will be responsible for running the secretariat while his bosses must ensure that the club policies are implemented.They must have fixed terms of office to give new members with fresh ideas a chance to lead this great club.All the board members should have a background in corporate management and leadership.It is appropriate for the board or its Personnel Committee to do a formal performance appraisal at least annually.Under this leadership, the club should have a public relations officer, marketing officer and a qualified accountant.However, if extensive board time is required for fund raising to implement programs, then a much larger board is in order.The expanded board can start and add members as the need arises. Additional candidates for the board membership can be nominated either in advance of from the floor during a club Annual General Meeting.Voting in officials has become political and as a result created factions with rival groups fighting for club control.But for our beloved club to have the management board in place it should first of all transform from a society to a limited company - where members can have shares.Once the members start having shares people will stop stealing money because there will be checks and balances to end the misuse of club assets.All the shareholders will have a keen interest in the club affairs.All successful clubs in the world are run like business enterprises where member have shares and are informed of the day-to-day affairs of their clubs, but in Kenya the situation in different due to lack structures, giving officials loopholes to loot.Most Ingwe fans expected the team to be challenging for top honours this season after starting the league on a high note, only for that promising momentum to disappear leaving the boys in danger of actually facing a relegation fight.Our incoming new coach, Robert Matano The Lion has a huge task of turning around the team fortunes.I know the former Sofapaka, Tusker, City Stars and Ulinzi Stars tactician is capable of reviving the limping Leopards. AFC Leopards is my club. I played for them. I have coached there before and I m going back to manage them again, Matano said when accepting the job.He is aware of this great club whose record is only second to our lucky, noisy neighbours.I m convinced that Matano is the right man for the job and we are confident he can take us back to the top third of the table.We need to stay together and keep our focus on how best we can finish in a respectable position on the table.A habit of changing players and the technical bench members will not help Ingwe because the problem is poor management.There must really be consistency as we build a strong and mighty team that will send shivers of terror down the spine of any opponent we face.For we are the Ingwe. email print email print

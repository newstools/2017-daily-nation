Nairobi governorship candidate Peter Kenneth has promised to ensure all households in the city get clean water in their taps if he is elected as the county boss on August 8. Speaking during a campaign rally in Zimmerman, Roysambu Constituency, Mr Kenneth said that he will deliver water in all city taps within one year and clear the garbage in the city in three months. He said that lack of water and poor garbage disposal as well as infiltration of water cartels in the city is to blame for the current cholera outbreak. “We have said that we must ensure that all estates get safe water within one year. We will track water lines to ensure there is no tampering and there are no water cartels. We will ensure that these things work,” he said. The independent gubernatorial candidate also said that his administration will reduce license fees for small-scale traders from the current Sh18,000 to Sh5,000 in an effort to allow many people venture into business. “I will make sure that under my administration the hiked license fees that stand at Sh18,000 will be reviewed downwards to Sh5,000 especially for those doing salon business,” he said. He further said that if elected, all constituencies will have modern markets and all revenue collected there will remain there to help create jobs for young people in those areas.

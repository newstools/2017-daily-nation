The world is finally at the home of athletics. The IAAF World U18 Championships is going on at the iconic Safaricom Stadium in Kasarani, Nairobi. President Uhuru Kenyatta officially welcomed the over 800 athletes drawn from 131 countries on Wednesday as he declared free entry to the stadium. This is the second time Kenya is hosting a world championships after the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Mombasa that attracted a record 40,000 fans. It is also the second major track and field event since the 1987 All-Africa Games at the same venue. Fans play an integral role at such championships and itâ€™s their huge turnout that plays part in countries winning bids from major world sports events. This is why it is important for Kenyans to turn out in large numbers to cheer their athletes to victory. This is the time to show the world love by filling the 60,000-seater Kasarani arena. Already, Kenya is interested in hosting the IAAF World U20 and World championships based on the success of the current event in the country.

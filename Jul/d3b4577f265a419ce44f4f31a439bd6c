Jubilee losers in Murang’a County have accused the party of fronting relatives and girlfriends of senior politicians in the party's nomination list forwarded to IEBC. The losers have expressed their disappointment to the party’s secretariat, saying they have been short-changed since they had been promised to be given the first priority in the nomination slots. Daniel Mwaura, who unsuccessfully vied for the Kambiti MCA seat on a Jubilee ticket during the primaries, said he regretted why he backed off after the nominations. "The Jubilee nominations were shambolic but we adhered to our president's plea and stepped down despite my supporters wish (for me) to vie as an independent candidate only (for us) to be treated as outsiders in our own party which we have invested a lot in,” said Mwaura. OUTRAGEOUS On her part, Esther Nyakio from Ithanga Ward, described the party list that has been forwarded to IEBC as outrageous, claiming that the bona fide members of the party were not consulted when the names were being suggested. Her sentiments were echoed by the secretary-general of the Jubilee Party in Murang’a, Mr Joel Irungu Mwaniki, who insisted that the laid down rules and regulations of the party were not followed. "Article 7 of Jubilee Party's constitution explains clearly the process of coming up with the nominees," Mr Mwaniki said. He accused Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria, Jubilee Senate nominee Irungu Kang’ata and Woman Representative Sabina Chege of rewarding their cronies without following the legal process. He welcomed the losers’ idea of challenging the list in court vowing to support the litigations. Daily Nation has learnt that a group of losers who were not considered in the list are contemplating filing a lawsuit against Jubilee Party over the proposed list.

SAN FRANCISCOFor a few San Francisco visionaries, rodents proved just the inspiration needed to launch one of the city's latest eateries: The Rat Cafe.The pop-up cafe, which opened Saturday, offers visitors a chance to munch on a breakfast of pastries, coffee and tea, and enjoy a bit of play time with a small handful of rats.Hosted inside The San Francisco Dungeon, an immersive tourist attraction that takes visitors on a journey through the city's dark past from Alcatraz to the violence and greed of the Gold Rush, the Sh5,000 ($50) breakfast was conceived after some employees began pondering the venue's section on a black death plague that struck in the early 20th century."We tell the story of the (bubonic) plague here in San Francisco and we really thought we wanted to do something special for the summer," said the Dungeon's Matthew Gunter.Sprout the rat cleans herself while standing on the shoulders of a Rattie Ratz volunteer during a popup Rat Cafe at the San Francisco Dungeon in San Francisco, California on July 1, 2017.

The venue says more breakfasts may be planned at a future date.Krissi Reeves, a spokeswoman for the Dungeon, said tickets for the July 1 and 8 events sold out in less than an hour."The rats are pretty darn cute and the people who purchased tickets, I think they have already decided that they're gonna like the rats and not be too scared," she said.The rats are provided by Rattie Ratz, a California non-profit that helps place pet rats in homes."They love to be petted, they're very affectionate. They're way more affectionate than any small animal I know," said the organization's Jennifer Girgar.The Rat Cafe opens amid a booming cat cafe trend in parts of Asia and even the United States and Europe, in which visitors sip beverages surrounded by felines which are often available for adoption. email print email print

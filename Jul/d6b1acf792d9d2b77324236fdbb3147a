Evergreen midfielder Hillary Echesa broke the deadlock after 17 minutes. Against Stima, Leopards settled down fast and found the net after just three minutes when Duncan Otieno s corner kick was headed home by Okaka.Eight minutes later, Leopards were celebrating again as Mawira doubled the scores by making the most of a sumptuous cross from Vincent Oburu.ULINZI OUTAt Afraha, Ulinzi will blame themselves for early exit, as they controlled the proceedings particularly the second half where they wasted at least five clear cut chances. Sony got their big break three minutes into the match after Ulinzi stopper Mohammed Rio Hassan recklessly tackled striker Laban Gambareko inside the box, prompting referee Anthony Ogwayo to point to the penalty spot. Sony Sugar top scorer Amos Asembeka successfully took the resultant spot kick, sending Ulinzi custodian Jacktone Odhiambo diving on the wrong side. Enosh Ochieng' should have levelled the scores for Ulinzi in the 70th minute but his grass cutter was parried out by the outstretching goalkeeper Kevin Omondi for a fruitless corner.In the 81st minute, Ulinzi wasted another golden opportunity to take the game to penalties after Daniel Waweru blockbuster missed the target.A crestfallen fallen Ulinzi Stars coach Benjamin Nyangweso blamed lady luck for the defeat."It was simply not our day. We had our chances but we missed the target and this was our undoing," said Nyangweso.Sony coach Salim Babu was an elated man after the match and hailed his boys for holding on to an early goal."The early goal was a big blessing to us as we defended it well and this paid dividends after the 90 minutes," said Babu.Ulinzi resume their hunt for the SportsPesa Premier League with an away match against Nakumatt while Sony will also be away to Mathare United next weekend.RESULTSZetech University 0-1 Kakamega Homeboyz (Mumias)AFC Leopards 2-0 Nairobi Stima (Mumias)Mwatate 0-2 Butterfly (Wundanyi Stadium)Kenpoly 0-1 Kariobangi Sharks (Machakos)Nakumatt vs Modern Coast Rangers (Machakos)Ulinzi 0-1 Sony Sugar (Afraha)Karatina Homeboyz 1-2 GFE 105 (Thika)Sofapaka 1-0 Western Stima (Thika)Young Divers 0-2 Eldoret Youth (Mbaraki)Reports by Titus Maero, Francis Muriethi, Vincent Opiyo and Cellestine Olilo email print email print The match turned physical as each outfit tried frantically to break the deadlock.

Caren Chebet led compatriot Mercy Chepkurui to a 1-2 sweep of the top podium places in the girls’ 2,000m steeplechase final at the IAAF World Under-18 Championships at Moi International Sports Centre on Friday. Chebet lived up to her promise when she won girls’ 2,000m steeplechase title, beating Chepkirui, who tumbled on the last water barrier at Kasarani.   The leading Chepkirui tumbled at the water barrier to see Chebet pass her but Chepkirui regained the lead up until the last 20m where Chebet stepped on her gas pedal to win in a World Under-18 lead time of 6 minutes and 24.80 seconds.   The Form Four student at Saramek Secondary School in Kericho County edged out Chepkirui to second place in a personal best of 6:26.10 as Ethiopian Etalemahu Sintayehu settled for bronze in 6:35.79.   The 1-2 feat by Chebet and Chepkirui upheld Kenya’s dominance in women’s 2,000m steeplechase at World Under-18 Championships, where the country has won four consecutive editions in 2011 (Lille, France), 2013 (Donetsk, Ukraine) and the 2015 edition (Cali, Colombia). That Kenyans have won five out of six events since the 2,000m steeplechase was introduced to the world youth event in 2007 Ostrava, Czech Republic, goes without saying. It’s Caroline Tuigong who set the ball rolling with victory in Ostrava. Ethiopian Korahubsh Itaa might have won the 2009 Brixen in Italy but the Kenyans girls were able to reclaim the title when Norah Jeruto won in 2011 Lille. Kenya has not let go of the title since then, with Rosefline Chepng'etich winning the 2013 Donetsk edition before Celliphine Chespol, the current World Under-20 champion and national record holder, upheld Kenya’s strong tradition in 2015 Cali.   Kenya's George Manangoi is the 1500m World Under 18 Championships gold medallist.

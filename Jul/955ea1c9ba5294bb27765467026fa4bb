Anti-corruption detectives in Isiolo have arrested a man said to be an agent of a top Marsabit politician for attempting to bribe an IEBC official. The Sh200,000 bribe was meant to influence the returning officer to deploy to Marsabit poll officials who are ‘friendly’ to the governor candidate. 46 OFFICERS Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) eastern region official Ignatius Wekesa on Tuesday said Mr Salesa Adano was arrested at the Northern Galaxy Hotel in Isiolo town. Mr Wekesa said a Marsabit-based returning officer reported to the EACC that the suspect wanted 46 presiding officers and their deputies to be deployed to different constituencies in Marsabit. “We arrested him after a tip-off from the returning officer," said Mr Wekesa. “He had Sh200,000 and a list of people he wanted deployed to polling stations.” COURT Reliable sources told the Nation that the suspect, identified as a former District Education Officer in Marsabit, is a close relative of one of the top politicians eyeing the county's governorship. Mr Wekesa said the suspect would be arraigned in court once investigations are complete. “We have not yet made a decision to release him on a cash bail and he is still being held at the station,” said Mr Wekesa.

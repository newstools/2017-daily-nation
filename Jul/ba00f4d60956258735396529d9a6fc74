Kenya under coach John van Liefland leave Nairobi on Monday for Uganda by road ready for the second edition of the rotational Victoria Cup golf championship that will be held at the lake-side Entebbe Golf Club this week.Hosts Uganda have picked their team to take on defending champions Kenya.The strong 11-man squad was selected last week following a gruelling 72-hole national team trial held at Entebbe, where Toro golfer Adolf Muhumuza topped the qualifying list with a total of 12 points to make his way back to the Uganda team.One of the best matchplay golfers in Uganda, Muhumuza was left out of the Africa Region Five team in Kitwe in April.The team of 10 players and a reserve which went into training straight away under coach Amos Kamya, includes three new faces David Kamulindwa, home player Davis Kato and Emma Ogwang.Others are Oscar Ssemwere, Edwin Tumusiime, Ronald Rugumayo, Becca Mwanja (captain) and Deco Mutebi. email print email print

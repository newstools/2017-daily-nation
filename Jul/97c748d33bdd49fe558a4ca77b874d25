Dear Brenda,I m 25 years old and I have met a great guy. He checks most boxes on my list of requirements of a boyfriend but my problem is that he is very short! I am even afraid to introduce him to my friends how do I deal with this?IreneAt 25, you shouldn t be worried about approval from your friends regarding who you date. That ship has sailed. Second, no man will tick off all the boxes on that list you have made. I repeat: no man.What you need to do is determine which qualities in a man really matter to you. Which ones are deal breakers? Remember that physical attraction is important in a romantic relationship. If this man is as good as you say he is, if you are physically attracted to him, then it shouldn t matter that he is short or that your friends will laugh at you.Got a problem for Brenda?

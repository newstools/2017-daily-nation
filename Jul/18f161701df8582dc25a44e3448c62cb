LONDON Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil is close to signing a new contract with the Gunners, according to British media reports on Friday. The German World Cup winner's current deal runs out at the end of the 2017/18 season, but Arsenal are confident of wrapping up negotiations in the next couple of weeks. According to reports, the terms for the 28-year-old's proposed new deal are around £280,000 ($363,000, 313,000 euros, Sh37 million) a week, which would make him the club's top earner, although it's believed that Ozil was originally holding out for closer to £350,000. Ozil and Chile international forward Alexis Sanchez have both been linked with moves away from Emirates Stadium this summer, with Sanchez attracting interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. Ozil signed for the north Londoners in a £42.5 million ($55.3 million, 47.5 million euros, Sh5.5 billion) deal from Real Madrid in 2013.   "He has said he wants to leave. I wish him all the best."

If the vibrancy in the Team Kenya camp ahead of the London World Championships in 11 days is anything to go by, the country should expect a replica of the 2015 Beijing performance. Kenya topped the medal standings in Beijing for the very first time, what with a major boost from Nicholas Bett and Julius Yego, who shone in the 400m hurdles and javelin, respectively. The team under head coach Julius Kirwa may have only been in training for over a week now, but the mood is ecstatic. However, it could be enhanced if the uncertainty over the men’s 800m team and the absence of four athletes could be addressed. TRIALS The 800m race will be critical, and hence Athletics Kenya must come up with a solution that will leave all happy. AK had come up with a 1-2-3 across-the-line rule during the trials, but a selection dilemma arose in events that had two wild cards, including the men’s 800m. Besides, discipline must be upheld in the camp with all the athletes treated equally. DOPING AK must act fast since time is running out. Doping has been a thorny issue. The Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) should have athletes who have not complied with the three-out-of competition mandatory tests do so. It will be terrible if some are to be barred from taking part for failing to meet that requirement. While Adak says that all is well, a last-minute rush must be avoided.

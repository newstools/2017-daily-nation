My girlfriend and I have been dating for seven years though we rarely see each other because she is still in school.I am in college while she is in high school. The last time I called her, she gave the phone to a friend, who pretended that she was my girlfriend. It is only later that I realised it was not her I had talked to. Now she is accusing me of cheating on her, yet I have not. I love her, and I am stressed out. I need help. Hello,What I gather from your email is that both of you are very young, and that you started dating at a very young age if you have been together for seven years. Your behaviour is also immature, which makes me wonder whether you are ready for a relationship. Seven years is too long to be playing such games, and by now, both of you should know whether you want this relationship or not.I suggest that you and your girlfriend get together and decide once and for all how you intend to relate, but most important, find out whether this relationship is good for you. Maybe you were just good friends that were never meant to be in a relationship. email print email print

Kenya Railway Golf Club s Alfred Nandwa overcame an early double bogey at the par five-fourth to eventually finish off an impressive three under par 69 in the first round of this year s Limuru Open at the par 72 Limuru Country Club course on Saturday.Before the double at the 457 yards fourth hole, Nandwa, one of the national team players had made two birdies at the first and third before winding up the front nine with two successive birdies at the eighth and ninth.He dropped two shots at the 11th and 13th of the back nine, but made a good finish, picking up birdies at the 14th, 16th and the 18th to take a three shots lead from home player and tournament favourite John Karichu, who shot level par 72 as he embarked on the afternoon s second round of the World Amateur Ranking event. Karichu started off with a double bogey at the par four-second hole, but birdied the seventh to carry over the back nine a one over par. He got the back nine under way with a birdie at the 10th, parred the rest to level the course, leaving Royal Nairobi s Jay Sandhu leading a group of three including club-mate Dennis Saikwa and local player Dennis Maara on one over par 73.

That Kenya recently won five medals at the African Confederation Boxing Championships in Congo-Brazzaville that double as the World Championships qualifier, is inspiring. This is how the national boxing team, fondly known as the “Hit Squad”, can rediscover its old winning touch. Three men and two women have done the country proud. The championships are scheduled for August 25 to September 3. It is a shame that the trip to Brazzaville almost failed to take place due to lack of funds. IMPROVE PERFORMANCE More boxers should take part in such events to compete with others and thus improve their performance. Kenya only had three boxers at the 2016 Rio Olympics, which was pretty dismal, considering that the country sent a full squad to the 1988 Olympics. While Boxing Association of Kenya ought to intensify its campaign to woo sponsors through proper marketing strategies and upholding integrity, the government must also play its role. The last-minute funding doesn’t help in preparing teams well. TRAINING ABROAD It’s through participating in international sporting events that our sportsmen and women will gauge their standards. The government should assist federations by sending technical officials for training abroad to upgrade themselves in the dynamic sporting world. These officials will then play a vital role in the development of sports.

Keringet’s Edina Jebitok and Rachel Nzangi from Machakos are under pressure on Saturday to reclaim the girls’ 1,500m title that Olympic 1,500m champion Faith Chepng’etich last won for Kenya at 2011 Championships in Lille, France. The duo will also be aiming at bettering the championship record of 4:09.48 set by Chepng’etich, who is their role model. Keringet area of Kuresoi South, Nakuru County, has produced some of Kenya’s revered world beaters in athletics including Chepng’etich, Olympic 10,000 metres silver medallist Paul Tanui and the 2016 Diamond League 800 metres series winner Ferguson Rotich among others. That is the rich legacy that Jebitok, the shy class seven pupil at Keringet Estate Primary School, is aiming to maintain. Machakos too, has also produced some world beaters the likes of World 5,000m silver medallist Caleb Mwangangi and Commonwealth 3,000m steeplechase champion Jonathan Muia. Nzangi too wants to follow in their footsteps especially Mwangangi, who won the 2008 World-Under 1,500m silver and gold at the 2010 World Under-20. “It’s my dream to win the title by breaking Chepng’etich’s record. I am sure she will be happy for me,” says Jebitok, who trains in Keringet alongside Chepng’etich. “I really admire how Chepng’etich has been rising and I’m glad to be training with her in Keringet,” said Jebitok, adding that the world youth race won’t be a walk in the park considering the challenge posed by Ethiopia, who have won the last two editions in 2013 Donetsk and 2015 Cali, Colombia. “Their reign must come to the end and winning at this final youth edition will be great,” vowed Jebitok, who won the Kenyan trials in 4:16.90. Nzangi is also determined to not only reach the podium but win for Kenya. “I won’t mind who finishes at the top but as so long as it’s me or Jebitok. We are at home and we must be felt.” Bulgaria’s Lilyana Georgieva is likely to be in the medal shake-up, the 16-year-old boasting a PB of 4:20.01 which she ran indoors in Istanbul earlier this year. She warmed up for Nairobi by taking victory at the Balkan Junior Championships two weeks ago in 4:31.76. Kenya's rivals Ethiopia have Lemlem Hailu Techane and Sindu Girma Sina, who have clocked 4:20 this season. Of the others, South African pair Nicole Louw and Lyndi Roelfse, who have run 4:21.44 and 4:22.62 respectively this season, pose the biggest threat to spoil the party for the hosts.   Cheptoo’s personal and season best was 31.96 coming into the competition.

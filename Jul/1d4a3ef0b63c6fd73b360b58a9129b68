Hundreds of dignitaries are expected to join residents at the home of former Cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott in Keiyo South, where he is set to be laid to rest on Thursday. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto are among those expected to witness the last journey of one of the most prominent personalities from the Kanu era. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich on Wednesday confirmed that the two Jubilee leasers would attend the burial ceremony at Maria Soti Secondary School before he is buried at his home in Toot village. Mr Biwott, popularly known as 'Total Man', died in Nairobi on July 11 after a long illness. On Wednesday, his three widows and seven children were introduced to hundreds who turned up to view his body at Biwott Day Secondary School in Keiyo South ahead of his burial. The three – Hannie Kiprono, Margaret Kamar and Kalista Lessie – stood in front of the crowd and held each other’s hands and expressed their sadness at losing a man they said had taken good care of them. Mr Biwott had seven children – six daughters and a son – who were all introduced on Wednesday.

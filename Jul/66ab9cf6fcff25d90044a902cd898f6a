DEAL STILL IN PLACE The staff have been on strike since Monday to push for the implementation of Sh10 billion collective bargaining agreement for 2013-2017 . "There is no dispute at all. The government is not saying that there is no money or collective bargaining agreement (CBA) but we have to be understanding and accommodative," the CS said. He disclosed that he had directed university councils to immediately embark on new talks for the 2017-2021 CBA. BALANCEDr Matiang’i observed that the decision to pay the staff Sh4.8 billion was done since the accord was signed at the tail end of the 2016/2017 financial year but assured that the remaining Sh5.2 billion will be paid this financial year. "The remaining money will be released as part of the capitation to universities. We must at all times as stakeholders demonstrate good faith and trust if we hope to develop this country," he said.

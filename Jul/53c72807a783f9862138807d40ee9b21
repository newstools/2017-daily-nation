An ongoing anti-riot police drill in Kisumu town has caused anxiety among residents and leaders. Police officers in the town have been engaged in security activities in the past few days, with only 12 days left to the August 8 General Election. On Tuesday, Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga and Kisumu City Residents Voice chairman Audi Ogada raised questions about the public display of weapons by the police ahead of the elections. “We are concerned by the ongoing police activities in Kisumu town as this borders on intimidation of voters ahead of the elections. “Why are they conducting the drill now? Are they pre-empting violence? We want acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to tell us what is happening to restore confidence among the people,” Ms Odinga said. SCARE VOTERS Mr Ogada said conducting an anti-riot police drill a few days to elections was scaring the voters. “This is creating tension and anxiety among voters. Are they trying to make a communication that they are ready to deal with the people? "Tension is simmering over the matter especially among non-indigenous people and the business community and this does not auger well,” added Mr Ogada. He said the government needs to explain why the police were conducting public drills “and displaying their anti-riot gear.” Nyanza Regional Coordinator Wilson Njega, however, said there was no cause for alarm. “Our security officers are ready for any eventuality. They are carrying out an anti-riot drill but this should not worry people,” Mr Njega said. Security officers have been conducting the drill outside Moi Stadium in Kisumu. Mr Njega told residents to remain calm as that was part of the officers' preparations to enhance security. “Whether there is violence or no violence security agencies will be ready. We don’t operate in a vacuum. You plan even for the worst,” he said.

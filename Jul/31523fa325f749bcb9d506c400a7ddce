A 38-year-old man from Nkumari village, Tharaka-Nithi County has been found dead in what is suspected to be suicide. The body of Mr Charles Mutembei was found hanging on a tree and a rope tied around his neck on Saturday night, area chief Stanley Marangu confirmed. According to him, the deceased had been unwell and that he had been taken to hospital by his elder sister on Thursday but did not disclose what he was suffering from. A family member who spoke to the Nation.co.ke on condition of anonymity, as she is not allowed to speak to media on behalf of the family, said they had no idea of what could have pushed the man to take his life. His body has been taken by police to Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary awaiting post-mortem as part of investigations to establish the real cause of his death. Mr Marangu urged families to always keep an eye to their ailing members to avoid such incidences that could be as a result of psychological disturbances.

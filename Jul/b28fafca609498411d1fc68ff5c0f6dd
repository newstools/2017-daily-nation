Rapper Prezzo is ready to set aside his differences with fellow musician turned politician Jaguar and support him in his political career only if he plans on effecting change.Prezzo was on the radio show Mambo Mseto where fans had an opportunity to call in and interact with him. Why do you hate Jaguar? Asked a fan. Who said I hate Jaguar? he asked the fan. He however did not want to get into the entire history of their beef and politely told him it was something that he did not wish to revisit.He still continued: If he intends to bring change why wouldn t I support him? Do you remember he supported me when I was on the Big Brother reality show? Then why shouldn t we support each other my brother? Fans then proceeded to remind Prezzo, real name Jackson Makini, that Jaguar had asked him to join him in the fight against drugs abuse while he was at NACADA. If we can help and support the youth I don t see why we can t join hands in helping each other out, he retorted. email print email print Rapper Prezzo is ready to set aside his differences with fellow musician turned politician Jaguar and support him in his political career only if he plans on effecting change.

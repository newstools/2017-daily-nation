What has often been described as a barren little rock in Lake Victoria, Migingo Island, could have sparked a serious conflict between Kenya and Uganda, had it not been carefully handled. The island is, of course, famous for its bountiful fish that attract fishermen from the two countries. Indeed, Migingo may be nothing but rock, but it’s a source of a delicacy and a livelihood, fish. KENYAN TERRITORY But all is well that ends well. President Uhuru Kenyatta has just confirmed that the island is, indeed, a part of Kenyan territory, and this should come as really good news for Kenyans, who were stunned when Uganda laid claim to it, and belligerently deployed its security forces. There have been a lot of provocations, with the Ugandans making life difficult for Kenyan fishermen, but all that should now give way to greater harmony between the neighbours. MAPPING According to President Kenyatta, officials are now mapping the island’s boundary in and it’s thanks to diplomacy instead of sabre rattling that could have wrecked the cordial relations between the two East African Community member states. The next step is a complete takeover so that the Ugandan security personnel can withdraw. This amicable resolution of the dispute is a good example of how to tackle rows that crop up between even good neighbours time and again.

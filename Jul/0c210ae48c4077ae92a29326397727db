A lawyer attached to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) customs department was on Wednesday morning found murdered and is body dumped along Mombasa Road. Mr Jared Ratemo’s body was discovered early morning by motorists who alerted the police from Embakasi Station. His identification documents were found on him. Confirming the incident, Embakasi DCIO Peter Ndubi said investigations into the death of the lawyer had been initiated. He refuted claims that he had been shot. “We are still investigating the circumstances under which he died, but we suspect he may have been murdered elsewhere before his body was dumped there,” Mr Ndubi said. The Lawyer’s brother, Harun Mokua said Mr Ratemo, a father of three, was abducted on Tuesday, days after he had travelled to Nairobi to solve undisclosed tax issues. MOST FOUL MURDER A few hours before he disappeared, Mr Ratemo was to travel back to Mombasa where he is stationed, aboard a 9.30am flight. It is not clear yet, whether he went to his office in Ngara that morning, as he had planned.An email notifying staff about Mr Ratemo’s death was circulated at the Authority, with the HR department saying that the body was taken to the Chiromo Mortuary. “Until his death, he was serving as a supervisor in customs and Border Control Department Consol base CFS in Mombasa,” the email said. Lawyers have condemned the killing and called for speedy investigations. In statement, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) President Isaac Okero said: “The circumstances of Ratemo’s demise point to a most foul murder at the hands of people he was familiar with. “This incident coming barely a month following the brutal murder of another lawyer, Ronald Lubya and one year following the brutal murder of lawyer Willie Kimani has shaken the society to its core.”

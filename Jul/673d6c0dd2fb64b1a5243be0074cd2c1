President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected in Kisumu on Wednesday, County Commissioner Mohammed Maalim has said. He, however, said the Presidentâ€™s official programme will be released by State House. Among key projects that the President is expected to launch is the commissioning of the Ahero-Kisii-Isebania road construction. President Kenyatta is also expected to address rallies as he heads to Homa Bay County to launch the Mbita-Rusinga bridge. The President's visit has sparked mixed reactions from local leaders, who feel he rarely visits the region. The President had in June toured parts of Nyanza. He visited Kisii and Nyamira counties to seek support from voters for his re-election bid on a Jubilee ticket.

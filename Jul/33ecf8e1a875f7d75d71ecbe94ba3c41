PHOTO| THOMAS MATIKOFans have been pushing them to do a collabo and Nation.co.ke recently asked Nameless, currently riding high with his hit song Inspire , why they have never made it happen: Hehehe! Hiyo kazi itakuja, tumekuwa tukienda studio but plan yetu mwanzoni haikuwa tuwahi kufanya kazi pamoja. Strategy yetu ilikuwa tufanya separately. Lakini in the last one year ndio tumekuwa tukiangalia hiyo kazi sasa because tunafeel sasa ndio time. (The collaboration is in the pipeline, we have been recording together. We always planned to have separate careers but over the last one year, we changed our minds and we have been looking into prospects of a collabo. There is something cooking as we feel this is the right time.)Nameless, whose real name is David Mathenge, added that their idea of making music separately grew from their desire to establish strong independent brands as individual musicians and not as a couple. We did this because we wanted to create separate strong brands. We are married and thus if we were to work together, then we would have had one brand. But after having managed to create our separate brands, that s when we started thinking of coming together. email print email print

The National Super Alliance (Nasa) will on Tuesday campaign in Kakamega County, a perceived stronghold for the opposition coalition in western region. The Nasa campaign team is seeking to consolidate support enjoyed by the opposition in the county in the wake of a sustained onslaught by President Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto. Nasa co-principals, who include its flag bearer Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula are expected to traverse Malava, Lugari and Likuyani on Tuesday. They will head to Navakholo, Matungu, Mumias East and Mumias West on Wednesday. The Jubilee brigade has held several rallies in Kakamega County in the last two months. In their campaigns, President Kenyatta and Mr Ruto have been asking voters in Kakamega to look at projects the Jubilee administration had initiated in the region in the last four an half year and reciprocate by re-electing them. But Nasa has dismissed pledges by Jubilee as empty promises meant to hoodwink voters in Kakamega to support President Kenyatta’s re-election.

Police in Mombasa are holding three suspects who were arrested with cocaine worth millions of shillings. The three, including a woman, were seized on Saturday in Nyali suburb. FOREIGNER Police sources identified the three as Bilali, Athman and Kagendo. Kisauni police chief Christopher Rotich on Sunday said more than four vehicles belonging to the suspects were also seized during the operation. “We are yet to establish the exact value but it worth millions from the quantity,” he said. “The three were arrested at different places within Nyali. One is a foreigner and the other two are Kenyans.” Mr Rotich said the three would be taken to court Monday to face drug trafficking charges. The arrests come weeks after the anti-narcotics police arrested two Nigerian nationals with 1.5kg of heroin with a street value of Sh4.5 million. The duo were apprehended in Nyali, which police say has become notorious for illegal businesses.

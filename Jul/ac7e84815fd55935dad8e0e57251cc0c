Hundreds of supporters of Governor Nathif Jama on Tuesday poured to the streets over reports that his Sh5.2 billion bank account has been frozen. Business and traffic in Garissa town were equally paralysed as protesters, some aboard campaign vehicles and tuk tuks, chanted pro-Jama slogans who they claimed was being targeted unfairly. Speaking outside Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) offices in Garissa, Waberi ward ODM Candidate Abdirizack Ismail claimed the Governor had been frustrated by the agency unreasonably. “What we are asking is why target Governor Nathif only when the same jubilee government has been involved in major scandals such as NYS and others and we have not seen similar treatment,” he told hundreds of protesters. The demonstrators were repulsed by armed police officers when they attempted to forcibly enter the EACC offices. Mr Ismail claimed that documents claimed that documents from First Community Bank used by anti-graft agency to freeze the governor’s account are ‘fake’ as the bank has already distanced itself. Governor Jama has denied that he owns a Sh5.2 billion account which was frozen by the High Court in Nairobi.   The EACC sought legal intervention after suspect money was wired from Garissa county government to private account.

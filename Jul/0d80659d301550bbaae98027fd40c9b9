Police in Homa Bay County are investigating the circumstances under which a parliamentary candidate went ‘missing’ last Saturday. Mr Ezra Odhiambo who is contesting Rangwe parliamentary seat on the Green Congress of Kenya (GCK) party ticket, has not been seen since the last Saturday, according to accounts by family members. Family members and friends are worried about his safety since he left home on Saturday. They had reported the matter to the police after waiting for his return in vain. NOT PICKING CALLS Homa Bay OCPD Esau Ochorokodi said their preliminary investigations had revealed that Mr Odhiambo’s mobile phone number was ringing but not being answered. “We have called his phone number which is ringing but nobody could receive it,” said Mr Ochorokodi. The OCPD told Rangwe residents to be calm as they conduct investigations for knowing health of the politician and his whereabouts. "Those who talk about abduction should hold their horses because somebody may decide to conduct his affairs in a secret environment. “We are investigating the matter to unearth the truth about it,” said Mr Ochorokodi.

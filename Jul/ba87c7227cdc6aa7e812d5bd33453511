Hi Brenda,I'm 25 and I met a girl on Facebook. We exchanged numbers and set a date. When we met, my heart sank. She is too short. She is about four feet tall while I am six feet tall. The problem is that I'm developing romantic feelings towards her but I'm afraid to introduce her to my friends, let alone my parents. What can I do? Please advice.The first thing you need to realise is that your romantic relationships are between you and your love interest, not between you and your whole clan.If you like this girl, if you want to be with her, then be with her. Everybody else will come around. Her height should only be a problem to you if it makes you feel differently about her.You need to grow a thicker skin.Got a problem for Brenda?

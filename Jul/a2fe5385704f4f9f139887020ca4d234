The strike has officially kicked off at the University of Nairobi (UoN) and at Kisii, Egerton and Maasai Mara universities despite government efforts to stop it. SH4.8BN On Sunday, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i urged the workers and lecturers not to resort to industrial action “as the ministry has already wired Sh4.775 billion into the respective bank accounts of 31 public universities and colleges”.   But Kenya University Staff Union (Kusu) Secretary-General Charles Mukhwaya on Monday said they had not received any money in their bank accounts. University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga had a similar response to Dr Matangi on Sunday. UoN workers marched in the streets of Nairobi, chanting "solidarity forever" as they vented their displeasure with the government.   At Maasai Mara, Kusu branch Secretary-General Stanley Yiale led the industrial action and asked the government to honour the agreement in full. He said there was no agreement that the Sh10 billion was to be paid in two tranches as claimed by Dr Matiang'i. The respective trade unions are fighting for the full execution of the CBA they signed with the government in March. 17.5PC RAISE In the deal that ended a 54-day strike that had paralysed learning in all public universities, the workers were awarded a 17.5 per cent pay increase The strike is likely to hit learning at more than 30 public universities and their constituent colleges across the country with more than 500,000 students.

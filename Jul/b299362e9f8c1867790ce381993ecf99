Unknown gunmen on Thursday night shot dead a businessman in Chebukwabi village, Kimilili constituency, in Bungoma County. Robert Barasa, a known campaigner for Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka, was shot dead by armed men in his home. The 56-year-old father of seven was killed when he confronted the assailants, who entered his home through a window. Kimilili OCPD Mary Wakuu said police were investigating the killing. The gunmen also shot the businessman’s son in the leg before fleeing. He was admitted to Kimilili Sub-County Hospital. Governor Lusaka sent his condolences to the family and urged the police to speed up investigations. “He was my staunch supporter and campaigner. Police should find out who committed this heinous act,” he said. He called on police officers to be alert to ensure that people’s lives and property are protected during the campaign period.

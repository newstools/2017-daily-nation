National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale on Friday said the National Security Council has powers to deploy the military. Mr Duale said the council could deploy security officers to specific areas without necessarily seeking parliamentary approval since the House is not in session. “The National Security Council has an exceptional mandate to deploy KDF and other security organs to areas where lives and properties of Kenyans are at risk,” he said. His statement comes after the National Super Alliance (Nasa) went to court to challenge the deployment of armed forces to areas perceived as possible violence hotspots. The Garissa Town MP urged the security agents to be hard on politicians and anyone who will attempt to disrupt peace during the elections. He added that KDF has an obligation to protect Kenyans and nobody could intimidate them. Mr Duale also told off the Nasa flag-bearer Raila Odinga for criticising acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i. This is after Dr Matiang’i termed as unlawful Nasa’s adopt a polling station strategy saying security agents will deal with any unauthorised individuals around polling stations.

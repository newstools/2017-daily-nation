Why is it that every time I have a man in my life, he either ends up leaving me and getting married to someone else or I find out that he is already married? What s wrong with me? Why am I being used and then dumped? Don t I deserve to be happy? I am 36, and should have been married by now. I think life is unfair to some people like me, as it is, I find it difficult to face my friends and relatives. Hi there,Let me assure you that what you are facing is not unique, therefore you should not allow yourself to go down this road of this self-pity. The pain and anxiety you feel emanates from devaluing yourself. The fact is that our confessions and convictions have a way of molding us into a person we may never have desired to become.I suggest that you start by working towards a strong and health self-view because others see the negativity you surround yourself with as well as your low self-esteem. No one wants to be around someone like this.That said, I am convinced that those married men that came your way were not meant for you, so don t mourn them. Also, those that left you and later got married to someone else were also not meant for you. As you work on becoming a better you, have faith that the one intended for you will come; I pray that when he does, he will find you a woman ready for marriage. email print email print

Lack of food and water has increased the exploitation of women and girls in Turkana County, the International Rescue Committee said on Wednesday. Research by the committee has shown that there is an increase in gender-based violence, early and forced marriage, and women and girls engaging in transactional sex as a direct consequence of food insecurity caused by drought in the region. The IRC said girls as young as 12 years are moving from rural to urban areas to engage in sex for cash, while others were getting married in order to enable their families to buy food. FOOD SCARCITY “The current drought has led to scarcity of food and an increase in women and girls who need support now more than ever,” IRC country director Conor Philips said. Mr Philips said the girls were being solicited in nightclubs for as little as Sh50 in exchange for sex.

GIRL BEATEN “In one specific case, a six-year-old girl was referred to the IRC’s Wellness Centre in Lodwar after being raped and severely beaten by a man who was hosting her and her family. She could no longer hold urine,” IRC said, adding that the man was arrested.

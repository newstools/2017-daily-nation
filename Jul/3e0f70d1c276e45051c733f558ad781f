The Nairobi and Mombasa SGR passenger train will from next Tuesday pick and drop commuters at Mtito Andei and Voi as inter-county service is gradually rolled out. Kenya Railways managing director Atanas Maina said demand by commuters has prompted the decision to allow passengers alight and board at the two stations. Since the launch, two Madaraka Express trains have been departing at 9am daily from both directions, offering a four-and-a-half hour non-stop connection between Nairobi and Mombasa. Plan for stopovers in the nine stations built for the 472km standard gauge railway, including Athi River, Emali, Mariakani, Miasenyi and Kibwezi, was dropped for lack of locomotives.

As soon as we get feedback, we will improve on the service so that all the county stations receive the service in the coming months,” said Maina. “We had hoped to commence the operations of county trains but we thought that before we can do so, we will first continue with intercounty trains. From August 1, we have decided to escalate the service slightly by having two stops on the same service.” The State said more locomotives are needed for the smooth operation of the two inter-county service trains that will supplement the existing Madaraka Express train and travel in both directions.   Uganda has announced plans to start constructing its standard gauge railway (SGR) later this year after it apparently dropped an earlier condition that required Kenya to extend its track to the border first.

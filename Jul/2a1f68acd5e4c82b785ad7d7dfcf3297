Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, the Jubilee Party s candidate for governor in Kiambu, has welcomed opposition leader Raila Odinga's tour of the county and urged residents to maintain calm during the visit.Kiambu is President Uhuru Kenyatta's home county and is largely a Jubilee stronghold.Mr Waititu, Thika town MP Alice Ng'ang'a and Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah have, however, insisted that Mr Odinga must apologise for controversial remarks he made on the campaign trail in Kajiado.Mr Odinga's comments on land had been read by some as implying that if elected, his government would empower residents there to stop selling their land to people from other communities.KAJIADO REMARKSThe three legislators said Kajiado is home to many Kiambu natives who have settled there."Raila has a right to visit Kiambu. He is indeed welcome and we are calling on our people to maintain peace during his visit. "However, we are calling on him to apologise for the remarks he [made] in Kajiado, because they were inciting and caused fear amongst the many Kiambu residents living in Kajiado who now think they will be evicted from their legally acquired properties," said Mr Ichung'wah.KABOGO FACTORMeanwhile, Mr Waititu has accused Governor William Kabogo of being behind the decision by 25 Kiambu MCAs to join Nasa."All the MCAs have been supporters of Kabogo. One even confessed to me how they held a meeting a few days ago where they were each given Sh30,000 in order to join Nasa. They are assuming that their action will give them political relevance but the truth is, they are individually liable for their actions. They have killed their political careers by selling their allegiance to the opposition," said Mr Waititu.Ms Ng'ang'a said Governor Kabogo's aim is to create confusion in the county and consequently divide President Kenyatta's votes."Kabogo vowed that he will not fall and fall alone. That is why he is creating confusion in the county in a bid to divide Uhuru's votes in the region," said Ms Ng'ang'a.The three were speaking during a breakfast radio show. email print email print Raila hopes to convince Kiambu people that Nasa has a solution to their problems.

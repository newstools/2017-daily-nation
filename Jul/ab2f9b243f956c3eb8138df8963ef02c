You are very vocal about social issues, do you fear that might make you lose opportunities?I don t know what I am missing out on because I am a loud mouth but I have always been willing to be fired for standing up for a cause. There is freedom of speech and also freedom of consequences and I am always ready for it whenever I open my mouth.What is success to you? For me it is the ability to do what you do and support your family, yourself, make a living out of it and at the end of the day give back. You have to be beneficial to whatever you do, not just there to extract and never feeding whatever process helps you be a success.Most importantly, if you look up and don t know anybody around you that s been around you for the last two years, then that is not really success. I have very old dear friends, you have to come up with the people around you who can have your back and you can have theirs. Those relationships are really important and mean more than just money or fame.If an entrepreneur came up to you with an idea and needed some of your hard earned money, would you invest in them? I invested early on in the energy sector and worked with different companies that were helping install solar in homes and at-risk neighbourhoods so just looking for ways that help other people, not just myself. I also haven t had a lot of people come up to me with business ideas but it is also a little risky and often you are lighting your money on fire and will never see it again. It is always a gamble.You are one of the ambassadors of Chivas, why did you join forces? The culmination of it all is tonight (14th July, 2017). Working with entrepreneurs and people that are trying to win the right way and to benefit their communities and the world at large. It is important for companies to understand that this should be part of their business models.As a spokesperson, it is more than just putting your name next to a brand or taking a sip on camera, what were you looking at when you joined forces? It was all directly tied to the Chivas Venture where we identify potential leaders. We might just find the next Elon Musk, somebody who will make a change for the better. We need more of those people in the world today and we need to support them.Picking a line from one of your Chivas commercial lines, explain what Winning the right way means to you? It s winning in a way that s not just trying to do it for yourself but also the people around you and your environment. You have to be an advocate for something in society if you have the ability to do it.You are working on a movie about Jeremiah Washington, Wall Street s first black billionaire, would you say he won the right way? He is an anomaly, he shouldn t exist. This was pre-civil war era. He was also not a good dude, a very dirty dude like almost everyone at that time. Is that success really? I wouldn t call it that. He was a black man who was making millions while just down the street, people like him were being lynched. He was a unicorn and when you find a story like that, it is compelling and bizarre.Do you expect backlash once the movie comes out? From the movie? Hopefully, then it can make some money for the movie, controversy is good.Factors that you attribute to your success... Crack. (Laughs) No. Hard work, not taking yourself seriously but being faithful and committed. You have to understand that like every other actor, you will have to go through the five stages of an actor Which are? Who the hell is Don Cheadle, get me Don Cheadle, get me a Don Cheadle type, get me a young Don Cheadle and who the hell is Don Cheadle? This business retires you, you don t retire from it. Once you understand that, then your life becomes easier.People always complain whenever someone gets a Next Don Cheadle, Idris Elba... tag, does it bother you? No it doesn t. The business is very egalitarian in one way, if they think you will make them money, they don t care about what or who you are.I think you are still in the get me Don Cheadle phase what with all the success Well, I don t know, depends on who you ask. As actors, we know that can change at any moment.How do you stay grounded? Crack (laughs). She (points at Chivas PR executive) has a heart attack whenever I mention crack, I find it funny. I used a similar line in South Africa and people almost fainted but they know I am just joking. Family and having genuine friends around me really helps me not lose my mind.At what point did you say I made it ? I don t think I am there yet. I feel like I have made it in a way because I live beneath my means, I have raised kids and taken them through school and I have a house and cars that are all paid for but I am still on the grind and trying to make things happen.Don Cheadle:How s Kenya, last time I was there was a long time ago. Mwaniki: It s still a beautiful place to visit and live, you have a lot of fans, you should come visit again. email print email print

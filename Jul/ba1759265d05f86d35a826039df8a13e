Deputy President William Ruto’s wife Rachel has urged religious leaders to preach peace to their congregations as the country heads to elections. She also urged Kenyans to embrace each other irrespective of their tribal and political affiliations. Speaking at Engineer Stadium in Kinangop, Nyandarua County, on Monday during a peace prayer meeting, Mrs Ruto said the Church has a responsibility to unite Kenyans during the campaign period. “The Church cannot sit back and watch as politicians divide the country. They must be part of the whole process, preaching peace and uniting political leaders and Kenyans. “We want the church to ensure we go to elections a united country like we did in the 2013 general elections,” she said. She said Kenyans should not be divided and should extend kindness to one another. “This country belongs to all of us, we did not decide where we want to be born, a one-day election cannot divide our nation,” she stated. She further said Kenyans should pray to have selfless leaders who care about them. “We want a leader who will not comfortably go to bed not worrying about poor mothers who can’t afford to feed their children, a leader who will spend sleepless nights wondering about children who have no access to good health and education,” she said.

Dear Brenda,I have a problem. My boyfriend is against me going out and having drinks with my friends. He does not take alcohol but I do. How do I convince him that I am just having fun and there is nothing wrong with drinking responsibly?Fun girl The problem between the two of you seems to be a personality clash, you are extroverted and he isn t. It is unfair of him to ask you to give up the whole of that part of your personality. A more reasonable request would be coming to a middle ground. Every once in a while, invite him into your world. Let him come out with you and there will be no trust issues. Also, stay in with him sometimes. The truth is that even the best matched couples have differences in their personalities. Even if you part with this one, you will not find a man who will want to do things exactly the same way as you. email print email print My husband of three years wants to marry his side-chick as his second wife.

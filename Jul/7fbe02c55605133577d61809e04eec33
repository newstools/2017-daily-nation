Jackline Wambui lived up to her billing to end Kenya’s eight-year draught with victory in girls’ 800m in the final day of the World Under-18 Championships on Sunday at Kasarani. Wambui stayed shoulder-to-shoulder with Ethiopian Hirut Meshesha at the bell before bursting with 300m to go pulling along compatriot Lydia Jeruto for a 1-2 victory.       It was a matter of who gets the gold between the Kenyans in the last 200m but its Wambui, the form three student at Riruta Central Secondary School in Nairobi, who claimed victory in 2 minutes and 01.46 seconds powered by a cheering over 55,000 crowd. It was also a world lead in World under-18. Jeruto settled for silver in a Personal Best of 2:02.06 as Meshesha went for bronze in 2:06.32.       It was the first time a Kenyan girl won the two-lap race since Cherono Koech’s victory at the 2009 event in Brixen, Italy in a Championship Record time of 2 minutes and 01.67 seconds. No Kenyan girl had finished on the podium in the last three editions in 2015 Cali, Colombia, 2013 Donetsk, Ukraine and 2011 Lille. "The last 200m is where the race was won," said Wambui. "We took off with ease, having watched the mistakes our 800m boys did." "The cheers from the crowd was a huge motivation," said Jeruto. "I am disappointed I didn’t win gold but happy that my friend Wambui won."   The regional rivals teased each other early on, exchanging the leads.

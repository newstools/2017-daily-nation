There has been an unfortunate development that if not properly handled could degenerate into an all-out trade war between Kenya and Tanzania. This must not be allowed to happen as it would make a mockery of the gallant efforts both countries have put into enhancing regional integration. The East African Community remains the utmost symbol of the fact that the members need to work together for mutual benefit. EAC EXPANSIONThe failure to end a dispute on cooking gas trade between Kenya and Tanzania is a setback in the good work done in the past decade or so to bring the countries closer. After all, the region has a total market population of 120 million and it is of potential benefit. That the EAC is a good thing is evident in its expansion from the initial three countries, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, to incorporate Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. RESOLVE CONFLICTWe do not see why officials cannot speedily deal with disputes that arise. We cannot afford to allow this spat between Kenya and Tanzania to hamper the development of both. There have been other murmurs between the two, which smack of sibling rivalry. These must be quickly ironed out to enhance co-operation and the flow of trade. Perhaps, the heads of State should just breathe some new life into the EAC, which has been rather moribund in the recent past.

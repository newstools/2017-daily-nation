Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary-general Wilson Sossion has come under fire from teachers for allegedly using his position in the union to advance his political interests after claims that he said the teaching fraternity was fully behind Nasa, which is set to nominate him to the Senate through ODM. Knut Kiambu branch chairman Samuel Muiruri, Kiambu East executive secretary Clement Gicharu and his treasurer Rahab Nyambura, during a press conference in Kiambu town on Monday, expressed their anger at Mr Sossion saying he was free to back a political outfit of his choice, but it was wrong to purport it to be the union’s position and to use it to earn political mileage. ENDORSED RE-ELECTION The three said the secretary-general should always place a disclaimer when taking any political position to notify the nation that his stance, which they claimed has earned him the chance to be nominated, is personal. Contrary to Mr Sossion’s political stand, Knut in central region has endorsed the re-election of President Kenyatta. READ: Many trade unionists expected in next Parliament Led by the region’s Knut chairman, Mr Macharia Mwaura, teachers from the region said they would rally behind the Jubilee government. SUPPORT NASA Speaking at Ol Joro Orok town in Nyandarua County, Mr Mwaura said despite various challenges, the country was progressing well. In Murang’a, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria accused Mr Sossion of unlawfully giving Nasa some Sh300 million belonging to teachers. However, Mr Sossion dismissed the MP’s claims, saying he was not in charge of the union’s accounts. Mr Sossion said he had a constitutional right to support Nasa and he owed no one an apology.

Former national volleyball champions Malava Boys High School and Kwanthanze Girls Secondary School will be aiming to reclaim their titles as the Airtel Rising Stars National Secondary Schools Term Two B end at the Moi Nyeri Complex Primary School on Saturday. Malava will play Sengera in the boys’ match as Kwanthanze tackle Cheptil in the girls’ affair. Malava and Kwanthanze both exacted revenge over their bitter rivals in Friday’s semi-finals matches. East Africa champions Malava cruised to a 3-0 (25-22, 25-20, 25-18) victory over national champions Cheptil to end the latter’s reign. Cheptil had beaten Malava in last year’s final in Kisumu. Cheptil, who lost a chance to win their sixth national title, will now battle Kangundo in third place playoffs for the remaining ticket to the East Africa Games set for Gulu, Uganda next month. TASTE GLORY In the other semi-final fixture, two-time national and East Africa champions Kwanthanze beat Soweto in straight sets of 25-16, 25-10 and 28-26 to inch closer to reclaiming the trophy. Following his team’s victory in the semis, Kwanthanze coach Justine Kigwari has tipped his side to taste glory once again. “The disappointment of missing out on last year’s games has seen us work hard to get here and my players want back their crown,” Kigwari said. Kwanthanze will be wary of Cheptil, who beat 23-time champions Lugulu in straight sets of 25-16, 25-20 and 25-17. Cheptil, whose best performance at the nationals has been a second place finish, will be seeking their maiden gong. Lugulu and Soweto will play for the remaining slot to Gulu in third place playoffs.   Upper Hill goalkeeper Duncan Okinyi was the hero for the 2013 champions.

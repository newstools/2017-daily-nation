Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has dismissed as political propaganda reports that he welcomed President Uhuru Kenyatta when he toured the county. Mr Ranguma has accused his ODM rival, Kisumu Senator Anyang' Nyong'o, of resorting to propaganda by linking him to President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party. He accused Prof Nyong'o of dragging his name into Mr Kenyattaâ€™s recent tour of in the region in order to deny him votes in the opposition backyard. "They even used social media to spread photoshopped pictures to drive home their allegations of me welcoming the President at the Kisumu Airport," he said. "Their plot was however thwarted when the Head of State changed his schedule and landed in the neighbouring Homa Bay County before visiting Kisumu," Mr Ranguma added. Mr Ranguma spoke during a meeting with the Seme Council of Elders who endorsed him for a second term. He appealed to residents to re-elect him so that he can finish the projects he started during his first term in office. His endorsement in Prof Nyong'o's Seme Sub-County came just a week after the Kisumu Senator was backed by elders from the expansive Kano clan. The Kisumu governor reiterated that he will marshal support from all the seven sub-counties in Kisumu ahead of the August 8 election. Mr Ranguma quit ODM to vie as an independent candidate following the shambolic party primaries held early this year.

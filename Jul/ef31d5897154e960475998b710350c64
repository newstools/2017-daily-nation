A National Super Alliance (Nasa) political rally in Kabarnet town ended in disarray on Wednesday after its presidential flag-bearer Raila Odinga and his co-principals were heckled. Mr Odinga, accompanied by co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Isaac Ruto, received a hostile reception in the town and had a difficult time addressing the crowd that was chanting Jubilee slogans. Some of the people in the crowd threw Nasa-branded caps to the dais as the leaders addressed them. Police had a difficult time controlling the crowd and shouted down Mr Ruto, the Bomet governor, calling him a traitor. The governor had to cut short his speech after the crowd started chanting pro-Jubilee slogans. Mr Odinga attempted to address the crowd, saying the region was tired of insecurity and urged locals to vote for Nasa. But this was met with hostility as the crowds shouted and dismissed the speakers, saying they were after their own vested interests. The leaders finally abandoned the rally and headed to Eldama Ravine for another meeting. Earlier, Mr Odinga, Mr Mudavadi and Mr Ruto held a rally at Chemolingot trading centre.

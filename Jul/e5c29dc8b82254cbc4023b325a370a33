Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has said Jubilee’s contest against National Super Alliance will be easy victory on August 8. At a rally in Kakamega on Tuesday, the vocal MP who is leading the Jubilee Mbele Iko Sawa caravan said Nasa stood no chance of winning an election because it is headed by a candidate Jubilee has beaten before. “We have come to western to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election and we are confident he will be re-elected on August 8 for another term. “We want to ensure western region is not left out of the next government,” said Mr Kuria. Kakamega is a perceived opposition stronghold but Mr Kuria said if communities in western supported President Kenyatta’s re-election, the region would benefit from development projects. CASH HANDOUTS He spoke at Ikonyero market along the Mumias-Kakamega road. The lawmaker had earlier been expected to join the Jubilee Mbele Iko Sawa caravan in Kakamega Town but did not show up. He was reported to have been attending a meeting at an undisclosed venue. Campaigns by the Jubilee team ran into trouble at one point after youth demanded cash handouts from the party’s aspirants at Shinyalu market. The youth started chanting pro-opposition campaign slogans when the money was not forthcoming. The Jubilee gubernatorial candidate for Kakamega County Mabel Muruli asked the youth to stop engaging in unruly behavior and allow candidates to sell their policies without intimidation. UNFULFILLED PLEDGES “Don’t jeer and heckle because you don’t like what we are telling you. We are here to campaign for President Kenyatta and Jubilee,” said Ms Muruli. She asked voters in Kakamega County to reject Governor Wycliffe Oparanya for failing to fulfill pledges he made in 2013. The Mbele IKo Sawa caravan will head to Vihiga County on Wednesday. Vihiga is Nasa co-principal Musalia Mudavadi’s home turf.

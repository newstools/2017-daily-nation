The Nairobi water distribution company has said moved to reassure consumers about the safety of its water in the wake of a cholera outbreak that has claimed four lives to date. Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) Friday said it is continuously monitoring its water at various sampling points within its distribution network daily. “NCWSC would like to assure our customers that water from our network is safe to drink,” said the company while releasing its latest water rationing schedule.

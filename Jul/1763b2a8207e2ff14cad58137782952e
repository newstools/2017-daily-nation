DÃœSSELDORF As well as the fabled yellow jersey for the overall Tour de France winner, there are a number of other jerseys to be won. Here AFP Sport takes a look at the four jerseys in play: YELLOW JERSEY -The overall winner of the 3,540km, three-week Tour de France will take home the coveted yellow jersey. The overall winner is the rider who completes the total distance in the least time. Briton Chris Froome claimed his third overall success last year, but is still two short of the record held by Eddy Merckx, Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain. GREEEN JERSEY - This one is usually for the sprinters, who claim points both on the finish line and during an intermediate sprint during every stage. The rider with the most points at the end is deemed the best sprinter. Slovak Peter Sagan won for the fifth year in a row last year and is bidding this year to match German Erik Zabel's record of six from 1996-2001. POLKADOT JERSEY - While the overall winner is usually one of the best climbers, there is also a jersey on offer for those specialised in ascents. Points are on offer at the summit of every categorised climb during the Tour, with more points on offer the higher the climb's category. Double points are also awarded when a mountain stage ends with a summit finish. The rider with the most points at the end wins the jersey. Poland's Rafal Majka claimed the mountains jersey for the second time in three years last time around but he has a long way to go to match the record seven wins by Frenchman Richard Virenque. WHITE JERSEY - As well as seeking to discover who is the best rider overall, there is also a competition for the best young rider under 26 years of age. Britain's Adam Yates, who was fourth overall, won the white jersey last year. Several riders have gone on to win the Tour after winning the white jersey, such as Spain's Alberto Contador and Luxembourg's Andy Schleck, who alongside German Jan Ullrich won this jersey a record three times.

Religious leaders from different denominations from across the country are holding prayers for peaceful and credible elections. The meeting, convened by the Multi-Sectoral Forum, brings together the inter-faith communities, the private sector, labour unions and the civil society to dialogue and prepare the country for the elections. “As a culmination of these efforts the religious leaders are calling for a National Prayer Day as we seek God’s guidance and blessings for the nation,” read a message from the leaders. They seek to commit Kenyans to respect the sanctity of human life, uphold personal integrity, decency, moral uprightness, stewardship and accountability, pursue unity, national cohesion and integration, respect other people and their properties, and uphold family values and justice and equity before, during and after the August polls. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES Presidential candidates in the 2017 elections are expected to attend the prayer meeting. The religious leaders are drawn from the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB), the National Council of Churches in Kenya (NCCK), the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslim (Supkem), National Muslim Leaders Forum (Namlef), Hindu Council of Kenya (HCK), Evangelical Alliance of Kenya (EAK), Organisation African Instituted Churches (OAIC), Seventh-day Adventist (SDA), Shia Ithna-Asheri, and the Inter-Religious Council of Kenya (IRCK). They are convening at Ufungamano House in Nairobi. They will be led by Nelson Makanda of NCCK and Sheikh Latiff Shaban of Supkem, with the keynote address being given by former Botswana president Festus Mogae of the Panel of Eminent Persons.

LOS ANGELES The Houston Rockets inked James Harden to a contract extension worth a reported $228 million on Saturday. The Houston Chronicle reported the exact value of the deal, which will keep Harden under contract for six years, will depend on future league-wide salary cap figures. Harden had two years, worth $59 million, left on his previous contract. He benefitted from a provision in the new collective bargaining agreement covering extensions for superstars. He was eligible for the Designated Player Veteran Extension, which for him was worth an additional $169 million over four seasons. "Since he arrived in Houston, James has exhibited the incredible work ethic, desire to win, and passion to be the best that has made him one of the most unique and talented superstars in the history of the game," Rockets owner Leslie Alexander said in a statement announcing the signing. "Additionally, the commitment he has shown to our organization, the City of Houston, and Rockets fans all over the world makes him a perfect leader in our pursuit of another championship." For the second time in three seasons, Harden was second in NBA Most Valuable Player voting, with the award going to Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Harden led the NBA in assists, averaging 11.2 per game. He was second in scoring, averaging 29.1 points. He had career bests in points, assists and rebounds (8.1) for a third straight campaign. He became the only player in NBA history to get at least 2,000 points, 900 assists and 600 rebounds in the same season.

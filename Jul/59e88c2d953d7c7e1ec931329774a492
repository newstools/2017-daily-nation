Dear Just Brenda,I am in a relationship with a managing director of a local company. We are both in our early 50s. We have gone out on dates three times and met sexually twice. I am married and so is the man. Sometimes, this man goes quiet on me for even a month. He likes to share nude photos but I am not for this. Why do you think he goes quiet sometimes? Is it okay for him to do this sometimes?Kindly help! The reason that this man occasionally goes quiet on you is very simple he is a married man! He can t call or text you all the time because there is another woman, another family in the picture.What the two of you have is a clandestine relationship. Clandestine relationships are based on convenience. If you can t wrap your mind around the fact that he will only see you when it s convenient for him, then move along, sister.It would be a great idea to try watering your own lawn, you know, making your own marriage work. The reason the grass seems greener on the other side is that the owners are watering it. Got a problem you want to share with Brenda?

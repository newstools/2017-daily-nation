Mandera County leaders have put the government on the spot over the killings of five people whose bodies were found in a shallow grave in Fino. The leaders, including MPs and officials of the Economic Freedom Party, urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and have the deaths investigated. They pointed an accusing finger at the police, who they alleged are targeting innocent and unarmed civilians. MPs Abdulaziz Farah (Mandera East) and Osman Hassan (nominated), and Mandera County governorship aspirant Hassan Noor Hassan, spoke at Wilson Airport in Nairobi on arrival from Mandera after herders in Fino discovered five bodies. The four young men and a woman were allegedly murdered and secretly buried in a shallow grave. “The operation in the area five days ago saw twelve locals arrested and taken to the police camp, where they were questioned and told to produce those behind the menace of improvised explosive devices that have claimed the lives of police officers,” claimed the Mandera East MP. “Seven were later released but five were detained. The five were never seen again until their bodies were discovered by herders as they grazed their animals. We demand that the government produce the killers,” said the MP The leaders were also united in urging the government to call off the ongoing police operation in the county. Mr Noor blamed the police for the deaths, saying that officers are only interested in torturing people and not enhancing security in the area. “What has happened is so sad for the people of Mandera. We cannot accept security agencies to turn their guns on residents,” he said. According to the leaders, the heavy presence of security personnel, including the military, had done little to prevent Al-Shabaab activities.

Jubilee Claim and War Horse shared commentary limelight in the Nairobi Town Plate, but, after an automated flash of wisdom, Charles Njenga managed to charm Jubilee Claim for deeper digging, when it mattered. Trainers, Patsy Sercombe and Onesmus Mutua, expanded their library of winners by four a piece, until Joe Muya/Steve Njuguna intervened.Faster than a proton in an accelerating particle, Hawker Fury (Heni Greyling), shook his neighbour, Notorious, to crackle the Jockey Club Stakes. Imagine how disappointed punters were, when they heard Western Ballad was withdrawn under Veterinary Certificate. Now we will never know if she could have fixated Hawker Fury.NGONG RESULTS12.10 pm - First Race - Liki Handicap (1,200m)1. Niagara Mist (Richard Kibet)2. Romeo Foxtrot (Heni Greyling)3.

Kenya Pipeline Company could make a promotional tariff permanent after realising a 20 per cent increase in fuel exports to eastern Africa. Managing director Joe Sang said the tariff had seen more oil transporters patronise KPC depots. The tariff, introduced last April, is applicable to oil marketers accessing oil for export through Kisumu and Eldoret depots and levies Sh4,238 ($41.55) down from the Sh6,050 ($59.32). Mr Sang said increased use of the two depots had shortened the distance travelled by trucks on Kenyan highways. “The company will be reviewing the tariff in the next few weeks with a view to determining if we can make it permanent,” he said. He said KPC’s commissioning of Sinendet-Kisumu parallel pipeline was an assurance to western Kenya of adequate stocks. “This 122 km 10-inch diameter pipeline runs parallel to another six-inch diameter pipeline from Sinendet to Kisumu which has enhanced petroleum product availability in western Kenya and the export market of Uganda, Eastern DRC, Rwanda, Burundi and Northern Tanzania, ” he said.

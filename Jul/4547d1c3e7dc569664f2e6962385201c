Kisumu Senator Anyang’ Nyong’o unveiled his manifesto promising to turn around the economy if elected governor. Dubbed 'The Mission is Possible', the ODM candidate vowed to establish a functioning city management board and appoint an ethical manager to run it effectively. "This will facilitate a 24-hour economy in a city that is environmentally habitable," the Senator said at Grand Swiss Hotel on Friday. "Likewise in the villages, devolution will have its foundation in the five-member village councils and a village administrator." CORRUPTION Prof Nyong'o said the village councils will be involved in planning of development agendas through participation. "These institutions are critical for the formulation and implementation of the County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP)," he said. He said he will also tackle corruption, which has been facilitated by poor governance. KEY SECTORS His running mate, Dr Mathews Owili, said their government will launch a forensic audit to recover stolen funds. "There is a lot of pilferage of county funds to individual pockets. We will ensure those culpable are held accountable," Dr Owili said. Other issues the manifesto focuses on are agriculture, food security, housing, water and energy. COMPETENT LEADER Also present at the launch was Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga who said the county is on the path of restoring its lost glory; and the senator is the right leader for the task. "We have never seen anything like a manifesto in this county. This is the first launch and we are proud of it," she said. Others in attendance were Nyando MP Fred Outa, who is eying the senatorial seat on an ODM ticket, and Seme MP James Nyikal, among others.

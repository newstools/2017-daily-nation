Safaricom #ticker:SCOM has returned to court seeking clarification on an injunction that barred it from remitting artistes’ Skiza Tunes royalties to Collective Management Organisations (CMOs). The telecommunications company says the November 2016 orders issued by Justice Said Chitembwe only affect artistes Mercy King’oo and Nyiva Kingai who are the petitioners in the case between Safaricom and CMOs. Through lawyer Billy Kongere, Safaricom argues that the orders affect artistes who are not parties in the petition and wish to be paid through the CMOs.

Earlier, Safaricom used to pay the Skiza Tune royalties to CMOs, Music Copyright Society of Kenya, Performers Rights Society of Kenya and Kenya Association of Music Producers.

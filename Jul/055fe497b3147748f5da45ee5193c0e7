Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko has denied claims that water supplied by the Sonko Rescue Team is contaminated and contributing to the spread of cholera in the city. Speaking to the Nation by phone on Wednesday, the Senator said those claiming that the water supplied by his team is not clean are out to discredit the project for political gain. “I have been supplying this water for the last five years and there have been no cases of cholera or any other waterborne diseases. Why make the claims now when we are campaigning?” posed Mr Sonko, who is the Jubilee candidate for Nairobi governorship. “Our water is clean and we get them from boreholes that have been inspected and certified by water authorities. Besides, we take the extra precaution to clean the water before we supply them. We are open to inspection,” he said. HYGIENE His remarks comes after Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero questioned the hygienic conditions of the water being supplied by water bowsers belonging to the senator. The governor also banned water vendors who are not registered by the county or Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company claiming that they were contributing to the spread of the deadly disease. Mr Peter Kenneth, who is also eying the Nairobi governor’s seat blamed Dr Kidero for failing to contain the spread of the disease. “It is a shame, a pity that somebody can preside over a big city and allow a hygiene issue to develop into a full blown cholera outbreak,” said Mr Kenneth while speaking at Jesus is the Healer Church in Mail-Saba, Nairobi. He claimed that the cholera cases being reported in the county emanated from poor hygiene and sanitation services in the county. “You have also seen water, sewage and drainage lines are all connected whereas there should have been clear demarcation. The inspection services at the county government is wanting and in a very bad condition,” he said.

The IAAF World Under-18 Championships caravan made a triumphant entry in Nakuru County on Friday.Nakuru County Deputy Governor Joseph Ruto flagged off the caravan and urged the residents of Nakuru to attend the event next week as it will be the last edition.He called on the management of schools in the region to organise for pupils and students to attend as they will be admitted free of charge. I urge the youth to make sure they attend the World Under-18 Championships because they will have a lot to learn and also cheer up the local boys and girls as they win medals for Kenya, said Ruto.Ruto said that Nakuru County was proud to have produced Faith Chepng'etich, who won 1,500m gold for Kenya at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in Brazil. We want to produce more Faith Chepng'etichs because this county has what it takes to produce such award winning athletes and that is why as a county we shall continue to invest in nurturing new sporting talents, said Ruto. He congratulated the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta for spearheading the preparations of the event to ensure that it was held successfully. By hosting more than 150 countries in Kenya this is a mark that the country is still a powerhouse in athletics. I urge Kenyans to turn out in large numbers to cheer the home boys and girls, added Ruto.The caravan will head to Nyandarua and Nyeri before returning to Nairobi ahead of the official opening of the championships at Moi International Sports Centre.The caravan has so far toured Elgeyo- Marakwet, Kericho, Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Nyamira and Kisii counties. email print email print The school girl hopes to make it to the World Under-20 Championships next year.

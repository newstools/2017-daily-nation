African Games 400m silver medallist Boniface Mweresa is the latest inclusion in Team Kenya for the World Championships due August 4-13 in London.Mweresa, who won men s 400m final during the Uganda World Championships trials in 45.42 seconds on Wednesday, will be making his second appearance at the Worlds.Mweresa, who was in the 2013 4x400m Relay team that was disqualified, now joins Collins Omae and Raymond Kibet in the one lap team for the London competition.That effectively looks out Alphas Kishoyian, who had earlier been named in the team but had not attained the World Championships qualifying time of 45.50 seconds.More so, efforts to have Kenya given a wild card in men s 4x400m relays has also proved futile thus sealing Kishoyian s fate. Kishoyian has represented Kenya in the last two World Championships in 2013 Moscow and 2015 Beijing where he lost in the heats.Haron Koech also joins his the brother the World 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett in the 400m hurdles team, having clocked 49.39 in a local race in Modova, Italy last Sunday.Koech, Bett and Kiprono Kosgei were named during the trials and while Bett qualified by virtue of being the defending champion, Koech and Kosgei were given a grace period to try and qualify. The qualifying deadline is at midnight on July 31. Hard work and persistence pays and I am excited to make it to London, said Mweresa, who finished fifth in 400m during the 2016 World Indoor Championships in Eugene, USA. email print email print Coach Julius Kirwa is a worried man.

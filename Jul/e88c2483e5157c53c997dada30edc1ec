Nairobi governor Evans Kidero, his Kisumu counterpart Jack Ranguma and Environment Secretary Alice Kaudia have lost their bid to stop a suit seeking to bar them from building plush residential homes on the shores of Lake Victoria. Kisumu High Court Judge Stephen Kibunja dismissed objections by the trio, who had challenged activist Michael Otieno Nyagutiâ€™s right to sue them over the developments. Dr Kidero, Mr Ranguma and Dr Kaudia are each in the process of building personal residential homes on the shores of the lake. However, Justice Kibunja ruled that Mr Nyaguti had the right to obtain information on whether the National Environmental Authority (Nema) approved the developments as it is material held by the State, hence is public. In his suit, Mr Nyaguti says the constructions will negatively affect the wetland area and wants all the developments stopped. Justice Kibunja further ordered officials of the Kisumu Land registry to visit the sites and file a report on the developments within 90 days.

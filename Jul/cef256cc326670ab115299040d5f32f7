Political leaders in Mandera have accused security agencies of abducting and killing locals after five bodies were discovered in a shallow grave on Monday. Deputy Governor Omar Maalim, in his address at the formal burial of the five, said the government was aware of the high rate of mysterious deaths and played a role in them. “The government of the day is part and parcel of the many deaths happening in Mandera because those killed are first held in different police stations before their bodies are stumbled upon,” he said.

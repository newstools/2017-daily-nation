President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto will on Saturday hold a mega rally at Kapkatet Stadium in Bureti, Kericho County. With less than 10 days to the August 8 General Election, the Jubilee leaders will be seeking to consolidate its South Rift support base. The event, deemed as the last in the region before voting day, will bring together all Jubilee aspirants from the county. Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony, who is also the South Rift campaign chairman for Jubilee said all is set for the rally and asked locals to turn up in large numbers. The governor, who held several roadshows to popularise the rally said they would assure the president Kenyatta and his deputy of the region's support and exuded confidence that Jubilee will win the August 8 polls by a big margin. “The Jubilee administration has done a lot in terms of development and this has endeared themselves to the voters. I want to state clearly that Jubilee coalition is far ahead of Nasa in the presidential race,” said Chepkwony, who is defending his seat on Jubilee ticket. The Head of State's expected visit has built expectations of more goodies by locals. In the long list of expectations is waivers of debts owed by tea, coffee and sugarcane farmers and delay in mega projects including water, a referral hospital and Kabianga University, Kapkatet campus. The Jubilee leaders will afterwards head to Suswa grounds in Narok for another rally.

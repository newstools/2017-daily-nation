President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to reject attempts by self-centred politicians to create hatred and ethnic tensions to win power ahead of the August 8 elections. The President said Kenyans should campaign and vote in peace without fear of any violence during or after the elections. Speaking Tuesday in Kangema, Murang’a County, President Kenyatta said Kenyans should reject politicians who have made it a habit to incite Kenyans against each other. It was the fifth stop on the first day of a 12-day campaign offensive that will take him to 30 counties. Mr Kenyatta urged his supporters to come out in large numbers and vote to give him another term to finish the work he has started. He said his administration has laid down the foundation for progress and wants to implement his action plan to create more jobs and lower prices of goods. LIVE ANYWHERE The President said every Kenyan has the right to live and work anywhere within the country without fear. “We want Kenyans to live in peace. Let us vote in peace. We in Jubilee have no fight with anyone,” said the President. President Kenyatta also took a swipe at Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga, accusing him of fanning ethnic divisions. He said Mr Odinga cannot run away from the fact that he was caught red-handed inciting communities in Kajiado and promising to punish some communities if he becomes president. “However much he denies, we have the evidence of him saying that he will forcefully move some communities from Kajiado County. We have the videos,” said the President. The President addressed rallies in Mukurweini, Tetu, Othaya and Kangema constituencies.   Deputy President tells ODM presidential candidate Raila Odinga to stop 'intimidating' military.

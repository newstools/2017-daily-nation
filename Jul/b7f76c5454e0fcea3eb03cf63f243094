Taita Taveta Governor John Mruttu's re-election bid got a major boost after more than 2,000 youths across the county backed his candidature. The youths from Wundanyi, Voi, Mwatate and Taveta endorsed Governor Mruttu, saying he had delivered on his campaign pledges and that he is committed to improving residents' welfare. "Our governor deserves a second term to continue with his development projects. "At least he has shown commitment to better [the] lives of the electorate," Mr Joseph Mwadime, a youth leader from Mwatate, said. LEADERS WITH VIRTUES Speaking on Friday in a meeting with the youth in Taveta town, Mr Mruttu called on the residents to reject leaders riding on insults and propaganda to gain political mileage. He said they should not allow leaders to drive a wedge among them for the sake of winning in the elections. "Embrace leaders who approach you with solid and pragmatic transformation agenda and those whose ideologies are based on improving your living standards," he said. ODM PRIMARIES Mr Mruttu is defending his seat as an independent candidate after dumping ODM after a disputed nomination in which Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu won.

COMPETITORS "My opponents are many and you have seen them running up and down trying to taint my name, next time ask them what their plans for the county are," he said. "They should know that their continued attacks and insults will not improve lives of the residents in anyway." Other rivals are Granton Samboja (Wiper), Ms Jacinta Mwatela (Amani National Congress), Dr Constantine Mwadime (Maendeleo Chap Chap) and independent candidates Erastus Katani and Emmanuel Kisombe.

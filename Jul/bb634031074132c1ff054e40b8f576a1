Emmaculate Chepkirui won Kenya its first medal in the ongoing World Under-18 Championships after bagging silver in the girls’ 3,000m on Wednesday at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Ethiopia’s Abersh Minsewo stunned Chepkirui after the two athletes engaged in a shoulder-to-shoulder battle before the Ethiopian carried the day at the last 10 metres in 9 minutes and 24.0.       Chepkirui came in second place in 9:24.69 with another Ethiopian Yatiyish Mekonene, beating Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet to bronze in 9:28.46. Chebet came home in 9:33.26 at the rain-soaked Kasarani track. “I knew the Ethiopians are tough with a superb finishing kick but the rains seem to have messed up my plans to break Mercy Cherono’s record,” said Chepkirui. “I am going to train hard for next year’s World Under-20 where I intend to go one better this time round,” added Chepkirui, the World Under-20 5,000m silver medallist. Cherono won the 3,000m race during the 2007 Ostrava Championships in a Championship Record time of 8:53.94. Chepkirui’s efforts to join the likes of Cherono, Lilian Kasait, Purity Rionoripo and Veronica Nyaruai, who have won the world youth title, proved a cropper under the wet conditions occasioned by a heavy downpour. A dejected Chebet said that she would continue to train ahead of other events. “I want to give the World Under-20 Championships next year a shot,” said Chebet.   The final will be held on Friday.

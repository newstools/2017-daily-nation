Two other people have been charged in a Mombasa court with illegally selling Madaraka Express train tickets without authority from Kenya Railways Corporation. This brings to seven the number of suspects so far arrested by police and charged in court with the offence. Stephen Maina Muchiri and Millicent Annet Auma appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate Edgah Kagoni. The offence was allegedly committed on July 17 at the Miritini terminal in Changamwe in Mombasa County. They were released on Sh10,000 cash bail. Five suspects — Hilder Wanjala, Maurine Gatwiri, Richard Githinji, Jimmi Muriungi and Jabes Ochieng — were charged on Monday.

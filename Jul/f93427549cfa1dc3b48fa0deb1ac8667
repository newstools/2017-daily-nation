Prolific Jamaican reggae and dancehall superstar, Busy Signal will be performing live this Saturday at the 33rd Shashamane International Anniversary at KICC Grounds, Nairobi. The show is dubbed Free Up Peace Reggae Concert, perhaps named after the 38-year-old’s popular jam “Free up Black People”. He will grace the stage barely a week after his counterpart Wizkid rocked Nairobi on the same stage. Kenya’s dancehall king Wyre, Vivian and gospel sensation Mr Seed will curtain raise for the star. Busy Signal is excited to come to Kenya. Check one of his Instagram posts: “Kenya, the wait is over. It’s happening on Saturday 29th July 2017 at the KICC Grounds. I am so excited to come to Kenya.” Advance tickets for the “Bedroom Bully” singer concert go for Sh4,500 for VVIP, Sh 3,000 for V.I.P and Ksh1,000 for the regular. Prices for tickets purchased at the gate go up by Sh500. This will be the second time that Busy Signal will be performing in Kenya since April 2011 when he brought curtains down at the Swaggerific concert. The singer, who is also a Deejay, started his musical career 17 years ago back in 2000 but got International recognition five years later when he released several successful hits that included “Come Over”, “NightShift”, ‘”One more Night”,  “Bedroom Bully” among others.

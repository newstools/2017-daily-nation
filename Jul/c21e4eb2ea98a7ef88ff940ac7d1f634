Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has ordered education officers to carry out inspection of schools three times a week. Dr Matiang’i said the strict measure targeting basic education institutions will help the government to assess the quality of teaching and learning and the pupils’ welfare. Speaking in Kajiado County after officially opening the Amboseli International School, he said inspections must not just focus on how children receive learning instructions.

WRITE REPORTS Quality Assurance and Standards Officers will now spend three days in the field inspecting schools within their jurisdictions and only two days in their offices. They will then be required to write a report on their observations, including recommendations. Dr Matiang’i also stressed the need for schools offering the international curriculum to ensure that their students study the history of Kenya and also Kiswahili up to Grade 9, which is the equivalent of Form Two under the 8-4-4 system of education.

Hi,I was in a relationship with a girl whom I loved, and still love, very much. We went to the same secondary school, where our relationship began in 2014. The problem is that she never calls or texts me; I am the one who always calls her. I can say that since I met her three years ago, I have not met a girl like her.What annoyed me is that she came to Mombasa, where I live, and went to the beach but she did not inform me that she was coming. I learnt about it through a photo of herself on the beach which she posted on Facebook. I want you help me because I am finding it difficult to forget her because I still love her. Hi,I am not sure what your definition of a relationship is. However, It is well known that your understanding of what makes a relationship affects what you invest in it. What I see in your case is lack of a clear definition of a relationship. It seems to mean one thing to you, but quite another to your partner. Does she really see things the way you do?Her failure to inform you that she was in Mombasa could have been an indication of her lack of interest in the relationship. I suggest that you redefine what having a relationship means. This is the first thing that will help you know what you are looking for in a woman. Second, if this woman has moved on and decided not to communicate with you, I suggest that you let her be. Her actions already say a lot about her feelings towards you. I suggest that you face the facts at hand. email print email print

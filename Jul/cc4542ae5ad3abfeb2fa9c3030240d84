Research firm Infotrak will today release opinion polls for Embu, Migori, Bungoma, Turkana and Nyandarua counties. The survey will show the most popular candidates for the seats of governor, woman representative and senator, 11 days to the election. “While opinion leaders, politicians and other relevant elections stakeholders share their views on what they think about who is likely to carry the day, it is truly the Voice of the Kenyan voters that matters,” the firm said in a statement. In Turkana, the race is between Senator John Munyes of Jubilee and incumbent Governor Josphat Nanok. In Embu, the incumbent Martin Wambora will face off with Senator Lenny Kivuti of Maendeleo Chap Chap and PNU’s Kithinji Kiragu. Also in the race are Narc Kenya’s Leonard Muriuki, Dr Njagi Kumantha of DP and former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru (independent). Mr Kiragu emerged second after Mr Wambora in the 2013 polls. Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka of Jubilee will face Wycliffe Wangamati (Ford-Kenya), Alfred Khang’ati (ODM) and Stephen Mutoro (ANC). The fifth, Mr Jim Nduruchi, is an independent candidate. Former Secretary to the Cabinet Francis Kimemia of Jubilee Party, Dr Kiarie Ndirangu (independent) and Maendeleo Chap Chap’s Kanja Muchina are competing for the Nyandarua governor seat.

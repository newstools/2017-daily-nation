African leaders will gather in Addis Ababa on Monday to discuss a critical part of the population — youth. The African Union meeting, under the theme, ‘Harnessing the demographic dividend through investments in youth’, hopes to come up with ways of putting more resources in young people, who form the bulk of the African population, to get them more integrated into the society, economically, socially and culturally. This promises to be a critical summit because a majority of young people across the continent are reasonably well-educated, but only a small fraction make any meaningful contribution because of unemployment and lack of support to start their own enterprises. GOVERNANCE AND EMPOWERMENT We hope the meeting will tackle issues such as employment and entrepreneurship, education and skills development, health, governance and empowerment. However, the AU is notorious for its inability to follow up on its declarations with implementation. Most of its meetings are mere talking shops where leaders just gather to wine and dine while the decisions made are consigned to the archives. If the AU must remain respectable, then it must strive to ensure that its decisions are translated into tangible results that improve lives.

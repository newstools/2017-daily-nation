The national cricket team’s qualification for the 2018 Under-19 World Cup is a clear indication that the revival of the game is possible. The team had failed to qualify for the World Cup in seven consecutive tournaments between 2004 and 2016. But this time, the boys coached by former international Jimmy Kamande, won the top spot in 2017 ICC Under-19 World Cup Africa Qualifier at the Nairobi Gymkhana. They have qualified at a time when the senior national team has been performing poorly, having failed to qualify for the 2015 World Cup, missing out for the first time since the 1996. SEMI-FINALS This has seen Kenya, who reached the 2003 World Cup semi-finals, being bypassed, as Bangladesh was awarded full ICC Test Status in 2000 followed by Ireland and Afghanistan, a fortnight ago. The Under-19 team’s success comes with pertinent lessons for Kenya, as the growth of cricket in Afghanistan has been particularly astonishing, given that most members of the current team learned to play while growing up in refugee camps. War-ravaged Afghanistan has invested considerably in infrastructure and development programmes. Bangladesh has also invested heavily in youth programmes that have seen its game grow. Cricket Kenya ought to change tack by setting up the right structures for development with viable national leagues within various age groups.

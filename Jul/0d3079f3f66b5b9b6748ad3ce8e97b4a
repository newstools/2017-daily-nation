I was putting so badly and dropped all those shots because of three putting though I managed to improve at the back nine, said Karichu. He birdied the 15th, 16th and 18th for the day s two over par 74 and a total of one over par 217 to win his third Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC) series event.

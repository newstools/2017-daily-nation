Kenya’s representatives in the girls 800m in the World Under 18 Championships lit up the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasaran on Friday evening with commanding performances to storm into the final of the event. Riruta Central Secondary School’s Jackline Wambui and Lydia Jeruto tore their fields apart to the delight of the crowd at Kasarani.   Jeruto, a seven pupil at Poror Primary School in Eldama Ravine, led from the start to finish, cruising past the 400m in 1:05.55 and 600m in 1:39.46 before winning the first semi-final in 2:10.48. Jeruto edged out Milena Korbut to second place in 2:11.31 as Lena Kieffer from Luxemburg settled third in 2:11.95 to qualify.   A calm Wambui, a form three student at Riruta Central, took control of the second semi-final teasing her rivals as she zoomed past 400m and 600m in 1:08.95 and 1:43.10 respectively before claiming victory in 2:14.18. Wambui edged out Ethiopian Hirut Meshesha and Moroccan Chaimas Ismaili to second and third places in 1:14.45 and 1:14.80 respectively.   The triumphant Wambui and Jeruto vowed to end Kenya’s eight-year drought over the two-lap race at the World Youth event. “It was a largely comfortable race and the fans were amazing,” said Jeruto. “The huge task now is to finish this off on Sunday and I believe we can.” “I am glad we all went through to the final and what is remaining now is to strategise how we shall claim a 1-2 finish,” said the 17-year-old Wambui. Cherono Koech is the last Kenyan to win the 800m at the world youth competition at the 2009 Championships in Brixen, Italy in a Championship Record time of 2:01.67.

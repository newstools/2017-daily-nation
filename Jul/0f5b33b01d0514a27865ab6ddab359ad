A small news item piqued my interest this week.According to a report filed by the Kenya News Agency, the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) has partnered with the Kisumu Youth Football Association to offer local coaches a five day practical and plenary training with an aim of improving the quality of local football.Quoting Piet DeJong, an instructor from KNVB the news piece had it that football had become competitive across the globe and it was necessary to train coaches with the necessary skills that will help them to be tactful in dealing with the dynamics of the game. Today football is not just about talent like it used to be, it now involves proper training, mentorship, motivation and investment. By training coaches, we lay a foundation upon which young players will benefit during their own interactions with the trained coaches, said DeJong.The instructor, who has also been in Ghana and Mozambique, observed that Kenya has got talent and it was necessary to tap it early enough adding that the Dutch have invested in football and will extend the same in Kenya.On his part Kisumu Youth Football Association manager Kevin Obware said that he was impressed that Kisumu had been identified as one of the training centres at the time they were preparing a team to participate in the Kenya Premier League by 2020.Obware added that they were taking the training seriously and coaches would be submitting monthly reports to the Association on the progress and response of players to the new skills and tactics imparted.Practical sessions have been taking place at the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Grounds with local players drawn from Kisumu s informal settlements of Manyatta, Kondele and Mamboleo being used in offering practical and technical skills to the coaches.The training will also be carried out in Kitale, Migori, Nairobi, Kilifi and Mombasa. This story impressed me because from where I sit, this is the way to go if we have to improve our football.Many would remember the youth centres of the 1970s which ended up churning some of the finest players our country has ever seen. Then there were the upcountry teams like Kisumu Hotstars and Motcom of Kakamega which ended up being the feeder clubs for the giants like Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards respectively.My humble appeal to those in charge of our football is to explore ways of deepening this partnership and take it to as many parts of the country as possible. This way we would be in a position to tap the huge potential we have in Kenya. email print email print

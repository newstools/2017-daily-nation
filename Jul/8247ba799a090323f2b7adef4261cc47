More than 200 acres of maize, wheat and potato seedlings at Asante Agricultural Development Corporation farm in Molo, Nakuru were destroyed by a hailstorm on Tuesday. According to the regional ADC manager Paul Njuguna, at least 120 acres of wheat, 50 acres of maize and 30 acres of potato seeds were destroyed. Mr Njuguna said the destruction is estimated about Sh14 million. “It will disrupt the planting season and may have a negative impact on food production,” he said. CLIMATE CHANGE He attributed the unexpected hailstorm to climate change patterns aggravated by a depleted forest cover and human invasion on restricted ecosystem areas. The seedlings were earmarked to be distributed to farmers for the planting season between September and December. Another ADC farm in Sirikwa suffered the same fate. And, in Laikipia, residents were on Tuesday evening treated to a rare spectacle of hailstones following a heavy downpour. Limunga, Sironi and Maili Saba in Laikipia West were the most affected. The Nyahururu-Rumuruti-Maralal road was also affected. Residents and motorists had a field day taking pictures of the hailstones, which many mistook for snow, and uploaded them on social media. At the same time, several farmers were left counting losses occasioned by the heavy downpour.

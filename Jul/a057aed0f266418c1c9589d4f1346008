A car in Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s campaign convoy has hit and injured a man in Jomvu. The man in an ODM T-shirt was among Mr Joho's supporters who had come out during the governor’s door-to-door vote hunt. VOTE CHASE The ODM deputy party leader is seeking to defend his seat against Hassan Omar of Wiper, Suleiman Shahbal of Jubilee and Hezron Awiti of Vibrant Democratic Party. Following the incident at Bangladesh bridge on Tuesday evening, Mr Joho cut short his vote chase and asked that the casualty be attended to. "We cannot proceed. I am told one of our supporters has been hit by a car. Let us go and see if he is seriously injured and help him," he said. The casualty was carried by other supporters and taken to a nearby hospital. Mr Joho then continued with his campaign to Mikindani. It was not immediately clear who the owner of the vehicle is. RAILA The incident happened after Mr Joho addressed residents of the Bangladesh slums, where he urged them to elect Raila Odinga in the August polls. Mr Joho asked Mr Odinga "to come and campaign for only two days here in Mombasa because people from this county have made their choice, which is Nasa". He said he was confident he would be voted in for the second term and urged residents to send Jubilee home. "We are competing with Jubilee and its brokers, who have been sent to Nasa to fight us from within. We are telling them we are ready," he said.

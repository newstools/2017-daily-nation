WELLINGTONAll Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams was sent off for a shoulder-charge in the first half of the second Test against the British and Irish Lions on Saturday.Williams' shoulder crunched into the head of Lions winger Anthony Watson, prompting French referee Jerome Garces to show him the red card on 25 minutes after consulting the TV match official.It forced the 14-man All Blacks to sacrifice blindside flanker Jerome Kaino, who was replaced by debutant Ngani Laumape to maintain numbers in the backline.The Lions lost the opening Test 30-15 last week in Auckland, meaning they must win in Wellington to keep the three-match series alive. email print email print

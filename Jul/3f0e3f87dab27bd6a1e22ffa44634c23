Kenya's George Manangoi is the 1500m World Under 18 Championships gold medallist. Manangoi made history as the first Kenyan to win at the first world major event staged in the country when he glided past Ethiopian rivals with 200m to go to win boys’ 1,500m final at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Lying fourth at the bell, Manangoi tactically trailed his rivals before he started to charge with 300m to go. Manangoi, the younger brother of World 1,500m silver medallist Elijah Manangoi, then moved to the outer lane to overtake before overtaking the Ethiopian duo of Abene Dessassa and Belete Mekonen, and Algerian Oussana Cherrad to win in 3 minutes and 47.53 seconds. It was heart-breaking for Algerian Cherrad, who was disqualified for obstruction under rule 163.2(b) as Dessassa was upgraded to silver with compatriot Mekonen (3:50.64) winning bronze. The two Ethiopians and Cherrad led through 1200m in 3:08.00 before the tactical Manangoi started to charge with 300m to go. The Kenyan took charge with 200m to go to win. KIPKEMBOI OUT Kenya's other medal prospect Dominic Kipkemboi failed to start the race with an injury, ruining the hopes of a 1-2 for the home nation. “It was such an amazing moment and a great feeling winning a world title at home. It’s equally humbling that I am the first Kenyan to win a world title at home,” said Manangoi, who is handled by Ben Ouma from Rongai Athletics Club. Manangoi paid tribute to compatriot Kipkemboi, who didn’t start after failing to recover on time after he got injured during the semi-final on Wednesday. “I did it for Kipkemboi since I am sure we could have swept the top two places.” Manangoi also paid tribute to his elder brother Elijah for having mentored him and World 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop for inspiration. “I have learnt a lot from them and I hope I have started it well for them ahead of London World Championships,” said Manangoi.     Kenya has only lost the 1,500m twice since the inaugural 1999 Championships in Poland where Cornelius Chirchir and Michael Too staged a 1-2 sweep over the metric mile race. Chirchir went on to win the title at the 2000 World Under-20 Championships in Chile. Two-time World Athletics Final bronze medallist Isaac Songok won the 2001 World Under-18 1,500m in Hungary in a CR of 3:36.78 while Benson Marrianyi and Samson Kiplangat went for a 1-2 feat at the 2003 Championships in Canada. Kenya missed the title at the 2005 Championships in Morocco when Belal Mansoor Ali from Bahrain reigned but Fredrick Ndunge Musyoki reclaimed the crown for Kenya, guiding Josphat Kithii Mitunga to a 1-2 victory at the 2007 competition in Czech. Kenya registered its fourth 1-2 finish at 2009 Championships in Italy with Gideon Kiage Mageka and Caleb Mwangangi, the current World 5,000m silver medallist, claiming the honour. Kenya lost the title for the second and last time at the 2011 event in France where Ethiopian Teshome Dirirsa beat Vincent Kiprotich and Jonathan Sawe to gold. Kenya was back in business when Robert Kiptoo Biwott won during the 2013 competition held in Donetsk, Ukraine before Kumari Taki crushed Songok’s CR in 2015 Cali, Colombia. Taki went on to win the World Undre-20 1,500m title last year in Poland.   Kenya have won six out of the six editions of the world youth.

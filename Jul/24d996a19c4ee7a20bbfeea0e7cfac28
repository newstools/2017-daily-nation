There has been hardly any good news on the national food security front and it could get worse. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett is warning that the annual maize yield is likely to drop by between 20 and 25 per cent this year due to a fall armyworm invasion in the major crop growing zones. This is only going to complicate matters, as an acute maize flour shortage has forced the government to go for imports. Indeed, the first consignment seems to have had little impact on the shortfall, with consumers complaining that they have not got any of the subsidised maize flour. INADEQUATE SUPPLY Consumers would only be too happy to buy the two-kilogramme packet at the government price of Sh90, but the supply has been inadequate. This has forced the authorities to import more, but the armyworm invasion means that the anticipated boost from this yearâ€™s harvest might not materialise. Even more worrying is the news that the pests have now spread beyond the western region to the coast. FOOD SECURITY This is going to further undermine food security and force the government to seek more resources to stave off hunger and starvation. Forewarned is forearmed. A donation of pesticides worth Sh10 million is laudable. However, more needs to be done to fight the pest by creating awareness and educating farmers on what to do.

Former GOtv Shield champions Gor Mahia and last year’s runners up Ulinzi Stars will take no further part in the tournament’s round of 16 matches set for July 22 -23. Gor were tossed out of the domestic cup on Sunday following a 6-5 penalty loss to fellow SportPesa Premier League side Bandari, while last year’s runners-up Ulinzi fell 1-0 to Sony Sugar at home to tumble out of the competition. “The last time we played Ulinzi, we drew 1-1 so we were confident on Saturday. We knew that Ulinzi are good defensively so we went all out on attack and that worked for us,” Sony coach Salim Babu said. Tusker remain firm favourites to retain the trophy after beating Palos 1-0 in Meru last weekend. Former champions AFC Leopards are also in the running for the year’s trophy, and face lower-tier side Bidco in the round of 16.

Kenya acquitted itself well by hosting the recent IAAF World U18 Championships last week. It demonstrated the ability to organise and manage major international sporting contests. But now the focus shifts to the 2018 African Nations Championship. Kenya will host the event from January 11 to February 2 next year. However, questions abound over the country’s readiness for the bonanza. Four stadiums have been identified to host the event – Safaricom and Nyayo in Nairobi, Kenyatta in Machakos and Kinoru in Embu. Apart for Safaricom and Kinoru, the rest are in poor shape. REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE Sports Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia has assured that they will put in place all the required infrastructure before January. But no work has started so far. The Confederation of Africa Football’s inspection team will be in the country on August 28. The team was last here in June and was not impressed. It will be embarrassing if the country fails to host the championships, considering the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations was taken away from Kenya and given to South Africa. The government must move with haste to rehabilitate the stadiums.

Tusker coach George Nsimbe is the Fidelity Insurance Kenyan Premier League Coach of the Month for May.The Ugandan was voted unanimously by a panel of sports after leading the brewers unbeaten in the month of May where they won all the five matches.The league champions registered wins against Kakamega Homeboyz (1-0), Zoo Kericho (2-0), Sony Sugar (2-1) and Mathare United (2-0) before ending the month with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over AFC Leopards at Kinoru Stadium on May 28.The Ugandan became only the third tactician to receive the award this year after former Gor Mahia coach Marcelo 'Ze Maria' Ferreira and Posta Rangers Sammy Pamzo Omollo - who won the March and April accolades respectively. This earned him a cash prize of Sh75,000 and a trophy from Fidelity Insurance, who sponsor the awards through the Sports Journalists Association of Kenya.The soft-spoken Nsimbe thanked his players for their splendid efforts throughout the season. It makes me proud to be a recipient of this award. The league is very competitive and it is not easy to put together the kind of record that we now have," said Nsimbe."This award is for the players because without them I would have been worthy of receiving it. They have worked very hard especially since we had a bad start to the season, and I thank them for their tireless efforts and determination, he said at the team s Ruaraka grounds. Nsimbe assumed coaching duties at Tusker at the beginning of this year, replacing his fellow Ugandan counterpart Paul Nkata who had taken a new job at Bandari. He recorded a poor start to the season where they suffered defeat to lowly AS Port Louis of Mauritius in the Caf Champions League, a defeat to Gor Mahia in the Kenyan Premier League Super Cup, as well as two successive losses in their opening league matches against Nzoia Sugar and Thika United. The brewers however recovered in good time and are currently placed second on the log, same points with leaders Gor Mahia but with an inferior goal difference. email print email print

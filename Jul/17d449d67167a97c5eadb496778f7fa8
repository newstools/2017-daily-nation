National Intelligence Service (NIS) boss Phillip Kameru’s brother was among two people killed on Saturday night in a car crash on Kiandu-Othaya road in Nyeri County. Mr Augustine Mathenge was killed together with a friend who was travelling with him when the car rolled and plunged into Gura River at around 10PM. The crash happened about a kilometre from their home. Police records showed that the NIS boss’ brother was behind the wheel at the time of the crash and the passenger was identified as Patrick Kibue. Mr Mathenge was also the director of Nyeri based security company, Lichi Security.   The two are said to have been headed to Mr Mathenge’s home in Othaya from Kiandu in Tetu a few minutes to 10PM. Police said that the vehicle appeared to have veered off the road and rolled for over 100 metres down a cliff before landing into Gura River. Area residents recalled hearing a loud bang and seeing the Toyota Hilux double cabin rolling from the road. Mr James Wachira, a local, told the Nation that the passenger in the vehicle was thrown out as the car rolled but Mathenge remained inside until the pickup landed in the river.   “We saw lights rolling downhill and then a loud bang. When we rushed we found the driver lying by the car in the river. The passenger was thrown out,” said Mr Wachira. Efforts to rescue the two were unsuccessful as they died on the spot. It is however unclear what led to the accident. Nyeri South Divisional Police Commander Joseph Mwika while confirming the identity of the occupants of the vehicle said that investigations are underway to identify the cause of the crash.   “Both the driver and the passenger died on the spot. The cause of the crash is still unclear but investigations have begun,” said Mr Mwika. A rescue team from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) was on Sunday called in to pull the wreckage of the vehicle from the river.

Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has directed Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) to close their campuses in Rwanda and Tanzania. The directive comes days after the Tanzanian government blocked the two universities and 17 others from admitting students in September, citing wanting standards. In different letters to Kenyatta University Council Chairman Prof Shem Migot and his Jkuat counterpart Prof Paul Kanyari, Dr Matiang'i said the government was concerned with the existences of the campuses of the two institutions in Rwanda and Tanzania. “I urge the University council to deliberate on the way forward on the existence of the two campuses with a view of winding up,” said Dr Matiang’i. The CS said the closure will accord the two universities an opportunity to consolidate their resources within the existing campuses in Kenya.

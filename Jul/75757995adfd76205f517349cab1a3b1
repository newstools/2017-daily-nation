There was optimism last week after Kenya and Tanzania announced they had resolved a trade dispute that was threatening the economic and diplomatic ties between the two East African Community nations. However, despite the apparent truce, Kenyan businesses have complained that Tanzania has continued to place restrictions. Authorities in the neighbouring country have been accused of placing multiple hurdles for Kenyan products. It is noteworthy that Tanzanian traders now enjoy the benefits of the agreement that, among other things, has allowed them to bring into Kenya Liquefied Petroleum Gas and wheat. This not only leaves local traders at a disadvantage but is also frustrating, considering that the announcement of the deal by Kenya’s Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and her counterpart Augustine Mahiga was seen as an indicator of better times ahead. TRADE WARS It is important for the Foreign and Trade Cabinet Secretaries to take seriously issues raised by the business community, including the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, and resolve what appears to so far be a lopsided arrangement that favours Tanzania. It is in nobody’s interest for these two EAC members to sustain trade wars of any kind. While it is true Kenya-Tanzania relations have not been at their best in recent years, the latest move to resolve the standoff shows there is a great opportunity to resolve any pending economic and diplomatic issues. It is, however, crucial that any deal reached must be implemented fully and in good faith by both sides. Indeed, the region should by now have moved towards greater integration to harness the full potential of member states.

Team Kenya to the World Championships in Athletics opening on Friday in London has high hopes. The team will, indeed, be under pressure for a repeat performance of the 2015 Beijing showing, where Kenya topped the medal standings for the first time since the first edition in 1999. The Beijing show was significant as Julius Yego and Nicholas Bett handed the country its maiden titles in javelin and 400m hurdles, respectively. That saw the country bag 16 medals - even gold, six silver and three bronze - to come top. UNDER PRESSURE While Kenya will be under pressure to do better than in Beijing, we are confident that the team has done enough preparations and will deliver under the tutelage of veteran coach Julius Kirwa, who always has a midas touch. Kirwa led  Team Kenya to  success in the 2008 Beijing and 2016 Rio Olympic Games and the 2015 Beijing Worlds. With the championships coming during our elections due on August 8, it is another occasion to unite Kenyans. It can be recalled that the 2008 Beijing Olympics united Kenyans following the 2007/2008 post-election mayhem. August 8 will be quite significant as the elections will be on during the men’s 800m and 3,000m steeplechase finals. We hope Olympic and World 800m champion David Rudisha and Ezekiel Kemboi, the 3,000m steeplechase king, will lead colleagues to success.

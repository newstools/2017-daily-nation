The officials to be appointed by the Teachers Service Commission as senior masters in charge of curriculum implementation in schools must get set for the challenges ahead. But they will certainly help to ease the burden of headteachers often encumbered by a myriad of tasks, many of them extraneous to teaching. As curriculum specialists, they must ensure that schools stick to their core mandate of imparting quality knowledge. The TSC is only reaffirming the need to plug a gap in the teaching and learning process, which has contributed a great deal to the poor quality education. The officers must work closely with the headteachers to ensure their juniors stick to the curriculum and complete it on time. Unfortunately, the headteachers are basically school managers with a basic oversight role in the running of the institutions, which denies them the time and even capability to strictly monitor what goes on in the classrooms. It is imperative now that the TSC goes a step further and ensure that the appointees are not just figureheads, but are integrated in the system to be able to reprimand or recommend the punishment of teachers who fail to live up to the expected teaching standards. They should also routinely make proposals to the body on teacher shortages, teaching skill requirements and other needs that are peculiar to their individual schools.

Funyula MP Paul Otuoma, who is now vying for Busia governorship, has hit out at his rival, Governor Sospeter Ojaamong, saying he has failed to deliver services to the expectations of those who elected him. Dr Otuoma, who is contesting as an independent candidate, has asked residents to vote out Mr Ojaamong on August 8. Speaking Tuesday in Bumala ‘B’ in Butula Sub-County, where he held a series of rallies, Dr Otuoma said there is no difference between a devolved Busia and the defunct county councils. He was accompanied by his running mate Solomon Abwaku. “In 2013 we unanimously voted for my friend Ojaamong with the hope that he was going to address the needs of the people of Busia. “It pains us to see a person whom we helped ascend to power resorting to divisive politics on the backdrop of poor development record,” he said. ODM PRIMARIES The lawmaker insisted he was rigged out during ODM party nominations in April but remained confident that he will be the second Busia governor. He called on IEBC to conduct credible elections in order to ensure the will of the people prevails. “The people of Busia have suffered for the last five years under Ojaamong’s regime. We cannot compare our county with neighbours Kakamega, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia as we are still lagging behind in development,” said Dr Otuoma. In reaction, Governor Ojaamong exuded confidence that he will retain his seat. “I appeal to the voters to re-elect me to enable me complete what I have started. It has not been easy starting from the scratch,” the governor was quoted saying. The seat has also attracted Dan Barasa (Jubilee), Francis Oyatsi (UDP), John Mondoh (RBK) and Michael Oloo (Ford Kenya).   Busia governor candidate's choice is former deputy county commissioner Solomon Abwaku.

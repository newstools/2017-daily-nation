After a four-year break from the annual CBA Africa Concours d’Elegance, motorcycle enthusiast Douglas Kiereini will contest this year’s event with a 2007 Yamaha Frazer. Kiereini says he expects to win the up to 1,200 cc street motorcycles class. “It is hard work to prepare machines for the event, but it is always a joy to see admiration on spectators faces during the Concours.,” he said. The 2017 edition will be the 47th annual Concours organized by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club and will be held at the Nairobi Racecourse on September 24th. The Concours is sponsored by the Commercial Bank of Africa and is rated as the classiest event on the Kenya motorsport calendar. The competition has been an FIM Africa-recognised and sanctioned event since 2006. The event rewards the owners of well kept classic and vintage cars and bikes. There are 12 classes for all makes and types of cars, pick-ups and SUVs and seven categories for motorcycles. Regulations for listing in the event are available on www.concourskenya.com, or from the Bob Dewar Publicity offices in Block G of Norfolk Towers, Kijabe Street.

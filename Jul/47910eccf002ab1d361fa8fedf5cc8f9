The National Super Alliance (Nasa) has appointed Senator James Orengo as the coalition’s chief agent for the August 8 elections. Mr Orengo, a prominent lawyer and one of Mr Odinga’s staunchest supporters, will be deputised by Nasa Chief Executive Officer Norman Magaya. AGENTS Mr Magaya will serve as the alternate chief agent. Joe Ager, the head of operations and delivery at the Raila Odinga Campaign Secretariat, on Friday said the coalition had already submitted the names to the IEBC. Mr Ager said that the appointment of constituency and polling station agents was also at an advanced stage. "The coalition is ready for the August 8 General Election which Nasa expects to win by a large enough margin,” Mr Ager said in a statement to newsrooms. “I urge all Nasa polling agents, constituency polling agents and supporters in general to be prepared to turn out with one accord on 8 August; vote in force, meticulously protect the vote and deliver a resounding victory in order to deliver Kenya from the stifling misrule of Jubilee,” Mr Ager said. RIGGING The appointment comes against the backdrop of intense push and pull between the opposition and the electoral commission, which has insisted only one agent per party will be allowed at the tallying centre. This goes against Mr Odinga’s adopt-a-polling-station strategy, which he says will guard against any poll rigging. Nasa, however, might still have its way in lower seats since it is a coalition of many parties, each sponsoring candidates in the election. The candidates will have their agents.

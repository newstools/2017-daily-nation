LONDONDefending champion Andy Murray reached a 10th successive Wimbledon quarter-final on Monday with a 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-4 win over Benoit Paire of France.The world number one will face Sam Querrey, who he leads 7-1 in career meetings, for a place in the semi-finals."I thought I played well. Maybe a couple of sloppy service games in the first set but that was by far the best I'd hit the ball so far in the tournament. So I'm really pleased with that," said Murray."He's not an easy guy to play. He's got one of the best backhands."Only Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors (11 each) have reached more consecutive Wimbledon quarter-finals than Murray.The 30-year-old's progress is particularly noteworthy as he came into the tournament nursing a hip injury."Two weeks ago I was resting, I was also a little bit concerned when you're having issues a few days before a big event, it's frustrating," said Murray."But I've managed it well and I think I've played some good stuff."That was the best I've played so far in the tournament. I'm doing well so hopefully I keep it up." email print email print

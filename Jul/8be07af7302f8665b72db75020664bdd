They last met during the 2015 competition when Kenya posted their best result against the North Africans, winning 46-15.They met for the first time in 2005 where Kenyan triumphed 37-15 before meeting next in 2009 when Kenya lost 44-15. Kenya and Tunisia clashed at the 2011 final when Kenya won 16-7 at the RFUEA grounds. Their next meeting was during the 2012 championship with Kenya claiming a 31-24 victory in the play-offs for third place. Kenya suffered their heaviest defeat against Tunisia 52-5 back in 1997 when they met for the first time in a Test match.UGANDA WINIn the first around of matches, Kenya drew Uganda 33-33 in Nairobi while Zimbabwe humbled Senegal 28-16 in Dakar.In the second round, Uganda beat Senegal 17-16 in Dakar while defending champions Namibia launched their campaign strongly, beating hosts Tunisia 41-7 in Tunis.Kenya, who are seeking their first win, are glad to have their inspirational skipper Wilson K Opondo back, having recovered from a rib injury. K Opondo dislocated his rib during the Simbas Test match against Germany on May 27 at the RFUEA grounds. Simbas lost the match 30-29.The injury saw the Kenya Harlequin lock miss both the two-legged Elgon Cup outing against Uganda where the Simbas retained the trophy on a 56-51 aggregate win. The Elgon Cup s second leg tie in Nairobi, which ended in a 33-33 draw, doubled up as the Rugby Africa Gold Cup first match for both Kenya and Uganda.K Opondo will partner with Kabras Sugar player George Nyambua at second row. Nyambua, who came off the bench in the last three Simbas outing, has been handed a starting berth. Also starting after coming off the bench in the last three outings is Impala Saracens Leo Seje, who will partner David Ambunya in midfield.The duel will also see the return of Lyle Asiligwa (Quins), Oscar Simiyu (KCB), Martin Owila (KCB) and Dennis Muhanji (Quins) to Jerome Paarwater s side that will be facing Tunisia for the first time since 2015. Those who will miss the duel are Oliver Mang eni (KCB), who is bereaved and Simon Muniafu (Impala Saracens), who has an injury while Patrice Agunda (Quins), James Kubasu (Impala Saracens) and Brad Owako (Mwamba) have all been rested.While naming the team, Team manager Wangila Simiyu indicated that they have made the changes with a view of countering their opponents, who have heavy forwards. That is why we want K Opondo to partner with Nyambua and Joshua Chisanga with Davis Chenge because of their ball carrying ability, said Wangila. SQUAD15. Tony Onyango, 14. Darwin Mukidza, 13.

Dear Brenda,I have been having this problem in my two-year relationship with my boyfriend. I have enough money to take care of myself but I feel as a man he needs to take care of his woman especially because I already have pocket money but I also have extra needs too that the amount can't take care of. Should I ask for the money from my boyfriend or just be an independent girl?PS. He does not have a problem giving the money. Please help. Chuiquitta Lady, you are wrong. You have been dating this man for two years. He has not made a commitment to you. Until he does, then you are wrong to refer to yourself as his woman. You are not.Once he makes a commitment to you, then you can start demanding wife privileges. Until then, work for your own pocket money or ask your father for some.Let me let you in on a secret independence in a woman is utterly attractive.Got a question for Brenda?

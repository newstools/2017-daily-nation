The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) plans to expand the Walda integrated food security and livelihood irrigation project in Marsabitâ€™s Moyale Sub-County. Speaking during a tour of the irrigation farm, KRCS Secretary-General Abbas Gullet said that there are more than 200 hectares of land available yet the project has only utilised 64 hectares. He was accompanied by officials from the Ministry of Water. Mr Gullet said that availability of fresh water is the main challenge that slows the expansion of the farm. BUILD DAMS "Once we have finances we will build three dams that will supply the farm, the locals and their livestock with fresh water," said Mr Gullet. He sais the project is funded by the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) through the adaptation fund. He said the project began in 2012 after the 2011 drought but it was mismanaged, leading to its failure before Nema intervened. "At some point this project failed but we never gave up. However, we managed to get aid from Nema through which we have developed it using the Sh67 million given to us three years ago," said Mr Gullet. The farm produces watermelons, butternuts, and a variety of vegetables as well as pasture for livestock. THREE SEASONS The farmers plant for three seasons a year and they harvest up to 3,000 metric tonnes of foodstuffs per season. Mr Gullet said 12 hectares have been set aside for pasture to ensure the community continues to rear livestock while still farming. "We believe the pastoralist communities can also do farming. At the moment livestock have outgrown the grazing space hence the need for mixed farming," said Mr Gullet. The director for water storage Robinson Gaita, who represented Water Minister Eugene Wamalwa, said the ministry will ensure the project is funded for expansion as soon as possible. "Water storage means water security and translates to food security hence the expansion of this project will secure our county and country," said Mr Gaita.

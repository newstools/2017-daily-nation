Kenya has been experiencing severe drought since the short rains failed last year. And reports indicate a worsening situation. Many counties are reporting severe food shortages, leading to widespread hunger. Pasture and water for livestock have dried up. Water taps are dry and, in most areas, rivers depleted. Some of the worst affected counties are in northern Kenya, parts of the Rift Valley, Coast and Nyanza. Even the usually endowed areas, such as the Mount Kenya region, are recording famine. Already, the depressed water levels have led to water rationing in Nairobi. Kenya Power has warned of decreased capacity of its hydro sources to generate sufficient electricity. Food, water and power shortages inevitably precipitate price increases. With rains only expected around April, the situation is likely to get worse. Our challenge, though, is the inability to plan for the hard times. Weather forecasts warned a while ago that rains would to fail and that should have jolted the State to put in place contingency measures to mitigate the attendant hardships. Nothing was done. The national and county governments must act quickly and decisively to cushion citizens from the devastation of drought through food rations and water supply. However, we need long-term measures to mitigate the predictable cyclic drought that often hits the country.

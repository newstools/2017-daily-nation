Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has linked a fire incident that razed over 1000 houses in Mathare slums in December last year to politics. The December 27 fire in Mabatini left 507 houses and another 600 in Mathare Area Four reduced to ashes. Speaking in the area on Tuesday when he visited the victims and donated Sh500,000, Dr Kidero said that six people had died from the incident. He claimed that the fires were unnatural and only occurred during election years to chase away voters from the city. "These fires are more especially when we are approaching the election and we know that it is a political ploy to relocate our voters," said Dr Kidero. He said that the residents who experience these fire incidences are mainly Cord supporters in Opposition strongholds. Dr Kidero cautioned the residents against being used by politicians to forcibly eject their neighbours and instead work towards living in harmony. Over 1200 people were left homeless following the incident. Some are currently camping at the Maranatha Church while those who had been hosted in AIC Zion had to vacate when schools reopened. “We had part of our school razed down in AIC Zion near Moi Airbase but the church was not affected,” said a resident, George Mutuku. Mr Mutuku said that the houses were however re-constructed and most of the residents are back. Dr Kidero said that one of the victims admitted at Utalii dispensary had been unable as she had inhaled smoke. He urged the residents to observe safety measures while using Jikos and stoves.

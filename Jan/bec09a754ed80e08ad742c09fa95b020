A tea grower has threatened to go to court in seven days if he is not declared the winner of the just concluded Gitugi tea factory elections. In a petition filled to the returning officer and KTDA secretary-general Kennedy Ongwae, the farmer, Mr Daniel Thaithi, argues there was an intention to rig him out. Mr Thaithi has protested against the election results saying they were not free and fair and a lot of election malpractices were witnessed. “Money changed hands at Muguai tea buying centre in the full glare of the electorates, security officers and election officers just inside the jurisdiction of the electoral compound,” read the petition. He also vowed to adduce evidence of the same. Mr James Waithitu was declared the winner and director of Gitugi tea factory director of the election with 6, 627 votes against 6, 602 votes. According to Mr Thuo all the incumbent directors retained their position for another three years. “There was no consensus prior to vote counting hence rejecting my 401 votes through an arbitrary decision,” said Mr Thaithi. He further said the irregularities were well-choreographed. “A repeat of the elections should be conducted forthwith with full compensation on my part, election expenses and time wasted,” he said. All the directors in the five tea factories in Nyeri retained their seats. Efforts to reach the returning officer for a comment were futile as he was not responding to calls.

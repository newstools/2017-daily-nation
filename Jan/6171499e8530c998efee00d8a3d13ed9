Starring Andy Samberg, Jennifer Aniston, Kelsey Grammer, Katie Crown I am late to the Storks party but I am definitely a convert! Storks is one of last year’s (we are already saying last year!) animations that took a Top 5 place for me (among animations, not all movies). It’s a cartoon about the evolution of the role of storks in modern-day society – whereas once they used to deliver babies, wink wink, they now are a multi-floored parcel delivery outfit, in the skies, of course. Junior is a stork on the rise who is dying to become The Boss. The Boss gives him a task to do, which he fails, and sets himself on a path to what can only be an amusing catastrophe. The first half of the movie, for me anyway, was incredibly slow, but eventually it built up to the point where I was wheezing with laughter. It’s a great one for the family.

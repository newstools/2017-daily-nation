Tight Squeeze, the aptly named mare who had to be rescued by firefighters after getting stuck in a muddy brook, is perfectly happy again, and, showing no ill effects from her ordeal. The former Peter Hiatt-trained mare, who won 14 of 87 races, was enjoying retirement with owner-breeder Chuck Harrison at Wigginton, near Banbury, when she got into trouble after sliding down a bank. About 15 people helped with the animal rescue team, joined by local firefighters. It took a good two hours, as they had to dig the bank out while she thrashed around every now and again. She's ever such a tough old bird at 20 years old. In over two decades, no other horse has ever been in that dilemma. Working closely with the vet, slings and harnesses secured Tight Squeeze, preventing further slippage. After a number of attempts to persuade her out under her own steam failed, it was evident that the rescue was becoming more complex as she was sinking further into the mud, and also into a state of unconsciousness.

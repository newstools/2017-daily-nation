Patients requiring diagnostic services for various ailments within Nyeri and neighbouring regions can sigh with relief after Consolata Mission Hospital Mathari, procured high-end diagnostic equipment worth Sh200 million. The equipment include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan and ultra sound machines for diseases such as cancer, tumours and neuro problems diagnosis. They will help alleviate suffering of patients who travel far in search of the services. “This is a milestone for us in our endeavour of improving diagnostics tests,” said Chief Executive Officer Bernard Mureithi. Mr Mureithi said the equipment, especially the MRI that is one of its kind in the area, will also serve neighbouring regions of Eastern, North Eastern and parts of Rift Valley. He added that the equipment were affiliated and accredited with National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and thus services will be offered free of charge for patients with the health insurer’s cards. “Our affiliation with NHIF makes the services very affordable for all our patients,” remarked Mureithi, adding that the services will run all year without closures.

He however said they have put structures in place to ensure no patient is turned away as he appealed for all stakeholders to step in to end the impasse. Nyeri Catholic Archbishop Peter Kairu who also graced the occasion called for dialogue between the government and striking doctors to alleviate patients’ suffering.

Leading Money transfer company Dahabshiil has threatened to launch a criminal complaint against a blogger it accuses of publishing 'fake' stories about it. The blogger, Mr Dahir Alasow, owner of "Waagacusub Media”, according to the firm, has been using different websites to attack the firm. Late last month the Dutch Court of Appeal ('s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands) ruled on Dahabshiil’s latest claim against Mr Alasow in relation to the publication of various defamatory articles, but this, says the firm, has not deterred him from continuous assault on Dahabshiil. However, the court declined to find that the matter was too complicated for the Dutch preliminary relief procedure. Instead it suggested that Dahabshiil should pursue Mr Alasow through a full court claim or through the criminal system. In a statement, the company says: “Dahabshiil takes due note of the Court of Appeal’s suggestion that it could pursue the case via other routes and fully intends to do so. “However, we also note that the same Court of Appeal in earlier proceedings ruled that claims of this kind were suitable for preliminary relief against Mr Alasow, so we are considering taking the matter to the Dutch Supreme Court," it adds. Dahabshiil has a presence in over 100 countries, including Kenya and works with numerous blue chip organisations. Previously the court of Breda and the Dutch Supreme Court had ruled in favour of Dahabshiil, declaring evidence presented by Mr Alasow to be fabricated and that the allegations he had published were "lacking factual support". The court order, reviewed by the Court of Appeal last month, related to a series of claims made by Mr Alasow on his sites and asked him to publish rectifications for 12 months. Dahabshiil has taken Mr Alasow to court for defamation on three separate occasions, first bringing legal proceedings against him in November 2010.   Mr Cameron had been expected to visit Kenya and Ethiopia in his African tour.

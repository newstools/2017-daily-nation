Kisii County ODM chairman Samuel Omwando who was involved in a road crash this morning has been transferred to a Nairobi hospital for further treatment. Mr Omwando was treated in Tenwek Mission Hospital and doctors said he was in stable condition. Calvin Omwando, his son, said his father complained of chest and back pains, which doctors said was caused by chest fracture. "He has been referred to a Nairobi hospital but we believe he is well," Calvin said. His car collided with a matatu at 5am this morning at Kemera on Kisii-Nyamira road. His car crashed this morning when he was travelling from Nakuru to Kisii. The chairman's driver, Nyakundi Bosire, told the Nation that the incident occurred after he tried to avoid colliding with the matatu that was overtaking another vehicle. "The matatu was speeding. My efforts to drive the car off the road and avoid head on collision were in vain," he said.   Mr Bosire was not injured. Mr Omwando is eyeing the Kitutu Chache South parliamentary seat. Kisii Governor James Ongwae wished him quick recovery. "Mr Omwando is a leader who has been of great help to us. We wish him quick recovery so that he comes back and help us in running the party affairs in Kisii," he said.

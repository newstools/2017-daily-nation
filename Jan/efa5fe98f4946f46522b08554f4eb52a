A man convicted of defiling a child has been jailed for life by a Mombasa court. Mombasa Senior Resident Magistrate Martin Rabera convicted Jimmy Mwanzo, 60, on Tuesday. Mr Rabera said Mwanzo was found guilty of the act as delineated in Section 8(1) of the Sexual Offences Act. Mwanzo committed the offence against his neighbour's eight-year-old daughter on May 30 last year in Kibarani village, Changamwe Sub-County, in Mombasa. In his judgement, the magistrate said he was convinced beyond reasonable doubt, after hearing consistent testimonies from prosecution witnesses, that the accused was guilty. He said testimony from the girl's mother and neighbours indicated that the girl was seen running out of the man's house crying before the man escaped through the back door. He was caught and taken to the Changamwe Police Station, where he was charged. Mr Rabera said the girl's family and the defiler were neighbours for more than 10 years. "The evidence tendered by the complainant is truthful....," he ruled. Mwanzo has 14 days to appeal the judgement.

Deputy President William Ruto and his entourage on Monday faced hostility from rowdy youths in Bungoma town as he toured the county to encourage locals to register as voters in the ongoing listing exercise. The youths, who were chanting pro-Opposition slogans, blocked the main bus terminus in the border town and set ablaze Jubilee-branded T-shirts at around 3pm. The DP, who was accompanied by Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, was on his way from Mumias in Kakamega County to address a rally in Bungoma's town centre. Mr Ruto had to change the route and was forced to use the Mateka-Kanduyi road to link to the Malaba-Webuye highway before later addressing a rally in Webuye, several kilometres from Bungoma town. “This is Nasa and Cord zone…we have suffered a lot in the last five years and we don’t want more miseries,” one of the youths said as a crowd set ablaze Jubilee-branded T-shirts. The security team was overpowered by the youths, who at one point attempted to set on fire billboards bearing images of the Jubilee Party. Cord leader Raila Odinga was expected in the county on Monday, but his trip was postponed to later this week. On Sunday, Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi was in the town to mobilise eligible voters to enlist ahead of the August polls.

Calm has been restored in Muruguru after residents blocked the Nyeri-Karatina road to protest rising accidents. The residents barricaded the road using stones and bonfires and urged the Kenya National Highway Authority to erect speed bumps to reduce the number of accidents. Police cleared the debris and put out the bonfires. Muruguru MCA Mwangi Kibuu said many people had been knocked down and killed in the area by speeding vehicles especially on the stretch between the KenGen junction and Gatitu shopping centre. He said the most recent person killed there was a 55-year-old man on December 26. "We are tired of having regular funerals in the village. Our youth are also getting tired of digging graves. "We want action and we are demanding it. Next week we will dig trenches to ensure vehicles do not speed," said John Muriu, a resident. Nyeri Central Assistant County Commissioner John Marete told the protesters he would make sure the matter is sorted out.

Amos Mathu has won Sh900,000 in the Betway Multibet after placing bets on nine different basketball games. The 37-year old chef placed the bets on the National Basketball Association (NBA) games last Saturday, and was notified of his success on Wednesday afternoon. Mathu said he plans to direct the money won to expand his chicken business. “I received the information while in a bus and I didn’t think much of it because I thought it was just Sh90,000. I found out it was almost Sh1 million yesterday when I went to make the withdrawal,” he said. COOK FOR MANY YEARS Mathu hails from Maragwa in Muranga County, and has worked as a chef in Mombasa for 12 years. Mathu also plans to connect electricity to his mother’s house. The fact that Mathu won through a multiple bet rather than the Betway Bonanza or Jackpot means that the latter remain the same. The Betway Jackpot thus stands at Sh26,440,970 and the Betway Bonanza at Sh86,450,475.

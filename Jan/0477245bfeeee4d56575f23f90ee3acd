National football team, Harambee Stars, was on Thursday pooled alongside giants Ghana in the 2019 Cup of Nations qualifiers. Stars, who last made an appearance at the Cup of Nations in Tunisia 13 years ago, face a herculean task in their quest for a chance to play in the continental showpiece with five-time winners Ghana and local rivals Ethiopia in Group F that also includes Sierra Leone . Harambee Stars yet again failed to make it to the 2017 edition which starts on Saturday in Gabon. FAVOURITES Ghana, who are in Group C alongside Uganda, Mali Egypt in the Gabon tournament, are favourites to clinch the top spot and automatic qualification for the 2019 showpiece. Stars, who climbed two places in the latest Fifa Rankings released on Thursday by the global football governing body, have improved in recent months under coach Stanley Okumbi. Okumbi, who took over from Scot Bobby Williamson in March last year, had a false start in which the Stars lost back to back games to minnows Guinea Bissau in the 2017 Cup of Nations qualifiers which ended their hopes of making it to Gabon. Stars' last engagement was identical 1-0 wins over Liberia and Mozambique in international friendly matches held at the Safaricom Stadium, Kasarani last November.

The arrival of the abrasive Donald Trump in the White House must be a source of anxiety among some African leaders. Had Mrs Hillary Clinton won the presidency in last year’s election, there would have been little surprise, as she knows them well. Mr Trump is already questioning spending on the war on terrorism, especially against Somalia’s al-Shabaab. He is also not keen on the Agoa free trade arrangement under which African countries export goods to the US, especially textiles, under special tariff rates. Also on his radar is the generous US presidential Aids Fund, and many in Africa wonder what to expect next. As he succeeds the first African-American president, Barack Obama, the 45th man to hold the position will have his job cut out for him. Already, there are questions over his suspected close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and causing some disquiet among US allies is his dismissal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as “obsolete”. He also supports Brexit. Mr Trump also plans to move the US embassy in Israeli from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that will be vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, and has also vowed to cancel the Iran nuclear agreement. It is too early to tell, but Mr Trump could just endear himself to Africa, with more visits than Mr Obama’s only four during his eight-year tenure.

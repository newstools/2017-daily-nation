Tea earned farmers in Kirinyaga County Sh2.3 billion bonus last year. Jane Mugo, chief executive officer of Bingwa Sacco, said the farmers were happy with the payment. "Farmers who are members of our sacco received handsome bonus and this is very encouraging. The bonus was released to our sacco and we paid them," she told the press in Kerugoya town. She attributed the high income to conducive weather conditions and hard work of farmers. "In some factories farmers were getting Sh48 per kilogramme of produce delivered. The production was also high because of the favourable weather while farmers worked very hard in their farms," she said. She added that the farmers had contributed largely to the growth of the sacco and they would continue getting quality services. "We shall continue delivering quality services to the farmers who form part of the members of the sacco which has grown tremendously over the years," she said. The membership has upswung from 200 to 150, 000 members in a span of 20 years. The firm has also received State recognition for being the best managed sacco in the country.

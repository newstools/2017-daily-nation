A Tanzanian national charged alongside five Kenyans over the killing of 147 people at Garissa University two years ago has been ordered to undergo a mental assessment to determine his fitness to stand trial. Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi directed prison authorities to escort Rashid Charles Mberesero, aka Rehani Dida, to Mathari Mental Hospital for the tests. Prosecutor Duncan Ondimu applied to have him taken for a final assessment as directed by the psychiatrist who was attending to him at Mathari. Mr Ondimu said the mental status of the accused could not be assessed due to the current doctors' strike. “I urge this court to grant us one more chance to get the mental report about the accused before the trial resumes,” Mr Ondimu urged. He added that the trial is not being delayed by the prosecution as alleged by the defence. “Every time this case comes up for a hearing, I usually have at least 10 witnesses in court, then it fails to take off due to reasons advanced by the defence,” Mr Ondimu said. He said he intends to call more than 30 witnesses in the case. Mr Andayi directed that the case be mentioned on January 24 to establish whether the accused has been taken for a mental examination. Mr Mberesero is charged alongside Mohamed Surow, Osman Dakane, Mohamed Abikar, Hassan Hassan and Sahal Hussein over the attack on the university on April 2, 2015.   The doctor stated that the suspect requires continuous medication.

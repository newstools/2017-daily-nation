Leaders of Siaya County have vowed not to participate in the August elections if there are indications that it will not be free and fair. Senator James Orengo, MPs Jakoyo Midiwo (Gem), Nicholas Gumbo (Rarieda), Gideon Ochanda (Bondo) and former National Party Alliance (TNA) Secretary-General Onyango Oloo questioned Jubilee legislators' motive for reviewing the electoral laws to introduce the use of manual backup system if the electronic one fails. "We will not go into an election that is not transparent, accountable, credible and verifiable," Mr Orengo said. Senator Orengo also told the new Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officials to involve the Opposition in preparing for the polls. Mr Wafula Chebukati is chairing the commission. "We also need to be involved as equal stakeholders in the elections preparation and deliver a free and fair poll," he added. He spoke in Siaya during the burial of Dr Janet Midiwo, the Gem MPâ€™s sister in-law. Mr Midiwo said that they will not allow any action that will compromise the credibility of the oncoming elections to take place. "In 2013 we were led into an election that was full of irregularities and we accepted defeat. This time we will not allow that to happen," he said. Mr Midiwo called on their supporters to vote out the Jubilee leadership by electing the opposition Cord. More importantly, he told the IEBC to clean up the voters' registry to ensure a tenable outcome.

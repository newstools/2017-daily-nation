The Commission for University Education (CUE) has said it has no powers to cancel certificates given to people who might have graduated without meeting published requirements. Only a university senate in collaboration with the board of examiners have such authority, according to CUE chief executive David Some. He said the commission has a role to check the quality of education at institutions of higher learning and take appropriate measures to address emerging issues. Prof Some said degree course eligibility criteria are clearly stipulated in the 2014 University Regulations and the 2014 University Standards. “It is clear that one must have a C-plus in KCSE or must have done a diploma examined by the Kenya National Examination Council or its equivalent,” Prof Some said on Tuesday. He explained that it is the university senate that should ensure the scores in a diploma are equivalent to the credits required for one to be certified as a diploma holder. Prof Some confirmed that the commission was in the process of auditing universities to ensure they comply with admission standards as enshrined in the Universities Act. “The audit is going back to five years since the Act came into force. It is meant to make sure the university senate has the right information on the admissions,” he said. He challenged Kenyans not to question such quality checks, saying they are important in maintaining high-quality education that is globally competitive.

Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has accused Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula of undermining him politically. Mr Oparanya has told the Ford-Kenya leader to stop wasting time making campaign forays in Kakamega County in the hope that his deputy Boni Khalwale will be elected the next governor. The governor was responding to remarks by Mr Wetang’ula who asked residents of Kakamega to elect Dr Khalwale as their next governor if they expect meaningful development in the region after the August polls. Mr Oparanya spoke in his office at the county headquarters on Tuesday. Mr Wetang’ula said Ford-Kenya is confident of taking the governor’s seat and will field candidates for elective seats at all levels in all the regions. But Mr Oparanya said Senator Khalwale has nothing new to offer and is wasting time trying to clinch the governor’s seat. “Senator Wetang’ula should stop showing disrespect to me during his campaign rallies in Kakamega. Let him know that voters in Kakamega will have the final says on m their next governor will be and his attacks on my administration are a waste of time,” said Mr Oparanya. SUPPORT RAILA ODINGA Mr Oparanya asked residents of Kakamega County to support Cord leader Raila Odinga for presidency saying he the former prime minister is best suited for the job. He said as the deputy ODM leader, he is confident Mr Odinga is the best person who can clinch the presidency as the opposition flag bearer. “I have known Mr Odinga for the last 15 years and he is the only suitable candidate who can take on President Uhuru Kenyatta and clinch the presidency in the August polls,” said Mr Oparanya. He said he has spoken to Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and asked him to back Mr Odinga for presidency. “If Mr Odinga is elected the next president, Kenyans will move in the right direction politically and be able to achieve a lot in terms of developments,” said Mr Oparanya.

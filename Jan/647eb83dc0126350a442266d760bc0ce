Angry parents Tuesday stormed three schools in Tharaka-Nithi County demanding the transfer of the headteachers. They accused the school heads of misappropriation of funds, poor management and poor performance. At Nditune Secondary School in Maara Sub-County, parents ejected Principal Fredrick Mutegi and nailed timber on the office door. They accused him of poor management and misappropriation of funds, leading to a drop in examination performance. “The school might soon face closure by the Ministry of Education for lack of students because most have been transferred to neighbouring schools,” said Ms Mary Muthoni, a parent. At Ubarini Primary School in Tharaka Sub-County, parents withdrew their children from classrooms and demonstrated to the zonal education offices in Tunyai market demanding that headteacher Peter Mutegi be transferred. NO ELECTRICITY IN SCHOOL They accused him of failing to ensure the school is connected to electricity. Contacted, Mr Mutegi said he had called the county rural electrification officer who assured him that a transformer would be erected at the school in two-weeks. “All arrangements are there to ensure the school is connected to electricity and I urge the parents to be patient,” said Mr Mutegi. At Gatituni Primary School in Chuka/Igambang’ombe, parents said poor management coupled with misappropriation of funds have led to the school population dropping from 320 pupils to 140 in the last three years. The chairman of the school’s board of management Wilson Gitonga told Nation.co.ke that the headteacher had embezzled Sh200,000 collected during a fundraiser for building offices. Mr Gitonga added that school’s performance has dropped terribly and parents are not ready to allow the teacher to continue managing the school. “The sub-county education office has assured us that everything will be solved in a week,” said Mr Gitonga.

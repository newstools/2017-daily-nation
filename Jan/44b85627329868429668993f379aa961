Chief Justice David Maraga has said some of the disputes after this year's elections will be heard by courts in Nakuru if the construction of new courtrooms is completed in time. Mr Maraga, who spoke in Nakuru during the inspection of the ultra-modern judicial building, said the structure will house courts where matters relating to the August 8 polls will be heard and determined. He said there will be adequate courtrooms. The construction consultant Britson Nyakundi said the works will be completed by August 18 this year. “If the courtrooms are completed on time, some of the election petitions will be transferred from Nairobi to Nakuru,” the CJ said. The Judiciary boss said petitions will be heard beginning late August or early September. Mr Maraga also announced the deployment of two more judges who will handle labour and employment-related cases. This brings the total number of High Court judges at the station to seven. Moreover, he instructed the contractors to ensure the courtrooms are security-friendly to protect judges and magistrates from attacks. Last year on November 23 in Kapsabet Law Courts, Nandi County, Senior Resident Magistrate Cherono Kesse was attacked by a suspect while presiding over a case. But Ms Kesse managed to escape unhurt. The CJ was accompanied by Chief Registrar in the Judiciary Anne Amadi to Molo and Eldama Ravine law courts. He officiated the commissioning of the Nakuru children’s courts where he directed magistrates and judges to speed up the determination of cases.

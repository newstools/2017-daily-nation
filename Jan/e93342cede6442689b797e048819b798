President Kenyatta has replaced the Commission for Revenue Allocation (CRA) team, including chairman Micah Cheserem. This follows the expiry of the terms of Mr Cheserem and his eight commissioners on December 31 last year. The new commissioners, whose names were published in the Kenya Gazette, on Friday include Edward Akong’o Oyugi, a former political detainee and close associate of Cord leader Raila Odinga. Prof Oyugi contested the Migori gubernatorial seat in the 2013 election but lost to Okoth Obado. Others are Peter Njeru Gachuba, Kishanto Ole Suuji, Irene Koech Asienga, Fauza Abdikadir Dahir, Humphrey Wattanga, Peter Kiko Kimuyu and Treasury Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge. Only Dr Thugge was retained from the previous team by virtue of his position as Treasury PS. The gazette notice does not indicate who will chair the commission. The outgoing commissioners include Mr Cheserem, vice-chairperson Fatuma Abdikadir, Wafula Masai, Amina Ahmed, Joseph Kimura and Rose Osoro. Others are Raphael Munavu and Meshack Onyango. “The process of replacing the outgoing commissioners has been ongoing since the term of the outgoing commissioners came to an end on December 31 after they served their six-year non-renewable term,” said a source at the CRA who requested anonymity because only Mr Cheserem is authorised to speak to the media on commission matters. The CRA is a creation of the 2010 Constitution. Its core mandate is to recommend the basis for equitable sharing of revenues raised nationally between the national and the county governments, and among county governments. The commission is also charged with making recommendations on matters concerning the financing of both the national government and county governments.

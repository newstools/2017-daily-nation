Young medical students are at a higher risk of suffering from burnout compared with their peers studying non-health-related courses, a survey has shown. They are also more likely to suffer from stress in their fourth, fifth and sixth year of clinical study due to long working hours and vigorous training. The average respondent in the survey, called "Medlife" and conducted by the Medical Students Association of Kenya's (MSAKE), was 22 and 23 years old studying at the University of Nairobi. The survey was part of MSAKE's "Speak It Out Mental Health Campaign". The report's author, Marie-Claire Wangari, the 2015/16 MSAKE national officer on medical education, said most of the students suffer stress because they lack time for regular exercise and sleep and do not get enough support. Depression rates were found to be at a higher rate among medical students and residents. The survey found that there are significant levels of burnout among medical students. The burnout can lead to poor mental and social health. The survey was conducted from November 2015 to June 2016 and the results were released in June 2016. Ms Wangari said that in spite of the impact of mental disorders on the academic performance of medical students and their quality of life, the conditions do not receive adequate attention.

A woman's naked body was found on Thursday in a thicket in Kibuka Village in Tharaka-Nithi County in a suspected case of rape and murder. A child was also found suckling on the lifeless body. Kibuka Assistant Chief Mathew Kabira said the incident was reported by a resident, Stephen Kinyua, who was walking along the Skylimit road when he heard a child crying from a nearby bush. "On checking, he found a naked body of a female adult and a child suckling," Mr Kabira said. He said the body was later identified to be that of Purity Kathomo from Tunyai Village. The victim's clothes were not at the scene, with a police report stating that she might have been raped before being killed. The body was taken to the Chuka County Referral Hospital mortuary. Police are investigating the death.

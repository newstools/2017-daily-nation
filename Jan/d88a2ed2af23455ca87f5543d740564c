The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) plans to register at least four million new voters in the second round of its mass voter registration campaign, which begins next week. This may sound quite ambitious, but it is important to get as many eligible Kenyans as possible to play a role in choosing their leaders. During the first phase early last year, less than a million new voters were registered, against a target of four million. Perhaps the fact that the next General Election is just under eight months away will inspire many more people to get listed. Should they fail to take advantage of this opportunity, they will have themselves to blame for being disenfranchised. According to the National Registration Bureau, about nine million holders of the Kenyan identification card have not enlisted as voters. Locking out such a huge number from casting their ballots can only undermine our otherwise vibrant democracy. The electoral commission has already enrolled 16 million voters, which is six million below its 2017 target, but that is achievable in the month-long window. Voter registration is an opportunity for the IEBC to show that it is on the right track in its preparations for the August 8 General Election.

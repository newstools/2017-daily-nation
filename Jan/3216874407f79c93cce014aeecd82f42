Leader from Chuka/Igambang’ombe constituency have endorsed their MP Muthomi Njuki to contest for the Tharaka-Nithi governor seat in the coming elections. Members of the Chuka/Igambang’ombe Constituency Leaders Forum said Mr Njuki is best suited for the post owing to his commendable development record as MP. Mr George Mati, the chairman, said they are ready to reimburse the money former Nithi MP Petkay Miriti used in his campaigns so that he can step down. The meeting was held in Chuka town on Friday. "They are our sons and we will make sure that Mr Miriti agrees to step down for Mr Njuki so that we can have the seat in our constituency," Mr Mati said. Mutemi Njeru, the secretary, said they will hold a subsequent meeting so that the two aspirants can agree on a suitable solution. "We want to make sure that Mr Njuki wins the seat. But it is almost impossible if the two, who will contest on a Jubilee Party ticket, battle it out for the nomination," Mr Njeru said. The team said incumbent Samuel Ragwa, and his deputy Mati Murithi, have failed to initiate development and have misappropriated public funds. However, Mr Miriti called a press conference where he rubbished the forum's decision, saying they are Mr Njuki's supporters masquerading as community leaders. He said: "These were people paid by Mr Njuki to endorse him [and] pretend to be leaders."

He served as an MP from 2002 to 2007 and as assistant minister for Trade from 2006 to 2007. Further, he said he dissolved his United Patriotic Party of Kenya to join Jubilee Party. His running mate, former Tharaka MP Nyamu Kagwima, said a governor should be endorsed by elders and leaders across the county and not one constituency.

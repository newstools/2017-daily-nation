Kenya Power chief executive Ben Chumo has exited the utility firm after an activist moved to court seeking to block him from serving a second term. The company’s chairman Kenneth Marende will Wednesday afternoon announce the person who takes over Kenya Power’s corner office in an acting capacity, pending fresh recruitment of a substantive CEO. “The Chairman of the Kenya Power board of directors Kenneth Marende will announce the new acting managing director of the company this afternoon following the exit of its current CEO, Ben Chumo,” the firm said in an update.

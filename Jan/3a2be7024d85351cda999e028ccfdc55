Saccos have played a key role in lifting standards of Kenyans through affordable loans, Chai Sacco CEO Festus Mwambingu has said. He said Saccos have been able to come up with products that suit different needs of members. “Well managed Sacco’s can be the saving grace of the community. A number of them are offering cheap loans,” he said. He gave an example of Chai Sacco which offers a number of products that includes loans and savings products that has in the recent past attracted an increase in membership to the current 22,000. Speaking from his office at KTDA’s Plaza, Mr Mwambingu said most Sacco members do not fail to repay loans due to low interest rates and lending is mostly based on one’s shares. “A borrower can receive a loan 3 to 4 times his or her shares and have 36 to 48 months to repay,” he said. He encouraged more Kenyans to join Saccos and take advantage of the products.

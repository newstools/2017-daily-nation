The effects of President Donald Trump’s executive order essentially barring citizens of seven predominantly Muslim nations from United States (US) soil are already being felt. On Saturday, several visa holders were stopped from entering America, despite having obtained their entry permits well before the executive order was signed. An Egypt Air flight headed to New York barred Yemeni and Iraqi nationals from boarding. Meanwhile, the tech giant Google issued an urgent call to about 100 of its members of staff to rush back to the US. It is difficult to overstate what a propaganda victory this is for extremist groups. From Isis to al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab – all murderous and savage entities – their claim has consistently been that Islam is under siege by powerful, predominantly Christian countries led by the United States. By his indiscriminate actions against the citizens of Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Iran, Libya and Sudan, the Trump administration has handed a propaganda gift to the extremists. Collective punishment of whole populations is a tactic that has been used in some of the most shameful episodes in human history. It is shocking to see these actions taken by the very Americans that have often preached liberal democratic values to the world. It is doubly ironic that the country whose wars have caused so much upheaval around the world, from Iraq to Libya to Syria and, indirectly, in Somalia and Yemen, can take such draconian measures. Among the greatest victims of these arbitrary actions will be the most vulnerable refugees that have been uprooted from their homes by wars that are not of their own making. It is true that Trump had threatened these measures during the campaigns. But the sweeping and ruthless nature of such decrees will be surely counterproductive.

Speaking when he was visited by another ex-Kenya international custodian, Mahmoud “Kenya One” Abbas at his home in Tononoka, Mombasa on Sunday, Mohammed asked the Daily Nation sports desk to convey his message to President Kenyatta to visit him the way he did to Joe Kadenge. “I played for the national team with Kadenge and others but remain suffering heart disease for the past two years and I tried to seek help from various leaders in vain,” said Mohammed. Sixty nine year-old Mohammed request the President to help him able to go to India for treatment. “Having served for the national team several years in the past, I hope President Kenyatta will recognise that and help me get treatment for the disease I’m suffering,” he said. Mohammed said he has high hopes when President Kenyatta comes to Mombasa, he will spare some time to see him the way he is suffering. “I’m one of the sportsmen who served my country with all my heart and I hope the President will come to my rescue,” he said.

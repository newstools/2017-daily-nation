Gor Mahia defender Godfrey Walusimbi says he cannot wait to compete at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. The left-footed, skilful dribbler is among two Kenyan Premier League players selected to compete at the biennial continental football showpiece slated to begin in Gabon on January 14. The 27-year-old was named together with Shafique Batambuze by coach Milutin Sredojevic in Uganda Cranes final squad for the Nations Cup on Wednesday night. “For us Ugandans, this chance comes once in our lifetime. I cannot wait to play there and make some piece of history. I am in good shape and we have been preparing well,” said Walusimbi. He added: “Of course, I would not have been there had it not been for the support from my teammates at Gor Mahia and the competitiveness in the Kenyan league.” Walusimbi, who has been a regular starter for the Uganda Cranes over the past four years, is now set to rub shoulders with the continent’s best players. Uganda are in Group D with Ghana, Mali and Egypt. Other players in Uganda’s squad include Belgium-based forward Farouk Miya, Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Dennis Onyango, plus ex-Gor Mahia midfielders Khalid Aucho and Geoffrey “Baba” Kizito.

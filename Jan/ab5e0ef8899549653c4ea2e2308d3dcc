Fourteen people have died after a matatu plunged into a ditch in Nyakach in Kisumu County. County Commissioner Mohamed Maalim confirmed that the crash happened at around 7:15am, blaming it on overloading. At the time, 11 died on the spot while seven injured were taken to Pap Onditi Sub-County Hospital for first aid before being transferred to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital for further treatment. "This is a confirmation that the matatu was overloaded and we expect a thorough investigation to be conducted into how an overloaded matatu could travel all the way from Sirare," Mr Maalim told the Nation.   The public service vehicle, registration number KBW 624 F, was heading to Kisumu from Sirare. The accident occured at Nyalunya. Three more died later in the day.

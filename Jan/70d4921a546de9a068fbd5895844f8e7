The new format adopted by the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) that provides for an 18-team tournament has finally ended the impasse on how matches ought to be organised. Arguably, the 18-team format has advantages, among others, ensuring strong grassroots representation and debunking the myth that talent only abounds in the cities. This should help improve soccer standards, hence widening the scope for national team selection. Having cleared the uncertainty that bedevilled the league for nearly a decade, the two bodies must now focus on giving the country quality championships. For a start, the ruckus over the relegation of Muhoroni Sugar, Sofapaka and Thika United from the KPL after they failed to comply with the new rules by the Confederation of African Football must be quickly addressed so that everyone is clear about who will participate in the championship. Indeed, the sitting planned for Wednesday to arbitrate over the case must resolve the matter judiciously. Secondly, the football managers must address themselves to financing the game through establishing partnerships, and that requires aggressive marketing to secure sponsors. Further, FKF must put in place a system for developing talent among the youth who hold the future of the game.

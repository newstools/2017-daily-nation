Protesters in Busia County have destroyed property in response to the killing of a boda boda rider by a police officer. Residents of Burinda torched a police pickup truck and four houses â€” three belonging to Administration Police officers and one to a chief. Western Regional Commander Moses Ombati said the rider had committed a traffic offence but refused to stop when an officer waved him down, prompting the officer to use a gun. The police boss said investigations were under way.

The Boni community in Lamu County has asked the government to employ qualified young people from Basuba Ward to teach in five primary schools closed three years ago. Teachers in Basuba, Milimani, Mangai, Mararani and Kiangwe primary schools fled in June 2014 following increased terrorist attacks. Basuba parents who spoke to the Nation on Thursday questioned the reasons for schools remaining closed despite improved security. Since September 11, 2015, Basuba Ward and its surroundings have been in a lockdown. The government launched a multi-security agency campaign called Operation Linda Boni to flush out Al-Shabaab terrorists from Boni Forest. More than 400 children have not been in school since then. Residents expressed disappointment that even after schools re-opened for first term this week, the five institutions in Basuba remained closed. EDUCATION COLLAPSING “Education officials say teachers posted to Basuba do not want to come because of insecurity. This place is very safe, especially after Operation Linda Boni began,” Aisha Gurba said. Musa Baishe, another resident, called on the government to reopen the schools. “Let Teachers Service Commission employ natives then. There many people here who have the training. Education is collapsing and there is need to save it,” Mr Baishe said. At Kiangwe Village, residents asked the government to close down a General Service Unit camp established at Kiangwe Primary School three years ago. They urged the government to move the camp elsewhere near the village and reopen the school.   TSC refuses to send teachers to region while county functionaries talk of transferring pupils.

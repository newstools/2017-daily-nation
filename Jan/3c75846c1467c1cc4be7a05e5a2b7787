A 40-year-old woman is lucky to be alive after she was brutally attacked with a panga by her lover in Thangathi, Mukurweini sub-county, Nyeri County. Ms Watiri Mwaniki was slashed more than five times on the head and face by her lover —a son of a local preacher — on Saturday evening after the couple engaged in a quarrel after a day-long drinking spree, according to their neighbour Mercy Wainaina. The assailant later fled the scene but police have launched a manhunt for him. The victim, a mother of two, was rushed to Mukurweini hospital by neighbours who responded to her distress calls. The hospital's Clinical Officer Winnie Njoki said she had deep cuts on the head, face and hands. "Her skull also suffered injuries and she was bleeding profusely. Her fingers were almost chopped off while her face was severely injured. All her clothes were bloody and she was even violent during treatment due to drunkenness," said Ms Njoki. The victim was later transferred to Tumutumu Mission Hospital Mathira for specialised treatment since there was no doctor at the sub-county health facility due to the ongoing strike. She was taken to the private hospital using a volunteer's pick-up vehicle after the relatives declined to follow procedures involved in getting an ambulance. However, Ms Njoki said the clinical officers were in charge and attending to more than 100 patients daily since the strike kicked off a month ago. "The hospital is operational and patients are getting services despite the strike," she noted.

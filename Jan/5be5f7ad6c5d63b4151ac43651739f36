A member of Parliament has appealed to police to investigate the high number of illegal firearms in Homa Bay County ahead of the elections. Kasipul MP Oyugi Magwanga said some politicians are arming youths to cause mayhem. He said he had reported the matter to police in the county but no action had been taken. However, Nyanza Regional Administration Police Commander Joseph Keitany said four suspects dealing in illegal firearms were apprehended in Kisii and are in police custody. He said the suspects would be charged in court. "Police are vigilant and investigations to arrest more suspects are ongoing," Mr Keitany said. Speaking to the Nation by phoneon Monday, County Police Commander John Omusanga told the MP to follow up the matter with him. Mr Magwanga has insisted that assassination plots are afoot. He said: "We have reported to the police that the proliferation of illegal firearms in the county is alarming. These firearms are designated for assassination missions." Mr Magwanga added that youths are being trained to join gangs in various parts of the region. He said the training is taking place in Kasipul, Karachuonyo North and Homa Bay town under the disguise of training watchmen. "The motive behind these trainings is to assassinate certain political opponents and intimidate their supporters," he said.

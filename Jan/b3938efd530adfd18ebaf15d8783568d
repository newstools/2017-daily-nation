Kenyan sportsmen and women usher in the new year with great expectations. After last year’s series of blunders in the management of the country’s sport, it was reassuring that President Uhuru Kenyatta, in his new year message, assured Kenyans that action would be taken against those found guilty of mismanaging Kenya’s preparations for and participation in last year’s Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games. That the President directed the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that investigations continued to their logical conclusion offers hope for the country’s long-suffering athletes. This is especially heartening because there are important assignments on the calendar this year. Kenya will host the prestigious IAAF World Under-18 Athletics Championships in Nairobi from July 12 to 16. However, there is concern about the slow pace of the preparations for the championships. A major overhaul of the competition venue at the Kasarani stadium has yet to start. Funds for organising this important global event have not been released, leading to concerns over whether Kenya is really serious about hosting the world in July. However, the sports fraternity remains hopeful that these concerns will be addressed. We wish our sportsmen and women a successful season in 2017.

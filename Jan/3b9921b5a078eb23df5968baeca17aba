Police have been ordered to arrest Nyandarua County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti for flouting court orders. Justice Stephen Radido of the Employment and Labour Relations court in Nakuru directed Inspector-General (IG) of Police Joseph Boinnet to execute an arrest warrant issued against Mr Kimiti on November 17, 2016. In his ruling, he gave state counsel Kiprotich Kirui five days to write a letter to the IG notifying him to arrest Mr Kimiti. Mr Kimiti had failed to appear in court to explain his delay in reinstating Lucy Wangari Methu, a chief who had been sacked. Through her lawyer Stanley Kihiko, Ms Methu petitioned the court to have the IG summoned to answer why the commissioner had not yet been arrested. "I request the court to summon the IG because we have enough evidence to show that his office had received the court orders but has done nothing about them," Mr Kihiko said. In a letter dated September 6, the chief was interdicted on allegations of gross misconduct and reinstated on October 26. She was accused of perpetrating hate speech via social media and engaging in active politics, which is illegal. The case will be mentioned on January 20.

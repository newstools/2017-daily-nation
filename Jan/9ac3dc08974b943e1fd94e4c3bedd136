Double tragedy struck a family in Vihiga County when two of its members were killed in a road accident on their way back to Kisumu after dropping off the body of their relative. The head-on crash between the hearse carrying them and a lorry at Ebuyangu on Monday evening also injured six other people, including the drivers of the two vehicles. The dead and three of the injured were part of a family group returning to Kisumu after delivering their relative's body to Ebuyangu. The injured were taken to Coptic Hospital while the two bodies were taken to the Dolphin mortuary. "The six [in the funeral group] were in the hearse that had just dropped [off] a body in Ebuyangu and was on its way back to the packing station," said Vihiga County Police Commander Sarah Duncan. She said initial investigations show the driver of the hearse was speeding.

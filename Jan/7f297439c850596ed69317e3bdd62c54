Former Anglican Church of Kenya head Eliud Wabukala will appear before the National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee on Thursday for vetting as chairman of the anti-corruption agency. Archbishop Wabukala accepted the nomination by President Kenyatta to be chairman of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). Should MPs approve his nomination, Mr Wabukala will replace Phillip Kinisu, who left under a cloud of controversy when it was discovered that his family's company had business dealings with the National Youth Service. The fact that Mr Kinisu’s firm — Esaki Ltd — won contracts with the NYS amounting to Sh35 million somehow escaped the scrutiny of the same committee during his vetting. UNDER INVESTIGATIONS The NYS is under investigation by the EACC and Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) over the loss of Sh791 million, which has since risen to Sh1.8 billion. Ol Kalou MP Muriithi Waiganjo, a member of the committee, confirmed that Mr Wabukala would appear before it, after which the PAC would have 14 days to prepare a report and table it in the House for debate. Parliament is expected to convene a special sitting on January 17 in which Mr Wabukala’s nomination as well as those of Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission members would either be approved or rejected. Given the intricate nature of corruption and the acrimonious manner in which heads of the EACC have left office, commentators say Mr Wabukala's new role could greatly damage his standing in society.   Parliament extends period for his vetting by 14 days.

A woman has withdrawn a case in which she was seeking to stop the burial of former nominated MP Mark Too. Fatuma Ramadhan Hassan had filed the case saying her son is Mr Too’s child and had been excluded from participating in his burial. Ms Hassan told the court that Mr Too's family had agreed to include her son in the burial arrangements. She said all other issues concerning inheritance and upkeep will be addressed during the distribution of Mr Too's estate. Lawyer Tom Ojienda, representing Mr Too’s family, told High Court Judge Aggrey Muchelule that the woman and her son will be allowed to attend the former nominated MP's a funeral service at AIC Milimani on Friday. In her lawsuit, Ms Hassan had said the future of her son’s education was uncertain as he was being supported by Mr Too. She said she had not been involved in the burial arrangements and had only learnt about them from the media.   A group of squatters have sought to be enjoined in a suit seeking to stop his burial.

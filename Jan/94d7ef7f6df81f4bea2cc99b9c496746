A group of businessmen from Namanga have lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta’s New Year message that called on youths to reject leaders who promote violence through protests. Speaking to the Nation on Monday in Kajiado County, Namanga Businessmen Association chairman Antony Baraza told President Kenyatta to ensure the country is peaceful ahead of the forthcoming General Election. “We cannot afford to throw this country to the dogs. It is known that anytime violence erupts those affected are us, the small business people. Some of us are forced to close our businesses and nobody bothers to support us,” Mr Baraza said. He said his association has resolved to promote peace. He urged Cord to find a better alternative to street protests when addressing political problems. “Kenyan politicians need to trade carefully in this [election] year. Simple acts like mass action can easily degenerate to fights, conflicts, deaths and huge losses to businessmen," he said. The traders also urged the government to support a friendly business environment.

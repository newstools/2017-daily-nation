A student from Bungoma County has won Sh1 million in a lottery. Josphat Mungai, 22, is one of the 10 winners announced by Pambazuka National Lottery. They participated in a holiday promotion that closed on New Yearâ€™s Day. The others include Francis Yenku, a butcher from Narok, and Robert Nyabiba, a water vendor. Paul Kinuthia, the firm's chief executive officer, said all the winners will be taught entrepreneurial skills in order to spend their winnings wisely. "The Holiday Jackpot has allowed us to award 10 winners Sh1 million ... each. "We are glad to be part of making their New Year better by changing their lives through this win," Mr Kinuthia said. A note on the company's website says it was established last year to "provide revenue-generating entertainment through the sale of an innovative lottery product that provides economic and social benefits to Kenyan as a whole". To play, one must be 18 years old and above.

“Why are you guys so hell-bent on burning Kenya?” flamboyant businessman Chris Kirubi asked me last Sunday. He was referring to the media in general and our “obsession” with negative news. “Your job as Brand Kenya board chairman is to profile the positive aspects of Kenya,” I told him. “But the job of those great people who work for you on the 19th floor of Lonrho House is to tell the truth.” We were walking along the corridors heading to the studio for an appearance on Dr King’ori’s comedy show, The Wicked Edition. Kirubi worries that Kenyan reporters produce too many critical stories and not enough that chronicle successes, especially in the government. I countered that there is often a shortage of those uplifting stories, or that they even get swamped by a steady flow of everything that is going wrong. It was a philosophical conversation but one that goes to the heart of how different people perceive information. Veteran international correspondent and CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour advocates for truth, not neutrality. “There is a difference here,” she explained to comedian Trevor Noah on The Daily Show last July. “Truthful is bringing the truth. Neutral can be creating a false equivalence between this side and that.” BLAMING THE MEDIA My conversation with Kirubi occurred just a day after I interviewed Senate Majority Whip Beatrice Elachi on the passage of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill. She took issue with my characterisation of the debate around the bill as controversial. Even though there had been great public acrimony about the proposed changes and they were pushed through despite strong opposition by Cord, she didn’t think they’re controversial. “I want the media to help this country,” she implored directly to the camera. “Media, I am begging you because politicians can burn a country and yet you have an opportunity to read.” Politicians love to blame the media and other politicians for misinformation or dangerous speech, but never themselves. Even more fascinating is how the interview was received. “Larry you’re pushing so that she contradicts herself, it seems you support your Baba,” wrote one Daniel Kamau on YouTube. “Media can build or destroy a country; tell Kenyans what is right [and] stop supporting politicians.” But one John Juma saw it differently: “This is the most useless conversation from a senator I have heard, she is contradicting herself all through.” There were plenty of similar comments across social media, falling almost uniformly along one side or the other of those two arguments. It seems that most viewers watched the interview with a particular mindset and either accepted what she said, or totally rejected it. FACTS NO LONGER MATTER In 2017, facts no longer matter and everyone has their own, firmly held version of the truth. Confirmation bias has always been a fallacy in argumentation in academic circles but this is the year it enters mainstream application. As Brand Kenya Board chairman, Kirubi is a full-time public face of Kenya, especially to the outside world. He is an establishment man, an unshakable supporter of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his administration, no matter what. Even though a media owner himself, he is likely to see reporting on the government’s failings as harmful, even though they are in the public interest. If you take away politics, Kirubi is engaging and iconoclastic as he was on the comedy show. He amplifies messaging that paints the government in good light, but at least he is a direct beneficiary of it. On the other side of the political spectrum there are just as many who see Raila Odinga and his coalition as infallible. They read mischief in every action and are ready to lay down their lives for the former prime minister and his movement. They seek out information and voices that reinforce what they already believe and dismiss anything that doesn’t sit well with their point of view. Because they are almost evenly matched in number with diehard Jubilee fans, epic fights always break out in the comment section of any political content. Objectivity in the academic sense is irrelevant to these types because only their version of facts matter. That is why there are those who will immediately jump to the defence of Aden Duale when an unflattering tape surfaces, without allowing room for doubt if he really said those things. It is precisely because of this charged environment that journalists need to strive for truth, not necessarily neutrality. I have always called for vigorous debate on the issues that divide us, even though some consider that argumentative and needlessly confrontational. Most people expect us to present a false balance in the name of impartiality, a dangerous expectation in an age in which truth has become negotiable. Facts should never trump opinion.

He is a Stanford graduate and founder of the Egyptian private equity firm Citadel Capital, now Qalaa Holdings. They had investments under control of about $9 billion (Sh695 billion) at the time. “When we find an investment opportunity, we would invest 20-25 per cent of the equity of that deal and typically invite a group of investors to participate with us,” he told me. He had just acquired a 51 per cent stake in the troubled Rift Valley Railways concession. “There are no pies in the sky that fall. You need to invest and make sure that the management is right before you make money,” he added. This is why I was dismayed when I read in the Business Daily about massive fraud at Rift Valley Railways (RVR) uncovered by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) after it gave it a Sh2.2 billion loan. The audit found that RVR executives bribed public officials, manipulated accounts and created convoluted ownership and operational structures with the aim of defrauding lenders, including IFC,” wrote Victor Juma. The World Bank was considering sanctions against culpable individuals and the whole situation stank to high heaven. I wonder what Dr Heikal would make of this.  *** WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY The excitement about the inauguration of Ghana’s new president, Nana Akufo-Addo, 72, was on Saturday marred by a discovery that portions of his speech had been plagiarised. The incoming leader’s speechwriters had borrowed from at least three American presidents: Woodrow Wilson, George Bush and Bill Clinton. “I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character,” he said. It was lifted almost word for word from President Bush’s 2001 inauguration speech. Another portion was lifted from Clinton’s 1993 speech. “I unreservedly apologise for the non-acknowledgement of this quote to the original author,” the new leader’s communications director, Eugene Arhin, said on Facebook. Just a day earlier, a woman Donald Trump has tapped for a top national security communications role, Monica Crowley ,was found to have plagiarised more than 50 times in her 2012 book. When did people stop writing their own material and start stealing other people’s?             It is because of his antics that he is popular.

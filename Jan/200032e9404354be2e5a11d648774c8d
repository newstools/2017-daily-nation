Three students from Mombasa County who excelled in the 2016 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) might repeat the national examination after they failed to proceed to secondary schools. Mwangome Killian, who emerged the best student in Mlaleo Primary School with 399 points, was selected to join Kenyatta High School but her parents do not have enough money to pay for his fees. Consequently, they urged him to repeat. Similarly, Patience Shally,13, who got an admission letter from St Albert Girls Ulanda is in the same predicament. Shally was the top pupil at Hepida Junior School in Magongo with 371 marks. She aspires to study law. Her mother, Margaret Manga, said she hopes her daughter will be assisted to attend school. "I used to sell chang’aa to take her to school, but I was arrested. I can’t go back to that business again," Ms Manga said. Also, Abdhallah Laja,14, who attended Sparki Primary School in Mvita, has been told to go back and sit the exams. He scored 328 marks and was called to Allidina Visram High School. However, Florence Laja - his mother - said she cannot afford the Sh33, 174 amount required per year. "I am devastated after my hope to finish secondary education and later pursue journalism is now a dream due to lack of school fees. My mother has tried applying for bursaries but we never got any assistance," Laja said. Ms Laja said she pleaded with the administration to admit her son but she was told paying the required amount first is mandatory. The first born in a family of three said he is pained that his former classmates get to go to secondary school while he is locked out. He urged well-wishers to help sort out his situation.

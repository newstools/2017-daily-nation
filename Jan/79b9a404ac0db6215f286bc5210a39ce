Angry Kisumu youths on Wednesday smashed a vehicle carrying area MP Ken Obura, forcing him to flee the scene during a mass voter registration campaign. The youths stoned Mr Obura’s Toyota Land Cruiser at Kondele, accusing him of supporting President Kenyatta's Jubilee Party. They broke his vehicle’s rear and side windows. T-SHIRTS The Kisumu Central lawmaker was also chased away at Kibuye market, where he had gone to mobilise residents to register as voters. Motorcycle operators, who were wearing T-shirts bearing the MP’s name, removed them for fear of attracting the wrath of the irate group. Mr Obura, a first-time lawmaker, has been accused by residents of supporting the Jubilee administration though he won his seat on an ODM ticket.   The MP has also been criticised for his silence and absence from ODM rallies and activities in the region. However, Mr Obura downplayed the incident, calling it a minor issue. Briefing journalists after the incident, he accused his rivals of fanning violence against him. The unrelenting legislator also vowed to continue with the voter registration drive for the next one week. "My rivals who are new in politics are only trying some games on me," he said. "I want to see if they will sustain the disruption of my activities." Mr Obura was among ODM politicians who attended the Jubilee prayer rally in Nakuru last year presided over by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto.   Odinga concerned over poor voter registration in some polling stations he visited.

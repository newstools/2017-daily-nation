ODM lawmakers will support the nomination of Wafula Chebukati to head the electoral commission and six nominees for commissioner posts when the names are tabled in the House tomorrow. This is despite the National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee noting that most of the nominees lacked the requisite skills on electoral matters to competently manage the polls. ODM Secretary for Political Affairs Opiyo Wandayi on Monday said opposition MPs would support the nominees for appointment, adding that they are better than the current Issack Hassan-led commission. SAME REGION He said Kenya is between a rock and a hard place given that the General Election is less than seven months away and the commissioners must be in office to oversee voter registration and prepare for the polls. President Kenyatta received a list of two nominees for chairperson and nine for commissioners from the IEBC selection panel, and was expected to pick the chairperson and six commissioners within seven days. President Kenyatta settled on Mr Chebukati, leaving out Tukero ole Kina, who was widely viewed as the most appropriate nominee, given that current IEBC Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba comes from the same region as Mr Chebukati. ACCUSATIONS They both hail from Trans-Nzoia County. The other six are Consolata Nkatha Bucha Maina, Boya Molu, Roselyne Kwamboka Akombe, Paul Kibiwot Kurgat, Margaret Wanjala Mwachanya and Abdi Gilye. Members of the selection panel, chaired by Bernadette Musundi, have defended themselves against accusations that they disappointed Kenyans, saying the panel did not receive any reports that linked Mr Chebukati or Ms Maina to any legal or ethical wrongdoing.

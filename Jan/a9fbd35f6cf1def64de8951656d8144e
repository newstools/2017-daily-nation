Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has rallied the Luhya community to enlist as voters to give him a higher bargaining power to get the National Super Alliance (Nasa) presidential ticket. Mr Mudavadi told locals in Busia that at least five million need to register for him to be better placed to win the nomination and the General Election in August 8. "We need [to] raise five million votes to increase my bargaining power. Let’s ensure that 1.8 million unregistered voters register,” he said during a voter mobilisation rally. He said he is committed to see Nasa become a success. It is a formation of ODM, Wiper, Ford Kenya and ANC parties. "Nasa is the coalition I will use [ascend] to the presidency. ANC is the party I am using to be the Nasa candidate," he explained. The ANC leader addressed crowds in Budalang'i, Bumala, Nambale, Funyula and Busia Polytechnic. Furthermore, the Luhya spokesman emphasised that the coalition will remove the Jubilee administration from power. "All of us have agreed that if we want to send Jubilee home, we have to work together. This is the main purpose of Nasa. "Our message today [is] for people to register as voters and help us make Jubilee a one-term government," he continued. He also told the residents to collect their identity cards.

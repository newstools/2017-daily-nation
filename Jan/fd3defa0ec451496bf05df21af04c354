More than 150 pupils of a school in Isiolo are learning under trees after their classroom roofs were blown off in a storm last year. The roofs of five classrooms of Chumvi Yere Primary School, which were blown off in October last year, are yet to be replaced. Some of the pupils are learning under trees and others in temporary structures. Headteacher David Gichunge said the school appealed for help to the county government, the Education ministry and the Constituency Development Fund office but no one had responded. At least 14 solar panels that were installed for the digital literacy programme, batteries and the computer laboratory were also damaged in the storm. “The affected pupils who are learning under trees are exposed to risk since the area is windy and dusty. They cannot concentrate fully because the sun is very hot,” said Mr Gichunge. Peter Ekai, a parent, urged the government to intervene and reconstruct the classrooms to allow the pupils to learn in more conducive structures.

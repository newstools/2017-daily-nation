The national government has withdrawn bodyguards assigned to Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi. Governor Joho's Communications Director Richard Chacha confirmed that the guards were pulled. Leaders of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) in the Coast region planned to address a press conference concerning the matter. Reacting to the withdrawal of the officers, ODM director of elections Junet Mohammed said the party was shocked by these "acts of bullying that are meant to blackmail and arm-twist Governor Joho into supporting the failed Jubilee regime or to cow him into silence". Mr Mohammed said the actions, coinciding with President Uhuru Kenyatta's visit to Mombasa, are "illegal and unconstitutional and an abuse of office and power". "We demand the restoration of Mr Johoâ€™s security with immediate effect and we warn the National Government that we will hold it solely responsible for any misfortune and security breaches that may befall the Governor," said the Suna East MP. Bodyguards withdrawn on Saturday morning, ODM MPs said.

An ODM youth leader in Homa Bay County and four other suspects have been charged with murder. They appeared Tuesday before Homa Bay Resident Magistrate Lilian Ndegwa and denied the charges. However, prosecutor Dennis Shabolla requested the court to push the hearing to January 9 to allow investigators more time to conduct comprehensive investigations. Ms Ndegwa granted the request. The accused are still in police custody. Homa Bay Criminal Investigations Officer Joseph Tukisho told the Nation that Kevin Ouma and four accomplices were arrested on Sunday in a hotel room in Kisii County, where they were hiding after allegedly killing Jacob Ojwang', 32, two weeks ago. The others are Lavinus Ahero Kwasi, Samwel Okoth Ouma, David Kwash and Godwin Onano. "We managed to arrest Mr Ouma and his group after an ... investigation and operation conducted by our officers," Mr Tukisho said. The court appearance comes after Mr Ouma's shop in Homa Bay town was destroyed Friday by a fire started by unknown people. Five other shops also went up in flames. Homa Bay County Police Commandant John Omusanga said police were still pursuing other youths linked to criminal activities. Mr Omusanga said police are also investigating politicians in the county who are fanning crime. "We are currently investigating if politicians in Homa Bay County are associated with criminal gangs being accused of murder," he said.   Five adjacent shops also went up in flames in the 4am fire.

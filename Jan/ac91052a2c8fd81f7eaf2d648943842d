The resurgence of fires in schools, hardly two weeks after the institutions reopened for the new calendar year is a matter of grave concern. Four dormitories in four different schools went up in flames at the weekend in inexplicable circumstances. Even as police rally to get to the bottom of the infernos, these latest incidents evoke frightening memories of mid last year, when more than 100 schools were hit by the fires in a wave that elicited calls for the closure of all public schools to ensure the safety of the children. Mercifully, the fires died down and a number of students and teachers suspected of being behind the incidents were arrested and charged in court. These latest incidents, however, beg the questions: Is the country about to witness another inexorable cycle of fires in schools? Are children safe in boarding schools? Are these cases of arson or poor school infrastructure? And what happened to the team appointed last year to investigate school fires? Police need to work closely with school administrators to have the perpetrators seized and brought to book. Headteachers need to invest in strict security measures that would make it difficult for students to sneak petrol into the dormitories or for outsiders to enter the institutions and start the fires.

Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has refuted reports on the social media that he plans to leave Jubilee and return to ODM, the party he ditched in 2016. He described the Twitter reports that begun trending on January 18 as a malicious fabrication by his political enemies aimed at creating confusion among voters in the county for their own agenda. The report that appeared on Twitter read, “Jubilee promised us goodies but we have been short-changed. It’s never late to go back home for the interest of my people. Accept my apologies”. “The claims are false. They are manufactured by my political enemies who have sensed defeat in the Kwale governor’s [race]. But let me assure them that wananchi are with me and will re-elect me with overwhelming majority come August,” he said. Mr Mvurya, who was elected on ODM ticket in 2013, said he is firmly in Jubilee and will defend his seat on the party’s ticket. IGNORE THE LIES “They can peddle as many lies as they wish but truth is, I am firmly in Jubilee and will vie on its party ticket. I urge my supporters across Kwale to ignore the said social media reports and [look] ahead until we are re-elected. Victory is ours and do not worry at all,” he said, oozing with confidence. Mr Mvurya’s departure from ODM put a leadership crisis as it left no outright replacement in the county resulting to a scramble for a suitable candidate. Kenya’s Ambassador to Tanzania Chirau Ali Mwakwere was said to have been brought on-board to salvage the situation but he has not publicly declared if he is joining the party. Deputy Country Director for Plan International in Uganda Dr Issa Chipera and the county Speaker Sammy Ruwa are the other possible candidates to join ODM.

Holders A 1000 Street on Tuesday edged Nyoi FC by a solitary goal to storm the final of the annual Koth Biro Cup football tournament. Duke Odhiambo secured the all-important goal of this entertaining contest which was played out before a capacity crowd at the historic Ziwani grounds. Odhiambo composed himself amid close marking from two markers, and managed a fierce shot past Nyoi keeper Farouk Shikalo in the opening stanza, to decide the game. “The match became tougher than we anticipated, so we had to dig deep especially to protect the result in the second half. We will watch the other game (semi-final)and plan well for the final. Our target now is to retain the cup,” Odhiambo told Daily Nation Sport afterwards. Thus, A 1000 Street will now meet the winner of the other semi-final game pitting last year’s losing finalists Pumwani FC against Beirut in Sunday’s final. This last four match is slated for the same venue at 3pm on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the semi-final losers will contest the third play-off game on Saturday, with the final taking place on Sunday. In the game, A 1000 Street should have won by a more comfortable margin. That is if AFC Leopards-bound defender Robinson Kamura had managed to convert a headed corner with only Shikalo to beat.

Six police recruits from Kiganjo Police Training College have been charged in a Nyeri court with forging academic documents, a month to their graduation. The five men and a woman were also charged with presenting fake Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) certificates purporting to be genuine and issued by the Kenya National Examinations Council. Hussein Hassan Mohammed, Humphrey Otieno, Josephine Akinyi, Lucas Kasim Mutua, Ezra Ouma Were and Wilfred Mose appeared before Senior Resident Magistrate Nelly Kariuki. However, they did not take plea, after prosecutors applied to remand them for six days at the Nyeri Central Police Station to allow police to complete their investigations. The court heard that the recruits were arrested Thursday evening at the college and were yet to record statements. They are said to have forged KCSE certificates at unknown places and times in the country before joining the training college in May 2016. Some of them allegedly altered their academic grades while others never sat for the national examination. More than 3,500 police constables are scheduled to graduate before the end of March. The case will be mentioned on January 19.

Lands ministry has started loading its records to an electronic platforms as it seeks to digitise its services, Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has announced. Due to this, land rent clearance certificates, consent to transfer and charge and other related land administration processes will be disrupted at Ardhi House, Nairobi. “The current programme involves Correspondence Records registry and Nairobi central registry,” said Prof Kaimenyi. The process kicked off on Monday, January 9, 2017 and is set to go on to the following month when normal services will resume. “This is to notify members of the public that there will be minimal disruption of provision of services from January 9 to February 14,” said the notice on Sunday. In July last year, the Ministry carried out a similar process across 13 land registries in the country where services such as application and search for title deeds were digitised and now can be done through electronic transactions. The land registries which were digitized during the two-month process that ended in September last year were in Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Machakos, Kajiado, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, Bungoma, Meru, Thika, Kiambu and Central Registry at Ardhi house in Nairobi.

Legendary jockey, Pat Eddery, who died November 2015, aged 63, left his entire 1.3 million Sterling Pound estate, to stable girlfriend, Emma Owen. The Irishman has two daughters and two sons, contesting the Will. The 11-times champion rider, who won 4,632 races abroad during a span of 34 years, also graced Ngong turf with his expertise. Three Epsom Derby's and several l'Arc de Triomphe's, were among his thousands of accolades. Eddery stated that if Emma passed away before him, then the children would benefit. Otherwise not. Emma began working in Eddery's training yard 2009, causing a break-up of a previously happy three decade marriage to Carolyn. Most unfortunately, heavy alcohol consumption, led to the massive, premature, coronary heart attack, that ended an exceptional athlete's life.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has described the late Archbishop John Baptista Mugecha as an astute leader who defended the truth and was never swayed from his stand. In a press statement, the President described Archbishop Mugecha, the leader of the African Independent Pentecostal Church of Kenya (AIPCK), as a role model who acted and valued what was right and true and will be highly missed by the country. “He was forthright and direct. He was courageous and outspoken especially on matters of faith and values. “He will be remembered for upholding strong faith, and commitment to Christianity in the midst of wavering and changing traditions,” said President Kenyatta. He condoled with the family, friends and members of the church, praying to God to give them the strength and fortitude during the difficult moment. Archbishop Mugecha, the founder of AIPCK, died on Monday at Outspan Hospital Nyeri aged 72 after being admitted to the hospital on Wednesday last week. The cleric will be remembered founding the church, a splinter group of the Africa Independent Pentecostal Church of Africa (AIPCA), which he led for more than 30 years. The church was registered almost 13 years ago, after a 27-year dispute over the leadership of the church came to an end.

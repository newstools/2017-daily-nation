Police in Wajir have started escorting buses heading to Mandera to shield travellers from terrorist attacks. This is one of the steps security officers are taking to improve the safety of residents following a spate of attacks last year. People are being escorted from Tarbaj. The latest incident happened in Dagaxkut on December 23 when suspected Al-Shabaab militants attacked a construction camp, damaging a Safaricom mast and riddling a lorry and water tanker with bullets. No suspect was arrested. Tarbaj Deputy County Commissioner Andrew Mwiti said: "Our intelligence reports suggest that the attackers might have been locals and we are hunting them [down] to ensure that they face the law". Speaking to the Nation by phone, Mr Mwiti said security at border points had been beefed up. "Before, buses from Tarbaj to Mandera used to move without being escorted but after a series of attacks in the area, the latest being the December 23 incident, we decided to begin escorting the buses for the safety of our travellers," he said.

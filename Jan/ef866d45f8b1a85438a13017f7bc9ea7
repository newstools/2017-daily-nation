A judge has ordered the arrest of doctorsâ€™ union officials for failing to appear in court for sentencing after being found guilty of contempt. Justice Hellen Wasilwa on Tuesday asked police to arrest top officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) for skipping the court session. Judge Wasilwa said there was nothing she could do since the officials had not appeared before her as required. She asked the Kilimani police boss to enforce the order and ensure the officials appear in court. FOUND GUILTY Their case will be mentioned on January 12. On December 20, the Employment and Labour Relations Court found KMPDU Chairman Samuel Oroko, Secretary-General Ouma Oluga and others guilty of contempt. The other officials are Daisy Korir, Evelyne Chege, Allan Ochanji, Mwachonda Chibandzi and Titus Ondoro, according to the union. This was after the officials called a nationwide job boycott on December 5 against the court's orders. Justice Wasilwa's judgement followed a suit filed by the Council of Governors, which had obtained a court order stopping the industrial action that entered its fifth week today. QUALITY HEALTHCARE The arrest warrants against the union officials come a day after the Council of Governors ordered doctors to resume work on December 11 or face the sack. But in a quick rejoinder, KMPDU bosses said jail would not scare them in their quest for quality healthcare in Kenya. They said the arrest warrants amount to intimidation, adding that while they respect the court order, they might appeal the decision. Speaking at the Railways Club in Nairobi, they accused the government of using courts to intimidate them.  More to follow.

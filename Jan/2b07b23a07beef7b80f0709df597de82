The doctors’ rejection of a 40 per cent pay rise offered by President Uhuru Kenyatta to end their month-long strike means that there is no immediate end in sight to a crisis that has paralysed operations at the public hospitals countrywide. The doctors’ representatives are saying that nothing short of the full implementation of the 2013 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) will unlock the stalemate. Though they have eloquently argued that the CBA has more fundamental issues concerning medical practice than just the money, the same pact contains a 300 per cent pay rise. As he reached out to the doctors, the President made it clear that the prevailing economic conditions made it impossible to give in to their demands. We commend the President for intervening in search of a solution to this devastating standoff. The doctors should also be lauded for accepting the invitation to the talks. However, this latest turn of events dashes the hope of healthcare services resuming soon. While we appreciate the doctors’ concerns, it is obvious that adopting a hard-line stance is hardly the way to resolve this matter. In negotiations, each party must cede ground or else a pact will remain elusive. This impasse must be resolved to end the pain and agony in the public health sector.

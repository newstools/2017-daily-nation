Egypt qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals Wednesday with a 1-0 victory over Ghana in Port-Gentil. Roma attacker Mohamed Salah rifled a free-kick into the net on 11 minutes for a win that lifted his team to the top of the final Group D standings, one point ahead of fellow qualifiers Ghana. Egypt stay in Port-Gentil for a last-eight showdown with Morocco Sunday and Ghana face the Democratic Republic of Congo in Oyem the same day. On Saturday, Burkina Faso meet Tunisia and Senegal tackle Cameroon in the other quarter-finals.

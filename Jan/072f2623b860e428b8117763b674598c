Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya has cautioned his Mombasa counterpart Hassan Ali Joho against ‘persistent show of disrespect’ to President Uhuru Kenyatta. According to Mr Mvurya, Mr Joho’s relentless onslaught against the Jubilee administration “was a bad show and unbecoming of a leader.” Mr Mvurya, further, told the ODM deputy party leader to ‘learn’ how to respect the presidency and stop his attacks. Speaking in Kombani on Saturday while he issued bursaries to top students in the county, Mr Mvurya said the presidency is an institution which has to be respected by everyone regardless of power or wealth. The governor also warned politicians he said have been visiting his constituency to insult him to stop it, saying the County had no space for them. “If you want to get respect by a certain area, it will be reflected through its leaders. If you want to see a country respected, you must respect the President. You cannot keep on abusing President Kenyatta, he deserves respect. Kwale needs to be respected,” Mr Mvurya said in apparent reference to the Mombasa governor. “Kama haja yako ni kudhalilisha taasisi ya rais inaonekana kuna upungufu. Lakini sisi wa Kwale tuna hekima, (if your interest is to undermine the presidency, then it shows there is something lacking. But Kwale people have wisdom),” he added. He was referring to Mr joho’s utterances on Thursday during the commissioning of a water drainage project in Bamburi and a footbridge in Buxton by the President. Governor Joho had lambasted the Jubilee administration of taking credit for some projects initiated before they took over power to hoodwink the electorates into re-electing them. In his speech, Mr Joho challenged the national government over the funding of some of the projects and to show the residents those projects it had initiated in the area. Days later, his security detail and that of his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi was withdrawn.   President Kenyatta launched three mega projects worth Sh 3.2 billion.

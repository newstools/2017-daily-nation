The Lands ministry is set to kick off a process of digitising all land records in the country as it embarks on training staff on using computers. The ministry’s Communication Officer Joseph Mwangi said Sh.5.3 million has been set aside to train 3,000 staff on information and communication technology, management and technical skills ahead of a reorganisation exercise starting January 15. “The reorganisation will address the issue of missing information and lost files. The move will help reduce fraud and forgery and ensure there is effectiveness in service delivery,” said Mr Mwangi by phone Thursday. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta support the land reforms and digitisation of the services. However, staff at the Lands registries oppose the digitisation process. They said manual systems should not be destroyed but be maintained instead as back-ups, citing possible failure of electronic machines. Nyeri County Land registrar Jonah Mwambia said there are cases of fraud and forgery, citing a case in Narumoru, where three people are claiming ownership of a piece of land. “Last week three people presented green cards, each claiming to be the genuine owner of one piece of land in Narumoru. "We are investigating the matter. Police are also working with us in fighting falsification of land documents,” said Mr Mwambia. “With digital systems, it will be easy to ascertain land records,” he said.

A businessman has sued a member of Parliament he claims insulted President Uhuru Kenyatta. Philip Njuguna Waruthi, through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, seeks under a certificate of urgency to have Mbita MP Millie Odhiambo-Mabona restrained from uttering derogatory words against the President. He says the MP denigrated and insulted the Presidency in the National Assembly on December 20 in flagrant violation of Article 131(1) (e) of the Constitution, which describes a President as a symbol of unity. Mr Waruthi, who is seeking the Kandara parliamentary seat in Murang’a County in the 2017 elections, said Ms Odhiambo-Mabona violated her parliamentary privilege and immunity and thus cannot use them in her defence. He also demanded that the opposition MP apologise to the President within 48 hours upon the issuing of a court order by Justice Roselyn Aburili. PERMANENT INJUNCTION Mr Waruthi wants the court to issue a permanent injunction against Ms Odhiambo-Mabona barring her from saying anything that may injure the reputation of the Presidency. Ms Odhiambo-Mabona allegedly uttered unprintable abusive words against President Kenyatta when MPs were recalled by the National Assembly Speaker to debate amendments to election laws. Mr Kinyanjui said in the suit papers that the MP uttered the alleged demeaning and abusive utterances in contravention of her oath of office as a public officer. The aspiring parliamentarian claimed the words allegedly uttered by the MP, which were reportedly broadcast on social media and some TV stations, insinuate the Presidency to be that of a “mshenzi”, a Kiswahili word for an uncouth person.   Women leaders give MP 24 hours to apologise to the Head of State and Kenyans.

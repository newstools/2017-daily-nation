LONDON Paul Clement became Premier League bottom side Swansea's third manager this season when he was appointed on Tuesday. The 44-year-old Englishman — whose mentor Carlo Ancelotti described him as 'one of the most dynamic and intelligent coaches' — signed a two-and-a-half year contract after German champions Bayern Munich, where he was assistant coach, allowed him to talk with Swansea. Clement, whose only previous job as a manager was with second tier Derby, will attend Tuesday's relegation clash with Crystal Palace but watch from the stands as first team coach Alan Curtis will take charge.

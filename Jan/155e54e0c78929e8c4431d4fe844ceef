Former Judiciary chief registrar Gladys Boss Shollei will contest for the woman representative's seat in Uasin Gishu County. Mrs Shollei said she wants the position in order to push new laws and improve the lives of the residents. "When I relocated from Nairobi to this county to engage in farming, I interacted with several residents. "I noticed that there are a lot of challenges facing farmers in our county but the solution to these issues is only through the Parliament," she added. She lamented that current laws do not safeguard farmers' interests. "When you go to our supermarkets, you will find them flooded with agricultural produce such as fruits and tomatoes from South Africa and other countries — how we will make money to support your families?” She was speaking during a function at her home in Plateau, Uasin Gishu, on Monday. On why she chose the seat over the Senate one, she said: "The position of women representative is powerful. If you look at my friend Florence Kajuju (Meru woman rep), she has pushed for the allocation of money for miraa to aid farmers," she added. But she has not yet announced on which party she will vie for the seat. Mrs Shollei was hounded out of the Judicial Service Commission on allegations of funds misuse.

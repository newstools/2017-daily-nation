As US President Barack Obama’s eight-year tenure draws to a close, the most enduring lesson for Africa is the need to build strong and credible institutions. The transition, as always happens, is going on seamlessly with President-elect Donald Trump set to be sworn in on January 20. The controversy over his largely unexpected victory and claims about Russian involvement to influence the result have not overshadowed the build-up to the inauguration. For Mr Obama, it’s been a nostalgic moment looking back on his election in 2008 as the first African-American President and winning his second term in 2012. He leaves office happy about his achievements, but also aware that his Republican successor will attempt to undo some of his legacy. The most significant is, of course, “Obamacare”, the signature health policy that gave access to health insurance for millions of Americans. Mr Obama and Mr Trump are not the best of friends, the latter having been heavily involved in the so-called “birther movement” that unsuccessfully sought to remove the outgoing President from office on claims of not having been born in America. The crucial message to Africa is that, in a democratic system, rivalry and change of leadership need not be a source of national instability. Leaders come and go but the country remains.

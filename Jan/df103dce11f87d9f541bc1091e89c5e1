Isiolo deputy OCS Oscar Situma was found dead in his house on Friday. The police inspector’s body was found lying on the bed at his house in Isiolo town at 10am. Isiolo County Commissioner George Natembeya confirmed the death. The officer was based initially at the Merti Police Station and was recently transferred to the Isiolo Police Station. “He was to travel home as he had asked for seven days off beginning January 5 this year, since he was on duty during the festive season,” said Mr Natembeya. He said a police officer had seen him the previous day. “Another officer had seen him enter his house Thursday night — that’s how we found out about his death,” added the Commissioner. Mr Situma's body was taken to the Kiirua Hospital Mortuary in Meru County.

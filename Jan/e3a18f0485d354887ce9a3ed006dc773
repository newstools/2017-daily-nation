Rowdy youth Friday booed Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo, nearly disrupting President Uhuru Kenyatta’s effort to urge supporters to register as voters. Waving placards, the youth who positioned themselves in front of President Kenyatta’s motorcade heckled Mr Doyo forcing him to cut short his speech. They also refused to be addressed by Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko. President Kenyatta was forced to intervene to calm the crowd who kept on shouting “Doyo must go”. Interestingly, some of the hecklers wore T-shirts emblazoned "Doyo Tena (Doyo once again)". President Kenyatta later held a closed door meeting with Isiolo leaders at the Isiolo Airport where he is said to have called for tolerance. Addressing the rally near KCB in Isiolo Town, the President urged locals to register as voters in large numbers. Isiolo and Mandera are the only counties in northern Kenya whose governors were elected on Jubilee coalition ticket in 2013 elections.

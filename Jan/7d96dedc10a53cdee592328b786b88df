A Kitui senatorial aspirant has urged the Kamba community to support Kalonzo Musyoka's bid for the presidency on a Cord ticket. Enoch Wambua said the Wiper Party leader requires considerable support in order to become the opposition coalition's flag-bearer. He spoke on Saturday at the Kyuso playgrounds in Mwingi North constituency. He urged voters to elect him as the next Kitui County senator on a Wiper ticket. "Kalonzo (Musyoka) is our best shot at the presidency and we cannot afford to fool around this time round. We must, however, strengthen our voting muscle first as we seek to clinch the countryâ€™s top leadership. "I, therefore, beseech all persons of age within Kitui, Makueni and Machakos counties to register as voters so as to overwhelmingly vote Kalonzo into State House during the approaching polls," he urged. Mr Wambua is a former Standard Group managing editor.

LOS ANGELES Russell Westbrook notched the 60th triple-double of his career in the Oklahoma City Thunder's 114-105 victory over New Orleans on Wednesday to pass Larry Bird for fifth place on the all-time list. Westbrook posted 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists to fuel the Thunder with his 23rd triple-double of the season and his second in three victories over the Pelicans this season. Bird amassed his 59 triple-doubles in a 13-year NBA career, starring with the Boston Celtics from 1979-92. "I didn't watch much, but I know he was a good player," Westbrook said of Bird. "Obviously, he's a legend for a reason." "It's an honour, man," Westbrook, 28, added. "I never take this game for granted to play the game I love every night and to be able to do that is a great accomplishment. The path just to get to where I'm at is an honour that I don't take for granted." Despite Westbrook's effort — and another early injury exit for Pelicans star forward Anthony Davis — New Orleans challenged until the end. Oklahoma City led by 22 points in the second half but withstood a 9-0 Pelicans scoring run in the fourth quarter that cut the deficit to 105-100 with 5:33 remaining. Davis reinjured his right thigh late in the second quarter and finished with eight points and five rebounds. Guard E'Twaun Moore paced the Pelicans with 18 points.   James scored 24 points with 13 rebounds and 11 assists in defeat.

The government Thursday appeared to revise its offer to doctors to end their strike by extending the time for resolving labour issues from 60 to 90 days. Full page adverts in the dailies by the Health ministry said the government is ready to negotiate and conclude a CBA “within 60 days from the return to work date” even as the strike clocks its 40th day on Friday. Had the doctors accepted the ministry’s proposed return-to-work deal, it would have been concluded by the parties within 90 days “from the date thereof, but in any case, not later than April 15”. The deal would also be signed by devolved units and would form “part and be incorporated in the comprehensive CBA (for 2017-2021) when signed and registered in court”. It would see the highest earning doctor — a specialist — take home a maximum of Sh582,980 and the lowest — an intern — receive a maximum of Sh208,236. The government also extended non-monetary benefits, including mortgages, car loans and training. The doctors have rejected the deal, demanding the government register and implement the 2013 agreement. This would have seen a salary increase of between 70 and 200 per cent, among other perks and improved working conditions. State House has dismissed a story circulating in social media networks by a publication—The Telegraph India—that India has eluded a proposal from Kenya to fly out its doctors to fill the gap of striking doctors. This is a day after President Uhuru Kenyatta met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in bilateral talks. Mr Manoah Esipisu told the Nation the story is completely false and is based on speculation. “There is nowhere that the story quotes the Indian Prime Minister who would have responded directly. "The President’s trip to India was to seek transfer of medical innovation and cheaper drugs for our people not to get doctors,” he said.

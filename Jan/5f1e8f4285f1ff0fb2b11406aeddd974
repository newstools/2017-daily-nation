Elders in Wajir County have resorted to secret ballot to pick flag bearers for various political seats following a fallout in one of the sub-clans. Mohamed Zuber, a sub-clan of the populous Ogaden, on Monday used secret ballot to settle on a parliamentary candidate for Wajir South. This followed concerns over family divisions, where two cousins - Dr Mohamud Omar and Mr Ali Ahmed - had shown interest in the seat. Dr Omar, who emerged the winner in the nomination, said he was hopeful the entire community will endorse him. “I have been nominated by the Mohamed Zuber community of Wajir South and I am hopeful of being endorsed by the entire community,” he said. The unique nomination comes after a section of Fai sub-clan members denounced the Fai Sultanate endorsement of the Kenyan ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammed Abdi Mohamud to vie for the Wajir gubernatorial seat. Ambassador Mohamud’s close rival, Ugas Sheikh Mohamed, was asked to contest for Wajir East parliamentary seat replacing Mr Rashid Kassim who had earlier been picked by the sultanate. The ambassador will be vying on a Jubilee ticket. Mr Mohamed and Mr Kassim - whose endorsements were overturned - have however rejected the Sultanate’s verdict. Mr Mohamed, who had been endorsed in July 2016 for governorship, called on the residents to vote for him despite the decision by the elders to throw him out of the race. Mr Kassim, who the elders had picked to vie for Wajir East MP in July, vowed continue with his campaigns. The pair said nothing is going to stop their quest for political power. However, they are required to pay a fine of Sh1.5 million for defying the Sultanate’s verdict. Various clans and sub-clans in the county have been racing against time to endorse their candidates ahead of the General Election in what is described as negotiated democracy. Recently Wajir East MP Abbas Sheikh Mohammed was also endorsed by his Massare community for a second term.

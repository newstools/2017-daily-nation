A former member of Parliament has died. Peter Mutua Kavisi, who was the MP for Mwala constituency in Machakos County, was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital in Machakos Town on Friday night. He was at his home in Mwaasua Village. He was elected on a Kanu ticket in 1992 and served until 1997, when he lost his re-election bid. Former President Daniel Moi then appointed him commissioner in the Davy Koech-led commission of inquiry into the education system in 1999. Prior to joining politics, he was the executive secretary of the Kenya National Union of Teachers. Daniel Muoki, who also served as Mwala MP between 2007-2013, confirmed the death. He described Mr Kavisi as an outgoing person. "He was pro-people. And even after his tenure as an MP you would find him interacting with his people at a local market," he said. His body was taken to Montezuma Funeral Home in Machakos Town. Mr Kavisi is survived by three wives and six children.

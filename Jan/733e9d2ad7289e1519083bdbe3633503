Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok on Wednesday reshuffled chief officers in key ministries. Among them is the water department, which has faced criticism water scarcity in both rural settlements and major towns like Lodwar, Kakuma and Kalokol. In Lodwar, residents of Nakwamekwi location last month took to the streets and even went to the governor's office and ministry of water to air their grievances. Governor Nanok appointed Joseph Namuar the chief officer for water. He was previously in the department economic planning. Paul Ekutan has been moved to the department of trade, tourism and industrialisation as the chief officer. Mr Ekutan replaced Mathew Logurale, who will now be in charge ofÂ economic planning. "I have also appointed Mr Norbert Okumu, an advocate of the High Court, as my legal adviser and Mr Joseph Imoni as my new political adviser," said Mr Nanok. In September last year, the county boss sacked former Turkana Central MP Immanuel Imana, who was serving as his political adviser and peace ambassador, for working with Jubilee-affiliated leaders.

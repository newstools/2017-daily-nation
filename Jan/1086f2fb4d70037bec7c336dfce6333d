Geoffrey Kung’u of Nyandarua County has won a Sh100 million Lotto jackpot. Mr Kung’u, 40, who hails from Kirima village in Rurii Ward, near Ol Kalou, was announced winner in the Lotto Shinda Mamili Charity draw on New Year’s Eve. The small-scale farmer could not hide his joy when he learnt he had won the cash. “I was in the house with my wife when I learnt that I had won the Sh100 million. At first l did not believe it,” he told the Nation at his home on Sunday morning. “I jumped up and shouted, ‘A hundred million’, to the shock of my little children, who could not comprehend what was going on,” said the father of two. He revealed that it was his first time participating in such a game and was encouraged when he won the first Sh200 and Sh250 in the month of November and December, respectively. “I started participating in October and continued on a daily basis when I could afford it,” he said. Mr Kung’u said he will sit down with his family and deliberate on how to invest the millions. “I am not in a hurry because this is a lot of money and I have to plan wisely,” he said. “I will sit down with my family and get the best advice before I invest the amount. We all know that not many people have the privilege to budget for Sh100 million. I pray to God to help me and my family spend it wisely,” he explained. He, however, said he will use part of the money to expand his farming. The draw required participants to spend only Sh50 per entry, with the jackpot at Sh100 million.

Nurses in Taita-Taveta called off their strike on New Year’s Eve after reaching an agreement with the county government. The industrial action commenced in early December last year, with eight children and three expectant women dying at various hospitals as it went on. The Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) ended the strike after signing a return-to-work formula following talks with Governor John Mruttu and county health officials in Voi. Speaking to the Nation after signing the deal, county Knun Secretary Boniface Mrashui said officials promised to improve medics' working conditions. Mr Mrashui said the officials had addressed some of their grievances concerning unpaid allowances. “We had lengthy negotiations with county government officials concerning our welfare. We came into an agreement over some of the issues and that is why we have decided to suspend the strike,” he said. MONTHLY ALLOWANCES He said the nurses will resume duty immediately. “This is a New Year gift to our people. We regret their suffering,” he said. Under the agreement, county officials stated they will ensure all nurses are paid their monthly allowances on time. The officials also agreed to convene quarterly meetings with county union officials to brief them on issues regarding nurses and their working environment. The county also agreed to hire more nurses as a way of improving the nurse-to-patient ratio. The Public Service Board also promised to issue promotion letters starting on January 3. Acting health services chief officer John Logedi said some nurses had received allowances in their December salaries while others will be paid this month. He said the county had hired 36 new nurses, who will report to their stations on January 3.

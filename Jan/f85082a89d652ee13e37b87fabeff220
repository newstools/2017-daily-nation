Sofapaka, Thika United and Muhoroni Youth have paid the high price of failing to comply with Caf Club Licensing rules, with Football Kenya Federation announcing their demotion from the top-tier league on Monday. Federation president Nick Mwendwa, at a press briefing at Kandanda House, said the three had failed to meet the basic requirements as outlined by the Club Licensing Rules. This year's SportPesa Premier League, said Mwendwa, will consist of 15 teams. Thika, Sofapaka and Muhoroni, however, have a chance to participate in the National Super League in the 2017 season should they beat the January 31 deadline for the second-tier league. The deadline for Caf Club Licensing rules was December 16 last year. The teams were required to submit their documents by that date but the NEC extended the time to December 23. All the 14 KPL clubs submitted their documents within the December 23 window.

As the voter registration gets underway, youth organisations in Nairobi County are sensitising young people on the importance of voting. The Youth Congress has launched a youth awareness project to mobilize eligible young people across the country to register as voters. The initiative dubbed #VijanaTutokelezee is expected to help increase the number of youth registering as voters to participate in the 2017 polls. Speaking at Huruma slums in Nairobi, Youth Congress Chair Raphael Obonyo, said the action is aimed at preparing youth to be responsible citizens by participating in elections. According to Mr Obonyo due to lack of information, many young people are left out of the electoral process. “Youth are by far the largest component of Kenya’s population and voters. Given that 78 percent of the Kenyan population is below 35 years old, the nature or youth participation is essential. Civic awareness initiative like #VijanaTutokelezee would enlighten young people on the ins and outs of the Constitution, the democratic and electoral processes, and the government. The Initiative will provide much-needed teaching, reflection, and understanding of the complex elements of Kenya’s elections and governance system” he said. Obonyo said robust civic education and awareness is required to help the youth realize that elections have a significant impact on Kenya’s political, economic development and reforms. “The initiative will create space and a common platform for young people to put themselves and their issues at the Centre of the 2017 elections - it calls for youth to participate fully in all efforts in the 2017 elections,” he noted.

A former aide to Cord leader Raila Odinga has told him to stop interfering with matters concerning the next leader of Kibra constituency or risk losing a chance of being president. Mr Eliud Owalo said Mr Odinga should focus on his bid for presidency and not dabble in Kibra politics. Mr Odinga's daughter, Rosemary, wants to be the next MP for the area which is currently under Ken Okoth. "Raila Odinga should choose between Kibra Constituency and the Presidency. He will not get both at the same time," Mr Owalo wrote on his Facebook page today. Mr Owalo had last year petitioned Mr Odinga over what he claimed to be a plot to hand his daughter the ODM ticket for the seat. Mr Owalo also intends to contest for the seat. "The Juvenile misplaced excitement and unparalleled sycophancy exhibited in Kibra Constituency today in relation to the imposed parliamentary candidature of Rosemary Odinga may as well turn out to be Raila Odingaâ€™s waterloo in his quest for the Presidency," the post continued. Ms Odinga was in Kibra today mobilising locals to register as voters. However, Mr Owalo's statements have been termed by Uriri Parliamentary aspirant Bernard Omondi Gwonyo as a portrayal of panic. "Why is Owalo in a panic mode? Why can't he be man enough and face Rosemary at the ballot?" To quell anxiety, Mr Odinga has on several occasions assured aspirants that the nominations will be free and fair.

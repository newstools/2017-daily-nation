An 80-year-old man was lynched in Tharaka-Nithi County over claims that he stole chickens. Mugo Muga of Kamwangu village was killed by a mob early Friday. Maara OCPD John Njihia said the man was cornered by villagers at Sophia Kendi’s home after she raised the alarm. “According to a neighbour, [Mr Muga] was found in Ms Kendi’s compound and was hacked to death,” said Mr Njihia. The body was taken to Chuka County Referral Hospital. John Mutembei, a resident, told journalists that the man has a history of breaking into people’s houses to steal household items such as utensils and beddings. “It was not the first time the man was found stealing such things from his neighbours’ houses,” said Mr Mutembei. The OCPD warned locals against killing suspects, saying it is a crime and anyone found culpable will face the full force of the law. “Suspects are handed over to police so that the due process of law can be followed,” said Mr Njihia.

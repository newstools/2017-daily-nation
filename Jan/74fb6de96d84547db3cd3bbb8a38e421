Kenyans have been asked to present their views on the suitability of the nominees for positions in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) before vetting by Parliament. The National Assembly’s Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, chaired by Samuel Chepkonga (Ainabkoi), has started assessing whether the nominees indeed qualify for appointment to the positions. President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated lawyer Wafula Chebukati for the position of chairman, leaving out Mr Tukero ole Kina, who was widely viewed as the appropriate nominee, given that current IEBC Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba comes from the same region as Mr Chebukati. The President received a list of two nominees for the chairman position and nine for the commissioner slots. He was expected to pick the chairman and six commissioners within seven days, to replace the outgoing team led by Issack Hassan. NOT THE BEST CANDIDATE Already, queries have been raised about the suitability of Mr Chebukati following revelations that other candidates performed better than he did him in the interviews. “The marks in the public domain show that the chairman nominee was not the best candidate. “This raises serious concerns of undue influence,” said Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr. The President also nominated Consolata Nkatha Bucha Maina, Moya Molu, Roselyne Kwamboka Akombe, Paul Kibiwot Kurgat, Margaret Wanjala Mwachanya and Abdi Guliye as members of the electoral agency. Mr Chebukati will appear first before the parliamentary committee for vetting on January 10. The other three nominees will be vetted the following day. The National Assembly is on recess, but members will be recalled for a special sitting to consider the committee report after the vetting. Members of the public can submit their views through affidavits by close of business on January 9.   Religious leaders have said that hate mongers should not be on the ballot.

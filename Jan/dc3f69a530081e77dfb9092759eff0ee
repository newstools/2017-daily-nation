Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has told the opposition Cord to keep off debates on the Sh9.2 billion set aside to mitigate ongoing drought. This follows claims on social media that the government is scheming to steal public funds. “The opposition’s interest is to see Kenyans die so that they have something to say. Immediately it happens, they will go round saying that the government is irresponsible,” he said. Speaking in Laikipia County while commissioning a Sh7 million borehole, Mr Kiunjuri said the government is committed to feeding every Kenyan facing starvation. More than two million Kenyans face hunger as a result of poor rainfall being experienced in the country. He noted that the Jubilee administration is accountable and every shilling set aside for mitigating drought effects will be used prudently. “We care about the lives of Kenyans. Our priority is to ensure every affected area in Kenya receives water and food,” he noted. CONCERTED EFFORTS He noted that tackling drought needs concerted efforts between counties and the national government. He challenged every opposition leader challenging the Jubilee development record to account for what they did when they served in government. He termed them selfish leaders. “Please do not play with drought and the lives of Kenyans but because you have the habit of politicising every, you can continue,” he told the opposition leaders. He further warned them against inciting their supporters and politicising development projects launched by the Jubilee administration. Mr Kiunjuri said the National Supper Alliance (Nasa) is doomed to fail saying its members do not deserve to rule. “None of them deserve to rule anywhere because they are nothing but lords of poverty. They are enemies of development who will take Kenya back,” he said.

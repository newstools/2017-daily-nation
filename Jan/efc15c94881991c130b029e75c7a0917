Eldoret lawyer Simon Lilan has resurfaced nine days after he went missing from Eldoret town. Mr Lilan disappeared days after attempting to stop the burial of former nominated MP Mark Too. In an interview with NTV on Friday night, Mr Lilan said he went into hiding after he realised that his life was in danger and that he was not getting help from the police. “After Mark Too died I moved to court and obtained orders stopping his burial. This is when two vehicles started trailing my car and I and my elder brother John Talam who happens to be my driver could notice that the occupants were not up to any good. That is when I started feeling insecure, and after that some senior politicians started calling me imploring me to withdraw the case. They wanted me to withdraw the case,” said Mr Lilan. Mr Lilan said that he had been in hiding, seeking asylum from some foreign embassies and civil rights organisations. “At some point I was toying with the idea of leaving the country but I thought if I leave the country now what I have started will never come to light and mine is to know if Mark Too was assassinated because he never told me that he was sick,” he said. Mr Lilan claims Mark Too was assassinated for his vast wealth and political reasons and still demands that the mystery behind the death be investigated. Mr Too died on New Year’s Eve at St Luke's Orthopaedic and Trauma Hospital in Eldoret of what doctors said were heart-related complications. He had obtained a court order stopping the burial, but the burial went on after Mr Too’s family obtained another order allowing them to proceed with the ceremony.   Simon Lilan’s elder brother John Talam says the family has not seen him since Monday.

Chief Justice David Maraga will tour the Nakuru, Molo, Kabarnet and Eldama Ravine law courts on Tuesday and Wednesday. During his visit, the CJ will inaugurate High Court stations and inspect projects. On Monday, Justice Maraga is expected to inaugurate the Narok High Court. Rift Valley Law Society of Kenya's Nakuru chapter chairman Frank Mwangi on Monday told the Nation that the CJ will also meet various court users during the three-day tour of the region. “The Chief Justice will inspect the Nakuru law courts buildings, whose construction is under way before proceeding to the Molo, Kabarnet and Eldama Ravine law courts,” said Mr Mwangi. LAWYERS' CONCERNS A source told the Nation that the CJ is also expected to address various concerns raised by lawyers in the region late last year during his tour of the region. Lawyers in the South Rift had in November asked Justice Maraga to increase the number of judges handling environment, land, employment and labour relations matters in the region. They said the region has the highest number of land-related matters and needs more judges to help clear the backlog. They said the shortage of judicial staff had stalled the hearing of crucial matters. The lawyers petitioned the CJ and the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to post resident land judges in Naivasha and Kericho to reduce the cost and distance covered in getting access to justice and ease pressure on the Nakuru Environment and Land court. Currently, Justice Sila Munyao handles land matters from Nakuru, Narok, Naivasha, Nyandarua and Kericho. Last year, the JSC recommended the appointment of 28 judges. Nine of the judges are to be appointed to the position of judge of the High Court while 19 are expected to join the Environment and Land Court.

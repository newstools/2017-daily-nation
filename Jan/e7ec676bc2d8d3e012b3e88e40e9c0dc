The rapper Soulja Boy, whose 2007 track "Crank That" became a major dance craze, was charged Monday with felony weapons charges that could land him four years in prison. Los Angeles prosecutors announced two felony counts and a misdemeanor charge against the 26-year-old, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way. The rapper, who was arrested at his Los Angeles home on December 15, is accused of owning an illegal assault weapon and possessing another gun despite restrictions due to a previous conviction. The Glock handgun was allegedly stolen from a police vehicle, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office said, adding that Soulja Boy faced up to four years in state prison. "Crank That (Soulja Boy)," the rapper's debut released when he was still a teenager, was the first single ever to be downloaded three million times, although the record has since been surpassed. The song became a viral sensation online as dancers tried out the moves, which entail shaking arms alternately to the right and the left. Soulja Boy struggled to replicate his success in the ensuing years and more recently has turned to reality television and promoting online poker.

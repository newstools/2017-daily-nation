Starring Paul Rust, Gillian Jacobs It’s just like the title. You know what’s coming. You know who might or might not get together. But you will still watch it to see how it plays out – and the turning out might surprise you. Paul Rust (who reminds me very much of Paul Rudd, in that dorky way from Clueless) plays Gus, who has just gotten out of a relationship; Jacobs plays Mickey, who is constantly trying to get out of a few. Their paths cross and keep leading them to each other, despite the fact that they both have issues they need to overcome. When it begins, it is a bit too unrelatable, and then halfway through they realize they need diversity in the show and it becomes somewhat better. An entertaining show to binge-watch before you go back to work, perhaps.

A Standard Media Group journalist was on Tuesday charged with stealing a co-worker's vehicle. Aaron Obudho Ochieng is accused of stealing a Mercedes Benz E200 belonging to KTN reporter and news anchor Joy Doreen Biira. The vehicle is valued at Sh2.8 million and was stolen from the company's parking lot on Mombasa Road on December 23 last year. He faced an alternative charge of handling stolen property. Mr Ochieng denied the charges and was released on a Sh1 million bond or Sh300,000 cash bail. The stolen car was recovered at a car wash in Kisumu on Friday with different number plates. Three suspects were arrested and booked at the Industrial Area Police Station. According to a police report, Ms Biira parked her car at the yard but later realised the keys were missing from her desk. She then went to the parking lot to check whether her vehicle was there, only to find it missing. Police said she immediately reported the matter to the company's security and transport officer. She and the officer then questioned the guards at the gate and established that someone had left the premises with the motor vehicle. They reported the incident to the Industrial Area Police Station, triggering an investigation that led to Mr Ochieng.   Its registration number had been changed from KBY 831K to KCH 117L.

It is now “summer” time in Kenya.  One of the main functions of the skin is temperature regulation which it does by releasing sweat when the skin is hot. Perspiration helps to control the body’s temperature. Here are some ways to keep yourself cool and fresh: 1. Shower twice a day. A cold shower will give you an extra edge of freshness.  After drying yourself, use anti-perspirant roll on to control sweating. If you hardly perspire, a mild deodorant will suffice. Apply water-based moisturiser on your face and body. If you spent the day all hot and bothered, use menthol based shower gel in the evening to give you instant relief. 2. Wear natural fabrics: Natural fabrics such as lightweight cotton, silk, wool and cashmere do not trap heat. Silk is especially great for this weather because it cools the body. Cotton is ideal when it comes to sweat absorption.  Man-made fabrics such as polyester, crimplene and nylon do not allow proper circulation and trap body heat, causing odors and discomfort. 3. Select colours carefully: The most advisable ones include light colours such as white, pastel or baby shades. Light colours reflect heat away from your body. When worn in natural fabrics, these shades provide coolness. On the other hand, dark colours absorb heat making you sweat more. 4. Wear open shoes: As much as possible, wear open shoes, without stockings to maintain maximum freshness and comfort.

An aspirant for the Mbeere North parliamentary seat in Embu County has donated 15 wheelchairs to physically impaired residents. The donation by Dr Patrisio Mjiru, the Embu County Agriculture executive, targeted poor people living in Siakago. Mr Joel Kanyua said the device will make life easier for his wife who was injured in an accident. "It was challenging helping her walk outside the compound but now with the wheelchair, moving her around will be easier. She has had walking problems for about five years now," he said. Also, Ms Felisia Wanjue was relieved when her daughter, Judith Maitha, got the mobility device. She thanked Dr Mjiru and said her burden has been reduced. "It has been difficult for me to look for money to support my family since most of the time I am with my daughter to make sure she is alright. At least now, the wheelchair will help since I will able to move around with her," she said. Dr Mjiru said the programme will continue. He challenged the government to engage in more of such efforts.

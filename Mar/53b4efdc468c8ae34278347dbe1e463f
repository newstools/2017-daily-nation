Lecturers have demanded a stop to ongoing job evaluation by Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Universities academic staff union (UASU) Secretary General Constantine Wasonga said they are concerned with the exercise since its using a tool that has been discredited by distinguished human resource experts. The exercise is being conducted for SRC by PicewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). “Uasu calls upon SRC to temporarily stop the exercise, to enable review its methodology and involve UASU in the exercise,” said Dr Wasonga. He observed that the tool in its current form ranks managerial duties above academic scholarship. The evaluation is being used by the commission to determine the salaries of public servants.

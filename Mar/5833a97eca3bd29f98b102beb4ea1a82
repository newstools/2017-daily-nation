Singer Bernice Nduku, popularly known to many as Lady Bee switched from secular to gospel music in 2012 after she got saved. But the journey so far, as she narrates on her social media platforms has been everything but easy to the point she thought her life was way better before giving it to Christ. My journey has not been easy. So many times I feel like I m drowning, like I can t move any more and even think I was doing better than I am now. The devil is a liar, the singer wrote after posting a photo of herself from 2009 in a mini dress and cigarette in hand. You know it s very sad and disappointing to do something and you can t see the results at once. But God s ways are not our ways, His time is always best. At times I feel I m alone on this journey yet so many people look up to me. I feel like I can t do this any more but this gives me confidence and the strength to keep moving she wrote. email print email print Kenya has acquired a Sh2 billion office space in New York as part of a plan that will see Mr Ouko has been accused of wasting public funds by accumulating a Sh1 million phone bill.

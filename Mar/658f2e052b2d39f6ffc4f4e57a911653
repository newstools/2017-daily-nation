Students in need of money have a reason to smile after Gichugu MP Njogu Barua disbursed bursaries amounting to Sh24 million. Speaking at General Kassam Stadium in Kianyaga town, Mr Barua said 11,000 secondary and college students have benefitted. The lawmaker told parents and teachers that all the students from poor family backgrounds who had applied for money had been considered. "We vetted the applicants and all [of them] qualified to be awarded bursary," he said, adding that he is committed to ensure that no bright and needy students drop out due to lack of fees. The MP said that since 2013 when the constituency development fund committee started awarding bursary, enrolment had increased. "We have so many students who have joined secondary schools because of the CDF bursary," he observed. Moreover, he said investments in spurring education, such constructing classrooms, dormitories and laboratories, are ongoing. On politics, he foreshadowed that the National Super Alliance (Nasa) will lose to Jubilee Party in the August elections. The legislator also said he is prepared to defend his seat in the polls.

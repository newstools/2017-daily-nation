Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka will compete in the SportPesa Premier League this season following Wednesday’s decision by the Sports Disputes Tribunal to reinstate the two clubs to the top flight. The two teams had suffered relegation to the National Super League at the start of this year after Football Kenya Federation (FKF) ruled they had failed to comply with the newly introduced Caf Club Licensing rules. KCB and Vihiga County, who finished fifth and sixth in the NSL last season, were subsequently promoted. FKF’s decision has now been quashed by the tribunal in a ruling made and read by chairman John Ohaga last evening which stated in part: “We have reached the conclusion that the justice of the case requires we sustain Sofapaka’s continuing participation in the Kenyan Premier League and we accordingly order that Sofapaka be reinstated.” In his reaction, Kenyan Premier League (KPL) chief executive officer Jack Oguda stated: “We are happy with this ruling because much as we believe the club licensing rules are good, the implementation was rushed by the federation. The way forward is for all stakeholders to sit down and plan.” FKF president Nick Mwendwa, who is in Addis Ababa to attend the Confederation of African Football’s annual general assembly and elections, said he will respect the ruling. “It’s the court decision, if that’s the court’s wisdom, then so be it. We shall respect it,” said Mwendwa, in a text message. Sofapaka assistant coach John Baraza was equally elated. “We are elated by this decision and are ready to hit the ground running because we have been preparing well. Justice has been done,” said the former star defender. Consequently, the 2017 SportPesa Premier League will now have 18 teams, following this ruling. The league kicked off last weekend following a two-month delay in the wake of this stand off between FKF and KPL.

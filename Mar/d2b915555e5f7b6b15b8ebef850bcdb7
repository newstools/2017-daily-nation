With the exception of Rwanda’s Ernest Ndayinsenga who withdrew at the last minute for personal reasons, all the players have reported at Muthaiga Golf Club all set to tackle the par-71 course in the 2017 Barclays Kenya Open. Challenge Tour director Paul Carrigil said this year’s tournament being the first in the Challenge Tour series has received a strong field. “It will be interesting to see defending champion Sebastian Soderberg battling it out with some of the past Kenya Open winners Robert Dinwiddie and Gary Boyd who clinched their title right here at Muthaiga," said Carrigil, a former player himself. Ndayinsenga’s place has been taken over by Zambia’s Madalitso Muthiya, one of the regular players in the Sunshine Tour. Zambia had not been represented in the Open while Zimbabwe has two entries in Stephen Ferreira and Mark Williams, while South Africa has entered eight players. They include the 2014 Kenya Open champion Jakes Roos and Danie Van Tonder who has been a regular player in the Open and in Kenya. Kenya’s Anil Shah was still on the reserve list Tuesday, hoping to get a game in case of a last-minute withdrawal by a visiting player. Also on the reserve list was Zimbabwe’s Tongoma Charamba who played in last week’s Jamii Telkom PGK Masters at Sigona Golf Club.   Six other teams tied on 44 points.

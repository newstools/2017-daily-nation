Chief Justice David Maraga has cautioned newly admitted lawyers against engaging in corrupt deals while handling cases saying he will not entertain delinquency in courts. Justice Maraga who spoke on Tuesday at the Supreme Court when he presided over the admission of 260 lawyers to the roll of advocates, said he remains committed to end corruption in the judiciary. “The greatest mistake that young lawyers make is to think that one can wake up one day and become wealthy,” said the Chief Justice. Justice Maraga noted that complaints against lawyers from the public on corruption allegation are on the rise and urged the newly admitted lawyers to champion for a corrupt free working relationship with their clients. Last week, Advocates Complaints Commission (ACC) complained that the number of cases being reported by the public against lawyers are on the rise. The Commission Chairperson Beauttah Siganga argued that they received over 600 complaints against the about 13,000 advocates practicing in the country representing about 10 per cent. “This country expects you to help in the fight against corruption and therefore none of you should engage in corruption,” the CJ told the newly admitted lawyers. This was the highest admission as normally, the number of lawyers admitted at a time range from about 150. This year’s admission was the fourth to be presided over by Justice Maraga, making the number of lawyers he has admitted to the bar to 635, since he assumed office. He asked lawyers to focus more on helping the less privileged people to get justice. “You also have the duty to carry yourself in decorum and while in court, and to be able to defend the judiciary where need be,” he said. He also asked the lawyers not misadvise their clients so as to earn money from them. Further the chief Justice said the judiciary will only interfere with other arms of government when it is lawful and constitutionally required. “The judiciary shall remain nonpartisan,” he said.

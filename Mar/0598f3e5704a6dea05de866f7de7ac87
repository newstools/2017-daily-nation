Salaries of Kisumu County workers will be delayed following the breakdown of IFMIS system A notice was served to the county staff over the delay in the February salaries. According to the notice dated March 7, the delay has been caused by a “breakdown in IFMIS payment processing system.” “We are in constant communication with the National Treasury to resolve the issue,” states the notice in part. The IFMIS is an automated system that enhances efficiency in planning budgeting, procurement, expenditure management and reporting in the national and county governments. County Director of Communication Atieno Otieno confirmed the delay in payments but assured workers that the matter is being handled. “There was a breakdown in IFMIS not only in Kisumu but we are told it is now working and the salaries are being processed,” Ms Otieno said. A county staff who spoke to Nation.co.ke said they were facing difficulties in settling their bills including rent. The employee said they have also not been paid their allowances. “Some of our claims dating back to last year have not been settled. We have just been told that the vote was exhausted,” he said. Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga said most counties are yet to receive their salaries. Ms Odinga said financial woes in the county affected her journey to the ongoing devolution conference in Naivasha, Nakuru County. “Yesterday (Tuesday) I could not even attend my session due to lack of facilitation,” she said.

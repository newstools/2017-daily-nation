Immigration officials in Nakuru have unearthed a syndicate involved in the influx of beggars from Tanzania and other East African countries to the town. The beggars are used by the syndicate to collect money from the public. Acting on a tip-off, police and the immigration officials on Wednesday evening rounded up 11 beggars. The 11 included disabled men and women aged between 25 and 35 years According to an immigration official who led the crackdown, the Tanzanian beggars were picked up from the town’s main street - Kenyatta Avenue. “There must be someone organising the entry of these beggars into the town centre. “It appears that they are being dropped at specific [points] very early in the morning and picked up late in the evening,” said the official. FROM MUSOMA Those arrested are said to be from Musoma in Tanzania. Police have launched investigations with the aim of arresting those behind the human trafficking syndicate, Nakuru police chief Joshua Omukata said. “The beggars have been staying in the country illegally,” said Mr Omukata. Those arrested were taken to court where Senior Resident Magistrate Joe Mkutu Omido ordered their deportation. Residents and members of the civil society have in the past complained about the increasing number of street children and beggars in Nakuru Town. They argued that their presence was an eyesore and compromised the security of visitors coming to the town.

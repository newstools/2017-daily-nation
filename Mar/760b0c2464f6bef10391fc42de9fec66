With 159 days to the August 8 General Election, politicians have engaged top gear in their hunt for votes. Today, Deputy President William Ruto will meet Kamba leaders at his Karen home. Mr Ruto, the Jubilee Party Deputy Party leader, has been meeting different delegations at both his Nairobi and Sugoi in Uasin Gishu County homes. Apart from attempts to consolidate support for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election, the DP is also setting ground for his 2022 stab at the presidency. Meanwhile, the National Super Alliance (Nasa) principals will today meet with the outfit’s 12-man committee that is in the process of looking for the team’s flag bearer. Musalia Mudavadi’s press secretary Kibisu Kabatesi said the meeting will be held to update the principals on how far the discussions have gone. ODM’s Raila Odinga will today take a break before heading to Wajir on Thursday. Mr Odinga had led his colleagues Mr Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka, and Moses Wetang’ula in tours of Meru and Tharaka Nithi counties, considered Jubilee’s strongholds, where the rallies attracted huge crowds. Mr Wetang’ula, on the other hand, will today chair a Ford Kenya managerial meeting at the party’s headquarters in Lavington, Nairobi. The meeting, the party said, will discuss the party’s positions and plans on its nominations and those of Nasa. There has been a big dilemma on whether Nasa should hold joint nominations or its four constituent parties allowed to conduct different primaries, with the risk of ‘political cannibalism” where the alliance competes against itself. At the same time, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chair Wafula Chebukati will this morning open a meeting of the National Council of Churches of Kenya in Limuru. The NCCK is holding the meeting with various elders from different communities in Kenya. Also attending the forum  will be Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet.

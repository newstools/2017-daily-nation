BANGALORE Ravindra Jadeja joined his fellow Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin at the top of the world rankings Wednesday after his seven wickets in India's series-levelling second-Test win over Australia. Ashwin had been out on his own as the number one Test bowler, but Jadeja's peformance has put the pair on the same level of points, the International Cricket Council said. Left-arm spinner Jadeja returned with figures of 6-63 in Australia's first innings to help spark India's comeback during their 75-run win in Bangalore on Tuesday. Off-spinner Ashwin also played a match-winning role by taking six wickets in the Australian second innings as India squared the four-match series. Despite the disappointment of losing the second Test, Australian skipper Steve Smith remains at the top of the batting rankings while his opposite number Virat Kohli has slipped one place to third, behind England's Joe Root.   Australia captain Steve Smith faced calls for disciplinary action Wednesday after a row over alleged cheating.

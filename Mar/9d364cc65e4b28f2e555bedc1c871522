West Pokot Governor Simon Kachapin has urged the government to carry out security operations in Baringo County with fairness and caution, calling for a durable solution to prevent further deaths. Speaking in Eldoret, Mr Kachapin advised that security officers should isolate criminals so as to avoid targeting innocent residents. He also said no community should be victimised. "The national government should approach the insecurity issue in Baringo with a lot of caution since there are a few criminals bringing problems in the region," he said. The region has witnessed escalation of violence, with Kenya Red Cross pulling out over lack of security of its staff. The agency was distributing cash and other non edible items to residents in Baringo North, Baringo South and Tiaty. Last month a resident of Chemorong'ion was shot dead by suspected bandits. Similar incidences have forced residents to flee to safer areas.

He also called for the disarming of all pastoralist communities, arguing it is an effective strategy. On matters development, he chastised Kanu leaders for claiming to support development yet the party leaders marginalised other areas when it was in power. "Kanu was in power for 24 years and they marginalized Tiaty. Why are they now talking to the press about issues and yet they were quiet all along?" he posed to Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo. He said development was brought to Tiaty when former president Mwai Kibaki took power.

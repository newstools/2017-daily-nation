Jubilee aspirants from Nyandarua have successfully elected their county elections board officials during a peaceful exercise held in Ol-Kalou. All the six sitting MPs were present during the elections. Also present was Governor Daniel Waithaka Mwangi, his deputy Waithaka Kirika and several MCAs. Jubilee Party National Elections Board Vice-Chairperson Vesca Kangogo had warned aspirants against engaging in confrontations over nominees to the board. She cautioned that they risked finding themselves on the wrong side of the party’s constitution. “At the end of the day, there will be a functional elections board even if you fight. To avoid finding yourself on the wrong side of the party’s constitution, behave yourselves in the most honourable way possible,” she cautioned. “When you fight today and win like the people of Nakuru did yesterday, it is not that you will be the best fighter, it will be only because you will not have found your fighting match,” she added. On Monday, the Jubilee Party headquarters in Nakuru was turned into a wrestling arena following a clash between two parliamentary aspirants for the Nakuru Town East parliamentary during the election of the county board officials. Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria engaged supporters of his arch-rival, former Nakuru mayor Benson Mwangi, in a physical fight following a heated exchange after the two sides clashed over the choice of a representative to the elections board. The elections were, however, concluded successfully after a full list of nominated candidates was filled.

Before producer and business mogul Don Jazzy founded Mavin Records that boasts of a superstar line up of Nigerian artistes, he was just an average Joe trying to make it in the music business. He recently went down memory when he visited the Big Brother Naija housemates where he recounted how, together with D banj, they founded Mo Hits records back in 2004. But since they did not have money, D banj s parents were the financiers. Until Mo Hits time, when we started the company business, we were like, this thing is attracting a lot of people from across Africa and the world, so we have to try and grow it into an empire. D banj and I sat down and agreed that now that we re going to be putting out songs, we need to have a record label, but then we did not have money. D banj is from a wealthy family, his parents put in some money, they gave us money to shoot our first video. I then decided that since we re partners we re going to share the profit 50/50, he told the housemates. As soon as we made the money we went back to appreciate his mother for the help rendered to us at the beginning, he revealed. The two are now worth millions of dollars. email print email print The defending champion is all too aware of the stiff competition.

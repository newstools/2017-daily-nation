Former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguruâ€™s campaign billboards were vandalised by unknown people in Kirinyaga. Supporters of the Kirinyaga gubernatorial aspirant accused her opponents of hiring goons to vandalise two billboards in Makutano and Kagio. Ms Waiguru's running mate Peter Ndambiri said some rivals of the former CS maybe responsible for the Thursday night damage. "Those who destroyed our billboards are sensing defeat," said Mr Ndambiri adding that no amount of intimidation would deter Ms Waiguru from pursing her ambition. "She is stronger politically than before. Those who vandalised the billboards will not discourage her at all," said Mr Ndambiri. Mr Ndambiri called on police to investigate the incident and bring culprits to book. "It is a criminal offence to destroy property and those involved should be apprehended and charged in court," said Mr Ndambiri. Mr Ndambiri exuded confidence that Ms Waiguru would clinch the Jubilee ticket and win the August polls. "She has what it takes to win," said Mr Ndambiri adding that the bill boards will be replaced.

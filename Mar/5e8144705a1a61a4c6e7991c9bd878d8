ODM governors from the Coast will visit all the region's counties to campaign for party leader Raila Odinga to be President. Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Amason Kingi (Kilifi) and John Mruttu (Taita Taveta) are to hold a series of rallies in Taita Taveta County on Thursday. President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto were in Taita Taveta last Saturday where they launched a number of projects and vouched for Jubilee. The two had earlier visited Lamu and Kilifi counties. On Sunday and Monday, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto campaigned in Mombasa, Kwale and Kilifi. Jubilee reaped big during the tour as a number of opposition leaders defected to the party. They included led senators Dan Mwazo and Ali Bule, woman representatives Halima Ware, Joyce Lay, MP Peter Shehe and Tana River Governor Hussein Dado. Mr Mwazo is eyeing the Taita Taveta governorâ€™s seat while Ms Lay wants to be the senator. In Taita Taveta, the ODM leaders will address supporters in Taveta and Wundanyi before holding a rally at Voi stage. The leaders are to also visit Kilifi, Lamu, Tana River and Kwale counties before holding a major rally at Tononoka grounds in Mombasa on March 26.

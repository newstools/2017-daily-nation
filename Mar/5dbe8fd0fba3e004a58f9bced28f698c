Private equity firm Fusion Capital’s new Sh 1.2 billion property has received its first tenant after the Polish government signed a lease agreement for its Trade Office. Fusion Capital’s Real Estate executive director Daniel Kamau said the deal with the Polish Investment and Trade Agency for the Grade A office block will act as a launching-pad for the Polish businesses into Kenya and the rest of East Africa. Mr Kamau said the building had reserved space on 12 floors for offices with 6 floors reserved for motor vehicle parking. “We are excited to host the polish agency and more importantly, the trade function which will promote inter-country commercial interactions thereby improving the two national economies,” he said.

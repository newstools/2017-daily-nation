Security agencies in Butula, Busia County, have profiled areas prone to violence, hoping to mitigate it ahead of the General Election in August. They are Bumala, Murumba Butula, Tingolo, Mauko and Lugulu. Speaking to the Nation, deputy county commissioner Bosek Lagat said they have held security meetings with local leaders and other stakeholders to ensure that peace prevails before and after the elections. "We recently had a meeting with representatives from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and aspirants from Butula sub-county. "We are aware Butula is a volatile area and violence can erupt any time, especially when politicians evoke emotion among the youth," Mr Langat explained. He added that charismatic youth leaders will be culled to help in preaching harmony. Butula MP Michael Onyura entreated his fellow leaders to desist from divisive politics because it has the potency of stirring up violence. Mr Onyura singled out social media as the current avenue of propagating incendiary statements, and called on the National Intelligence Service to track down perpetrators. "I warn the perpetrators of violence. We can't sit down and see our young men and women perish because of a few individuals with personal interests," he said. Various leaders have come out agitating for peaceful elections. And the most important way of guaranteeing the wish is through free, fair and credible elections. In February this year, religious leaders cautioned Kenyans to be wary of people who advocate for chaos, particularly through hate speech. Relevant agencies such as the IEBC have equally urged leaders not to incite the public. READ: Catholic Church wants peaceful elections READ: IEBC boss Chebukati warns politicians over incitement

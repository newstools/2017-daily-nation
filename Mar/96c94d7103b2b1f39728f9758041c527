The warning by the electoral commission that politicians engaging in hate speech risk being locked out of the coming elections is a good thing. However, it has hardly attracted sufficient attention from the public. And one can understand why. There are notorious purveyors of hate speech in the political class, who do not care about such warnings. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) is putting the politicians on notice that its monitors will be out there during the party nominations and that aspiring candidates inciting hatred will be targeted. But as the National Cohesion and Integration Commission has found out, the mere presence of monitors will not deter offenders. However, it is disappointing that past attempts to nail the culprits have been undermined by shoddy investigations and prosecution. But it is also true that in some cases what was deemed as hate speech was merely an argument or people hurling insults at others. Hate speech goes further and failure to punish it will only encourage more. It is this impunity that calls for firm action to serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders. Should the IEBC punish any offenders, this would serve as a good example to politicians and their supporters to avoid conduct that can spark mayhem. But the politicians must also learn to act with decorum.

A lifestyle audit of school principals has been proposed following arson in public schools last year. But the principals have questioned the motive of a lifestyle audit. A draft report has been presented to school heads and will be made public in three or four days. The investigations found that some of the principals were diverting school money for their own use at the expense of students welfare. However, the principals argued that they declare their wealth annually. It is not clear if the recommendations are in the final report to be released soon. More than 100 schools were set on fire. On Wednesday Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said the report had been interrogated by the principals whose schools burned. “We met each stakeholder and explained to them the findings. In three or four days, we will release the report,” said Dr Matiang’i. The draft report says students lacked enough time to relax as students learn from 5am to 9pm with short breaks. TIME TO RELAX “Children should be given enough time to relax instead of focusing on studies throughout,” states the draft report. Over-crowding especially in boarding schools was uncomfortable for students. Poor relations between principals and their deputies have been pointed out. Speaking at Catholic University of Eastern Africa during a conference for the Catholic educational institutions head teachers, Dr Matiang’i lamented that students in schools were being overworked. The investigations were headed by career provincial administrator Claire Omolo. The other team members were Ms Lilian Muli and Mr Patrick Mugo, who are both in the police, educationists Charles Khayira, James Kairu, Dr Gracie Mullei, Loise Nyaseda and Lt Col (Rtd) FC Mugambi.

The mother of Pastor Pius Muiru, who went missing last weekend, was killed and secretly buried in Kigumo. Police on Thursday found the body of Grace Wangari Mwangi buried in a shallow grave in her farm at Karika Village, Murang'a County. The officers made the shocking discovery after being led to the scene by two suspects who were arrested after the woman went missing. Central regional police boss Larry Kieng' told the Nation that Mrs Mwangi may have been kidnapped and subsequently killed. The two suspects were Mrs Mwangi's close acquaintances. COW LIE One is her daughter-in-law and the other is her guard. And contrary to social media reports that it is a cow that was buried in the shallow grave, the body of the deceased has been found in the grave. Police believe the suspects buried her at the same spot that a cow had been buried earlier so as to cover their tracks. Mrs Mwangi, neighbours told the Nation, lived alone with her two sons and little is know about her life. Pastor Muiru is the founder of Maximum Miracle Centre, an evangelical church that has branches in several parts of Kenya. FAME He shot to the political limelight in 2007 when he ran for president on the Kenya People’s Party. He garnered 9,667 votes, which was 0.10 per cent of the total votes cast, to emerge fifth place. The election was controversially won by former President Mwai Kibaki. During the run-up to the campaign, the preacher raised eyebrows when it was reported that he had built a Sh100 million war-chest to run his campaign. PREACHING Commonly referred to as "neno linasema" (the word says) because of his frequent use of the slogan in his preaching, his evangelical church also led to a rise in funky gospel music. Back in the days way before  the influx of the likes of Willy Paul and Bahati into the gospel industry, there was Maximum Melodies headed by Pastor Muiru’s son Andrew. They were the crooners of the famous hit ‘Yesu Ni Mwamba.’

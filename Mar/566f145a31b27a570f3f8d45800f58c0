An official of Kilifi County government has stepped aside to allow a corruption case filed against him to be concluded. In letter dated today, Mr Matano Riziki, director of Supply Chain Management, said he had voluntarily stepped aside to allow for investigations and logical conclusion of the court case filed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on March 13, 2015. The letter was directed to Chief Officer in charge of finance and economic planning Ben Kai and copied to the county secretary and the Head of Public Service in the county administration. Mr Matano said that on Friday anti-corruption detectives raided his office in Kilifi town, arrested him and took him to their offices in Malindi. "I would wish to say that I have stepped aside with immediate effect until the matter pending at the Malindi law court is brought to a logical conclusion," part of the letter read. Mr Matano said his tribulations began on March 13, 2015 when he was arrested by the agency's officers in his office for allegedly soliciting a Sh200, 000 bribe to influence the issuance of a tender to a businessman in the county.

Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho has dismissed claims that his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam certificate is fake. The ODM deputy party leader has said the claims are part of a continuous war by the Jubilee administration targeting him but dismissed it as futile. Through his director of communications, Richard Chacha, Mr Joho said there is no other person or entity in the country questioning his papers except Jubilee. “It is a war that began in 2013. They started (it) through their bloggers and then the newspapers. But I tell you this is a futile attempt by the Jubilee government to discredit the governor,” said Mr Chacha. He urged the media to verify facts from Serani Secondary School, where Governor Joho sat his KCSE exam in 1993. Mr Joho is accused of forging documents to apply for a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Nairobi in 2009. FORGED Mombasa Jubilee politician Ananiah Mwaboza claimed at a press conference on Sunday that Mr Joho had forged the documents and should be punished. Mr Mwaboza produced copies of two certificates indicating that the governor sat his KCSE exam at Serani Secondary School in 1992 and 1993. In the 1992 certificate, which Mr Mwaboza claimed is the genuine one, Mr Joho is shown to have attained a mean grade of D-minus, which cannot qualify him to join any university in Kenya. The second certificate indicates that Mr Joho sat his KCSE exam at the same school in 1993 and obtained a mean grade C-plus, which he used to successfully apply for admission to the University of Nairobi. Said Mr Chacha: “The 1992 document is fake. Go and see the 1993 school file, which is the genuine one. It has all the names of the candidates that year, including Governor Joho’s. That is the document we know.”   Governors are required by law to be university graduates.

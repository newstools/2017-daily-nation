Leaders and residents in Marigat town took to the streets to protest against alleged interference with security operations in Baringo County by West Pokot Senator John Lonyangapuo. The residents, chanting 'arrest Lonyangapuo and Kamket', demanded the resignation of Tiaty MP and Parliament's National Security Committee chairman Asman Kamama. Nominated MCA Charles Kamuren said that residents in Baringo have suffered in the hands of bandits, thus no one should block operations to flush them out. "Lonyangapuo was elected by the people of West Pokot and he has no mandate to be involved with issues that affect Baringo residents. "Why is he defending those bandits who have caused several deaths and have also impoverished our people for ages," Mr Kamuren said.

Mr Kamama denied being involved in the killings and said he will not resign as chairman. "Where was he when our people were killed and tortured? When they killed a three day old baby he never talked," Ilchamus MCA Wesley Lekakimon said.

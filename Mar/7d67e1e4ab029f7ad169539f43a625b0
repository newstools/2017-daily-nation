Ulinzi Stars were on Friday left with a mountain to climb after losing 4-0 to Egyptian side Smouha in the first leg of their Caf Confederation Cup first round match at the at the Borg el Arab Stadium in Alexandria. The soldiers will now have to score four unanswered goals or more in the return leg in a fortnight in Nairobi in order to go through to the group stages. Smouha went ahead in the 19th minute through Ahmad Rauf, before the hosts extended their lead seven minutes later through Islam Mohareb. With the Egyptians raiding the Kenyan giants' goal-mouth with attack after attack, the pressure paid off with Mahmoud Abdelaziz adding a third for the hosts with a thumping header. The goal was initially ruled out for a foul on Ulinzi keeper James Saruni but the referee rescinded his decision and awarded the goal to the delight of the handful fans in the stadium. Mohareb put the icing on the cake in the 86th minute with a superb volley to all but kill the tie. The result now leaves the soldiers with a mountain to climb in the second leg scheduled for March 17 where they will have to win by more than four goals in order to remain in the continental competition.

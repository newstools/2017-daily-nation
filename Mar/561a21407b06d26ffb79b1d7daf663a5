The land question has always been emotive and that is why it must be handled with utmost care. There are several conflicts around the country that are being linked to land tenure. The impending expiry of 99-year land leases is one of the factors fuelling the deadly clashes between ranchers and herders in Laikipia. It has also been mentioned in connection with the anxiety on the tea plantations. It’s in response to this potentially explosive matter that Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi is warning against the politicisation of disputes. He sees possible incitement to gain political support in this year’s elections as a factor in the recent conflicts that have claimed lives and caused destruction of property. While drought is often a good reason for herders to seek pastures in the private ranches, this time around, some invasions have political motivation. It is not enough, therefore, to ask politicians to desist from fanning the conflict. This infringement on the property of others is unacceptable and the authorities must act firmly and decisively to restore order. But a task force inaugurated on Tuesday to review the extension and renewal of land leases could not have come at a better time. The team must move quickly to fairly adjudicate, defuse the tension and restore normality.

The Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) will on Saturday announce the presidential candidate it will back in the August 8 general election. Speaking in Magombe, Budalangi Constituency on Tuesday, party leader Ababu Namwamba said they have already deliberated on the elections and who they will support following a two-day retreat at Sentrim Lake Elementaita Lodge early March. “We have now chartered our way forward. We can sit down and have a discussion with anybody without sanctions. This Saturday we will announce the presidential candidate Labour Party will support in [the] August polls. SUPPORT CHOICE “I urge you that since we now own a house, whoever we will announce, give him ultimate support,” he said. Mr Namwamba, whose party has remained coy on which coalition to join between the ruling Jubilee and the opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa), added that the party has already done ground work on the best candidate with realistic chances to clinch the presidency. “We already know who will emerge victorious in the August 8 polls. We also know who we can sit down with us on a round table and will respond to our request to bring development to the people of Budalangi,” he added. The Budalangi MP also added that they have already summed up discussions on election strategies, campaign programme, nomination and support for party candidates at all levels. Mr Namwamba resigned as the ODM secretary-general in July 2016 on claims that top party leaders had betrayed him.   Labour Party officials to meet in Nakuru County to deliberate on August elections.

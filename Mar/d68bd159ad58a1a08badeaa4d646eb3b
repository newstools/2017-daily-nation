Drug barons are fighting back following a vicious crackdown to stop them, Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa has said. Mr Marwa hinted that senior officers in the region have been threatened. Addressing journalists at the National Youth Service yard in Mombasa, Mr Marwa said the dealers were unhappy with the struggle to save lives. “Even if they fight back how will they fight a legitimate government? I have never understood how a mere drug baron would fight a legitimate government. It is not possible to issue threats against a good course,” Mr Marwa said. The administrator, who was accompanied by county commissioner Evans Achoki, said the government will not relent on the fight no matter the intimidations. He said the war is not personal, but based on intelligence. “I am prepared to put my life at risk for the sake of this country. That is the extent to which I am committed to this fight. Anybody who is trying to intimidate Pius Macharia (Coast CID boss) and Philip Tuimur (Coast police boss) is wasting his time. “Even if all of us will be dead and buried, the war will be won whether you like it or not," Mr Marwa added. Mr Marwa dismissed reports that he has been moved to the volatile Rift Valley. “Transfers are not done by bloggers on social media. You are not transferred by ODM bloggers. I am not aware of that and that blogger should be arrested wherever he is, but tell them even if they take me to Kalahari Desert, I will drill water or even oil,” he said. This came after reports emerged that the fiery coordinator had been moved. On Wednesday, ODM communications official Philip Etale tweeted that Mr Marwa had been transferred. However, his statement was dismissed by Director of Digital Communication in the Office of the President, Dennis Itumbi.

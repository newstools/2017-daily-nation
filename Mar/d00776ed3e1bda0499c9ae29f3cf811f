ODM has told President Uhuru Kenyatta to remain alive to the fact that Kisii and Nyamira counties are ODM and Nasa zones, as he plans for his two-day tour of the regions. ODM national Treasure and Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire, a fierce critic of the Jubilee government, told President Kenyatta to only discuss matters relating to development, but not politics for the "people had already made up their minds". "I am in Canada on official PAC business. I learnt that the President will be in the area. No problem. He is free to visit any part of the country. The President must be more serious on matters honesty and development in the area and also appreciate that this is an ODM/NASA area," he said in a statement from Canada. He continued: "I am told he is coming to name one of the Nyambaria dormitories and launch it as a development project. Also to claim Kemera-Amabuko road as a Jubilee development. You all know the story of this road and reluctance of government funding." Mr Bosire also cautioned the Jubilee administration against seeking credit for Nyangori water project - which he said was initiated by East African Community and funded by ADB.

The President and his deputy William Ruto are expected to lead a high-powered team to Kisii and Nyamira on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively to launch various projects and to campaign for his re-election, hoping to wrest the region from the Opposition's grasp. But Mr Bosire said nothing would change the peoples' minds to support Jubilee. The Head of State is keen on winning opposition strongholds: Coast, Gusii and Western.

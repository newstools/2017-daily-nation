Kenya’s economy remains robust despite the various challenges, President Uhuru Kenyatta reiterated on Wednesday. In his last State of the Nation address in Parliament, Mr Kenyatta defended the country’s economic growth, backing his belief with indicators, including a 5.9 per cent average gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2013. “Our foreign exchange reserves have increased from 4.3 months of import cover in 2013 to 5.1 months of cover at the start of 2017. Our revenues from tax collections have increased from Sh847 billion in 2013 to Sh1.2 trillion at the end of 2016,” he said. Mr Kenyatta said a stable economic environment over the last four years has created 2.3 million new jobs. But the president admitted to the reality on the ground, with the common man faced with economic hardships. GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH He said many Kenyans who cannot relate to the good economic growth figures need their concerns addressed. “Too many Kenyans cannot relate to how GDP impacts on the price of unga, or what the stability of our currency means for them at the end of every month,” the President said. A raft of business reforms to boost smooth operations was, however, shadowed by a bleak performance of many businesses, with 2.2 million micro, small and medium enterprises closing in the past five years. The closures were in wholesale and retail as well as repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles, which accounted for 73 per cent of the closures. Most of the businesses that collapsed just before starting their fourth year in operation cited shortage of operating funds.   Uhuru cites milestones in his first term as Head of State.

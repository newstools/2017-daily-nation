Two people died and 12 others were injured in a car crash in Kirinyaga County. The incident, which occurred on the Makutano-Embu road at Difathas market, involved a 14-seater matatu and a Toyota Probox. The survivors were taken to Embu and Kerugoya hospitals for treatment. County police commander Joseph Nthenge said the man and the woman died on the spot. "Two people among them a woman succumbed to injuries instantly but the rest who escaped death were rescued by the police," Mr Nthenge said. The matatu was heading to Embu from Nairobi and all the seats were occupied. Witnesses said the public service vehicle veered off the road, rolling several times before landing in a ditch. Residents and police officers had to use axes to cut through the vehicle's body to free the trapped passengers. "They hacked away metals to rescue the trapped victims. Some had suffered multiple fractures," Ms Mary Muthoni, a witness, said. The wreckages were towed to Wang'uru police station. Mr Nthenge said investigations have been launched and cautioned drivers against speeding. "To avoid such fatal accidents, drivers plying local routes should adhere to traffic rules," he advised. He warned that drivers found flouting traffic rules will be arrested and prosecuted.

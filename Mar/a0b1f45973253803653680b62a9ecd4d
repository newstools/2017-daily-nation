Nairobi County Government now wants the National Government to waive duty on computers and computer accessories. In a statement on Wednesday, City Hall argued that doing so would enable the County's development partners to procure computers cheaply for County schools. The county executive for Education and ICT Ann Lokidor who spoke in Marura Primary School in Kariobangi North during the opening of 16 completed classrooms and a multipurpose hall, said that they had sourced for international partners to supply computers and removal of duty would boost the programme. "Provision of Education is enshrined our Constitution and therefore our vision is to offer globally competitive, quality basic education and training for sustainable development. Our mission is to provide, promote and manage basic education and training for the general welfare of Nairobi residents," said Ms Lokidor. The county also announced that it had sourced for a partner who was ready to equip County schools; each with 20 computers. "The removal of duty on computers would thus be a boost to the programme as it will increase the number of available computers in our schools," said Ms Lokidor. The county says that it has effectively led in computerisation of schools which has overtaken the National governmentâ€™s quest to equip schools with computers. The school project is sponsored by the WestGate Mall at a cost of Sh70 million. In 2016 Governor Evans Kidero broke ground for the construction of 32 classrooms by WestGate's Alex Tractenberng who committed to facilitate the construction of the school. Dr Kidero's administration has so far been involved in the construction of over 172 classrooms in over 20 schools in Nairobi County amongst them; Olympic Primary and Mathari Primary among others.

Kenyan scholar Godwin Murunga has been appointed executive secretary of one of Africa’s premier research organisation. Dr Murunga landed the post at the continent’s think tank, the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA). In a statement issued from Dakar, Senegal on Monday, CODESRIA President Dzodzi Tsikata said the Kenyan historian and political analyst will become the seventh executive secretary of the organisation. Dr Murunga, who is also a Daily Nation columnist, takes over from Dr Ebrima Sall from the Gambia. The Kenyan scholar currently teaches at the Institute of Development Studies of the University of Nairobi. He is the past director of the Africa Leadership Centre in Nairobi, and was a member of the Executive Committee of CODESRIA for two consecutive terms (2005-2011). “Dr Murunga brings to CODESRIA many years of robust scholarship as evidenced by the incisive analysis that characterised his numerous scholarly publications,” Prof Tsikata said. She added that Dr Murunga brings “valuable teaching and management experience and a deep knowledge of the higher education landscape in Africa.” She said the scholar uniquely qualified for the position given his in-depth knowledge of CODESRIA, a track record of robust scholarship and exemplary leadership, and his strong and clear vision for organisation’s future.

Kenya once again dominated the Lake Biwa Marathon in Japan as Ezekiel Chebii led compatriot Vincent Kipruto to a 1-2 finish in the men’s race. Chebii, who trains in Kaptagat in Elgeyo Marakwet County, clocked a winning and personal best time of two hours, nine minutes and six seconds, ahead of Vincent Kipruto who ran 2:09:15 while Uganda’s Solomon Mutai was third in 2:09:59. “I trained hard the whole of December and January since I knew this was a tough race. I wanted to run my personal best which I did and I’m happy for that,” said Chebii on phone from Japan. He proved the stronger man, outsprinting Kipruto over the last few 200 metres for victory. “When we were running, I thought my friend Kipruto had enough kick pose a serious threat to me, but I was surprised he didn’t, which made me go for the title since I was still strong,” said Chebii. The Kenyan duo broke away from the pack at the 32km and it was clear by then that the winner would be one of the two. An elated, and clearly confident Chebii said he was looking forward to running a Majors marathon in the near future either Berlin or Chicago. “I want to come back home and continue with my training because I’m targeting one of the big city races.” He hoped that his exploits in Japan would arouse the interest of Kenyan selectors for the World Athletics Championships that will be held in London later this year. “If Athletics Kenya will include me in the Kenyan team to the World Championships in August, I will be very happy and ready to bring glory home. “There are so many athletes and if I get a chance I will do my best. I know I am good enough,” he said. But making the Kenyan team will be a tall order considering his best time and the calibre of runners that AK can choose from. Kipruto was running in Lake Biwa for the third time. He won the Lake Biwa Marathon on his debut appearance in 2013 and finished third a year later.

HOUSTON Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward led the offensive charge as the Utah Jazz claimed the season series against the Houston Rockets with a 115-108 victory on Wednesday. The Jazz improved to 41-24 on the season and moved to within three games of the third seed in the Western Conference standings. "Any time you're on the road and you hit shots early, it's a good feeling because it's hard to come back when you get down early on the road," Hayward said. "To stay with the home team that's a good feeling. Tonight was an example of that." Gobert tallied a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds in front of a crowd of 16,200 at the Toyota Center arena. Hayward delivered several clutch jumpers en route to 23 points, seven rebounds and four assists for Utah, which stretched its winning streak to four games. The Rockets were held back by a lack of shooting as they made just eight of 32 attempts from three-point range. Utah hit 12 of 31 from beyond the arc. After cutting a 13-point deficit to three points in the third quarter, the Rockets finished the period shooting one of nine on three-pointers and five of 13 from the free-throw line. While Houston clawed to within four down the stretch, its defence failed repeatedly in trying to stop the Jazz. Guard James Harden led the Rockets with 35 points and six assists, while centre Clint Capela added a double-double (19 points, 12 boards). Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell came off the bench to score 12 each. Both Gobert (10) and Rodney Hood (12) reached double figures by the intermission as Utah stretched its 30-22 lead entering the second quarter to 11 points by the break.   San Antonio Spurs beat Sacramento Kings 114-104.

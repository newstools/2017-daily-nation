Rome,FridayEuropean Union (EU) leaders gather in Rome today to proclaim their common future on the bloc s 60th birthday, despite Britain s looming exit from the bloc.The 27 leaders will use the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome on March 25, 1957, to praise the peace and prosperity, they say, came to Europe in the aftermath of World War II.But the ghost at the banquet will be British Prime Minister Theresa May, who instead of joining the party in the splendour of a 16th-century palazzo will be in London preparing to trigger the Brexit divorce just four days later.From migration and terrorism to populism and the eurozone debt crisis, Brexit is a cloud on the birthday celebrations of a union formed to rebuild Europe from the ashes of war.Perhaps seeking divine inspiration to help with their troubles, the EU leaders were to have a special audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Friday afternoon.Today, they will gather for a ceremonial meeting in the Hall of the Horatii and Curiatii, in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline Square, the same place where the Treaty of Rome was originally signed.They will issue a declaration that Europe is our common future in a rapidly changing world and set out a roadmap for the next 10 years, before posing for a family photo .UNDERLYING TENSIONSBut in a sign of the underlying tensions in today s union, there are still last-minute rows over how far the declaration will go in suggesting that EU states can have different paces and intensity of cooperation.EU President Donald Tusk said, in his summit invitation letter, that Rome would be an opportunity to celebrate our history together and take stock of 60 years of integration. He warned of the challenges ahead in a changing geopolitical situation, including an uncertain ally in US President Donald Trump, an aggressive Russia and increasing protectionism.Crucial elections this year in France where far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been showing strongly in polls and Germany are adding to the general sense that Europe is at a turning point. It is no secret that the historical moment we are facing requires deeper and more solid reflection on the challenges for the union, Tusk, a former Polish premier, said.Cracks have appeared, in the EU, in recent years, with its rapid expansion into the former Soviet-dominated east and problems of managing the single currency.The rise of nationalist and populist parties poses a particular threat to the EU s dream of itself, particularly in Poland. email print email print The defending champion is all too aware of the stiff competition.

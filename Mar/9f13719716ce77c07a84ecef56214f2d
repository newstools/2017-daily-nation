A suspect accused of raping and killing a primary school head teacher was attacked by a mob in Kiamutugu village. Angry villagers, who had been searching for him following the Sunday killing, caught him and started beating him up before assistant chief Patrick Mureithi and two Administration Police saved him from being burnt. They had stormed into a farm where they found the man hiding in a hole. He was taken to Kianyaga police station. County Police Commander Joseph Nthenge said the suspect is likely to be prosecuted for murder. "If the suspect survives, he will face murder charges. He has been transferred to Embu Level Five Hospital," he said. The villagers followed the police to the station where they demanded he be released to face their wrath, which police declined, forcing them to shoot in the air to disperse the irate residents. Ms Jane Wanjiru was the head teacher of Githure Primary School. She was attacked while taking a bath in her home in Karinga village, Gichugu constituency, then sexually assaulted and killed. The assailant then proceeded to the neighbouring home where he also raped a 70-year old woman. Ms Wanjiru's relative is the one who found her.   Arur says suspected attacker is a well-known criminal.

Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho resumed work today after Monday’s office arrest to block him from attending President Kenyatta’s event. Mr Joho went to his office in morning from his Nyali home using his official vehicle and the bridge on which he was blocked during the Monday lockdown on Mombasa Island. 12PM The governor was set free after President Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto left following the re-launch of the Mtongwe Ferry Services and road projects in Kilifi and Kwale. County Director of Communication Richard Chacha said the security personnel who had surrounded Mr Joho’s left shortly after 12pm when President Kenyatta had completed re-launching the ferry services. “Everything is going on smoothly,” Mr Chacha told the Nation. BLOCKED Mr Joho was blocked from attending the relaunch of the ferry services after it emerged that he planned to take on Mr Kenyatta over the President's claim that the county boss had failed to develop Mombasa even after receiving Sh40 billion in devolution funds. Mr Joho on Tuesday denied the claim, saying Mombasa had only receive Sh17 billion and asked the national government to release the Sh23 billion it is keeping. On Monday, Mr Joho accused President Kenyatta of focusing on gaining political benefits in the re-launching of the ferry services. BRIDGE He said the French government had set aside funds for a bridge at the Likoni channel but the Jubilee government was yet to implement it. “We know that the French ambassador’s office had disbursed funds for a feasibility study and design for the Likoni channel bridge but they said it was a national government function and we left it with them," he said. “But what we are seeing is that they are not interested in helping the residents permanently by putting the bridge and theirs is to just come and take political mileage."     Police block, escort and detain Mombasa governor as President Kenyatta re-launches Mtongwe ferry.

A senior Kenya Wildlife Service officer was shot dead and a ranger injured by suspected poachers at Galana Kulalu near the Tsavo East National Park. Four poachers were also killed during the Friday evening shootout. The injured ranger is being treated at St Joseph Shelter of Hope Hospital in Voi, Taita Taveta. According to Voi police boss Joseph Chesire a manhunt is underway for two suspected poachers who escaped. One of them escaped with serious gunshot wounds. Sources from KWS said the suspects escaped with guns recovered from the slain officer. However, two AK47 rifles, 35 bullets and two pieces of ivory were recovered. Two weeks ago another poacher was killed at the Tsavo East National park. Poaching incidents in the Tsavo escalated in the recent past with some citing the invasion of livestock into the park as the main reason for the spike. More than 80, 000 livestock from the North Eastern part of the country have invaded the Tsavo in search of water and pasture.

Business in Mandera County Assembly was disrupted Wednesday afternoon after MCAs engaged in a fistfight. The MCAs differed over the supplementary budget. The mace is also missing from the assembly chambers. Trouble started in the chambers following an attempt to re-introduce the finance Bill containing a supplementary budget of Sh1.7billion which had been rejected by MCAs last week. The MCAs last Thursday claimed the county executive was introducing new projects instead of settling pending bills. Governor Ali Roba claimed that the supplementary budget was to address ravaging drought and settling pending bills. On Wednesday, a section of MCAs allied to the governor attempted to introduce the same motion but were opposed by other MCAs. Rhamu Ward MCA Issack Dahir grabbed the mace and ran with it outside the assembly hall. It is not clear where he took the mace. MCAs who were involved in the scuffle are at Mandera Police Station recording statements over the scuffle.   Residents accuse MCAs rejecting budget meant to help fight drought.

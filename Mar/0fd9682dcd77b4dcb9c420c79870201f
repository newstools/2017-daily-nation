Taita Taveta Senator Dan Mwazo has defected from ODM to Jubilee Party, whose ticket he will use to contest for the gubernatorial seat.Senator Mwazo announced the move in Mwatate where he hailed the Jubilee administration's achievement."I will be moving to Jubilee," Mr Mwazo said when he was welcomed to address the crowd by Deputy President William Ruto.Mr Mwazo becomes the latest Coast ODM leader to defect to the President Uhuru Kenyatta-led party after Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, MPs Gideon Mung'aro (Kilifi North), Mustafa Idd (Kilifi South) and Kwale Woman rep Zainab Chidzuga.Taita Taveta Woman rep Joyce Lay is also expected to jump ship to JP, through which she will vie for the senatorial seat.Mr Mwazo said Coast residents will vote for leaders based on their development record.President Uhuru Kenyatta welcomed Mr Mwazo saying he had made a "wise decision to run away from tribalism, hatred and lack of development".Mr Kenyatta and his deputy's tour of the Coast region will be graced by the launching of various development works and is scheduled to end on Monday.President Kenyatta hit out at Nasa co-principal Raila Odinga for spreading propaganda about development done by his administration.He said Mr Odinga had failed to recognise growth spearheaded by his government."He will come here and lie yet he has used the same road we have built," he said in Voi, adding that his government always fulfils its promises.Similarly, DP Ruto spelt out the their achievements and urged locals to vote for Jubilee.

We therefore advise you to remove Ford Kenya from the register of political parties to enable us call fresh elections and whose members will mandate them (officials) to continue operationalizing the party democratically, Mr Komesa said in the letter received by the registrar Thursday.But Ford Kenya Secretary-General Eseli Simiyu dismissed Mr Komesa as a busybody being used by the party s enemies.

That letter is coming too late and the registrar will give a verdict, said Dr Simiyu.He went on: Mr Komesa is no longer the Nairobi chairman, he was removed.

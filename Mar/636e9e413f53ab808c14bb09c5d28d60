The Kenya Forest Service put out a fire that ravaged at least 2,000 hectares of Nanyuki Forest in Mt Kenya on Monday. The cause of the fire is yet to be known, according to the Nyeri KFS Zonal Manager Muchiri Mathinji. “Strong winds had earlier frustrated our efforts to put out the fire which in turn fanned it to spread fast to other areas within the forest. But slight showers that followed helped us contain the fire,” he said. He said the natural forest, mainly blue gum trees, that were burnt will be replanted. “Once the rains begin falling we will plant trees to cover much of the forest that have been destroyed,” he said. Mr Mathinji said the fire posed no danger to animals habituating in the forest. Earlier this year, KFS officials issued an alert warning of fire break outs due to hot weather.

Wednesday is International Women’s Day, an occasion to take stock of the gains and shortcomings for women. In Kenya and other parts of the world, women have always got the short end of the stick. They are discriminated against at the work place, suffer stereotypes and cultural impediments, and are generally locked out of key decision-making roles. However, we have made bold steps in ensuring gender equity, the most notable being the constitutional requirement that not more than two-thirds of any gender should hold public office. Affirmative action has been applied to university admission, where cut-off marks are lowered for women. However, women are still under-represented on the political and administrative fronts. There is not a single elected woman senator or governor. Only five women sit in a Cabinet of 18 ministers. Fewer women were appointed principal secretaries. Such gender imbalance calls for deliberate efforts to prop up women. A good beginning would be to aggressively implement the two-thirds gender rule in the coming General Election by electing more women. As we celebrate, we must deal with all the factors that slow down women’s progress.

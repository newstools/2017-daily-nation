Residents of Milimani estate in Nakuru County are in panic after fire broke out in Menengai Forest, which is close to their homes. The fast spreading inferno consumed over 200 acres of the indigenous forest towards Nakuru GK Prison. Kenya Forest Service Central Rift commandant David Mtoro said the agency's rangers tried to put it out. "We learnt of the fire at around 3pm and notified the county firefighters before we rushed to the scene," Mr Mtoro said. The cause of the fire is yet to be established.   A similar incident was witnessed in March 2015 when more than 300 acres of vegetation was destroyed by fire at Menengai Crater.

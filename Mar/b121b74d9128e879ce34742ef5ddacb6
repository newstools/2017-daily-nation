The Constituency Development Fund has revolutionised the implementation of development projects. This is not only evident on the ground, but has also been lately documented by the National Government Constituencies Development Fund Board, which oversees the effective and efficient management of these funds. Thanks to the CDF, some remote parts of the country that had never known tarmac roads, now boast stretches of bitumen. Through the CDF, the construction of schools, water supply, health facilities and other projects is going on countrywide. But the CDF has not been without shortcomings. The most pervasive is corruption and the overbearing influence of MPs, who appoint their cronies and close relatives in order to directly benefit from the projects. It is for this reason that the boardâ€™s role to ensure transparency and value for money is crucial. It is for this reason that the feting of constituencies for innovative use of funds is commendable. This public money is meant to help solve the perennial problems and here the benefits are evident, the managers deserve kudos. The board lists Kasipul in southern Nyanza and Kibra in Nairobi as the best performing constituencies. Also feted in the top 20 are mostly rural constituencies. This should encourage others to emulate the success by serving their people much better.

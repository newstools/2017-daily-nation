Jubilee Party has replaced Godfrey Pwoka Wanyonyi as chairman of its national election board due to professional wrongdoing. Head of the Secretariat Raphael Tuju said lawyer Lumatete Walubengo Muchai is the new chairman, and announced a countrywide exercise to set up county elections boards starting today. Mr Wanyonyi's short tenure, one week, is as a result of questions being raised about his integrity. Mr Tuju admitted that due diligence was not done prior to his appointment. “We have removed him because of integrity issue. Other members of the board are intact and ready to move,” he said.

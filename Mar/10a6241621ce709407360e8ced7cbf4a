Anxiety over the laying of three new tartan tracks for the IAAF World Under-18 Championships in Nairobi is over after the Public Procurement Review Board (PPRB) Tuesday dismissed an application stopping Spanish company Mondo from doing the works. Kenya’s Comnette Technologies Limited had filed a suit against the championships’ Local Organising Committee accusing the committee of breaking procurement laws by “by-passing” them to award the contract to the Spanish firm. Kenya is expected to host close to 3,000 athletes and officials from over 150 countries for the World Under-18 Championships from July 12 to 16 at Kasarani. FILED OUT OF TIME Due to this, the Moi International Sports Centre is undergoing major refurbishment along with the Kenyatta University’s sports grounds. The university will act as the athletes’ village for the championships. Both parties presented their case to the PPRB on Thursday last week but the board yesterday dismissed the case after the State raised the preliminary objection that the case was filed out of the required time. “We are happy that Mondo can now go on with its work,” said ministry of sports legal officer John Njogu.   There is also a total prize pool of $30,000 (Sh3 million) on offer for the inaugural relay race.

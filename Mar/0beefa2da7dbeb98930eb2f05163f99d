The National Environment Management Authority has said it will take legal action against Nyeri County officials for not getting rid off an illegal dumpsite situated within residential homes. The agency's director Patrick Ngatia gave officials in charge of environment to cleanup the site within the given time or risk being arrested and prosecuted. "As it is, the dumpsite is illegal and the officers responsible will be arrested for failing to comply with environmental regulations," Mr Ngatia said. Nema had given the county government six months to remove the dumpsite for it poses health hazards. Mr Steven Njoka, a resident of Asian Quarters, said: "Most of us are suffering from respiratory diseases because of the smoke that comes from the site when they burn [garbage]. We barely open windows because of the stench." The head of the environment department, John Mugenyu, said it might be removed in June. Mr Mugenyu said Sh20 million has been set aside to procure land, probably in Kieni West, where waste recycling will be done. "We are at a technical level of procuring the land and putting logistics together to have the dumpsite moved as soon as possible."

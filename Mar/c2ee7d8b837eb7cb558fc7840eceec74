The second annual summit for senators and members of county assemblies will be held in Mombasa next week. The conference, which will be held at Pride Inn Hotel, is the last one before Kenyans go to the general election in August. The forum is scheduled to take place from Monday to Friday next week. County Assemblies Forum (CAF)acting chairman Johnson Osoi said the summit aims at strengthening inter-governmental relations and enhance public participation in governance and devolution in general. Mr Osoi, who is also the Speaker of Kajiado County Assembly said the conference will also engage relevant officers and partners to facilitate smooth transition after the August elections. “The second legislative aims at assessing the implementation of the resolutions of the first annual legislative summit,” he said in a message published on the CAF website. The conference is also expected to provide a platform for participants to evaluate the performance of both levels of governments in matters of policy, law, accountability, good governance, and service delivery, among others. The forum is purely for senators and MCA, speakers, clerks and staff. Challenges that staff face in their work will be discussed as well as ways for strengthening process and mechanism that facilitate their work. The first summit was also held in Mombasa in May last year and was attended by 2,526 MCAs.

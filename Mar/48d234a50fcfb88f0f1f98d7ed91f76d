Singer Avril was last week on Wednesday named the brand ambassador of Itel Mobile. The popular singer revealed to Showbuzz that her management Kaka Empire surprised her with the news of the endorsement when it had already put everything into place. “My management was approached by Itel and had negotiations. Initially they didn’t tell me because they did not want to get my hopes up if something didn’t transpire. Then later they told me, ‘by the way there’s a phone company that would like to work with you, is it possible that you come to the meeting?’ The Yule Dame singer said. “I’m one of those people who doesn’t like getting too excited about something because I don’t like being disappointed,” she said adding that after negotiations, Itel were impressed with her made her the ambassador. Avril is still a brand ambassador for beauty company Oriflame and represents Cheza Cash, a betting company. “So many times when you venture into things, you don’t know that your brand will get you places so for me having my name alongside Itel is phenomenal and I’m extremely humbled. I am constantly surprised how my brand keeps on growing year after year, I never notice it until it happens. It’s exciting to associate myself with all these people especially seeing that the corporate sector is embracing the arts more than it used to,” she said.

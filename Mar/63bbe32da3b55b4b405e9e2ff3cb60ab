Security has been heightened in Baragoi, Samburu North after an attempted cattle raid that led to killing of one person while another injured. The deceased, believed to be from the Turkana community, was cornered by villagers in the 2am attack in Bendera village. According to the Samburu Police County commander Alfred Ageng'o, the attackers had ambushed a manyatta belonging to a Samburu. "The two who were armed with AK 47 riffles were repelled by the residents as they attempted to steal cattle late in the night, leading to the killing of one of them on the spot. "He was shot by livestock owners as one escaped into the bushes," said Mr Ageng'o in an interview with Nation on Sunday morning. The officer called for calm among residents, warning them of serious consequences against anyone found guilty of stealing livestock. He added that they have heightened security in the area to avoid further attacks as security officers peruse the escaped bandit. "We are vigilant on the ground and security operations are going on as we speak to make sure that peace and calm prevails in Baragoi. We are not going to relent on this until a lasting solution is found," Mr Ageng'o added. This is the fourth attack between the Samburu and Turkana communities where hundreds of animals have been stolen. A total of two people have been killed in Baragoi, three seriously injured in the last one and a half week. The attacks have led to retaliations from both sides as tension continues to rise. The body of the deceased moran was taken to Samburu County Referral Hospital Mortuary.   During the dawn attack a woman and her two children were shot dead.

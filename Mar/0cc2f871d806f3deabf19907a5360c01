LONDON Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny was sent off as Bayern Munich romped into the Champions League quarter-finals following a 5-1 thrashing on Tuesday gave them a crushing 10-2 aggregate success. Theo Walcott opened the scoring for the hosts in the first half giving them faint hope of overturning their 5-1 defeat from the last 16 first leg in Munich three weeks ago. But Frenchman Koscielny was controversially dismissed for bringing down Robert Lewandowski in the box on 54 minutes, ushering in a second half collapse from the hosts. The Poland international converted from the spot, Arjen Robben bagged the second on 68 minutes before Douglas Costa added the third 12 minutes from time. Arturo Vidal rounded off the second leg rout in the closing stages with a brace. Meanwhile, Dries Metens scored at both ends as Real Madrid beat Napoli 3-1 at the San Paolo to cruise into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 6-2 aggregate success. Belgian Mertens had given Napoli a 24th minute lead to halve the 3-1 deficit they had suffered in the last 16 first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu three weeks ago. But Sergio Ramos proved Real's unlikely hero, heading home a corner seven minutes into the second half before another set-piece header was inadvertently turned into his own net by Mertens. Alvaro Morata added gloss to the score in injury time.

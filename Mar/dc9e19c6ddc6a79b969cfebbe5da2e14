This year’s Safari Rally gets underway at Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi on March 17. The two-day rally, which is part of the Africa Rally Championship, will end at Afraha Stadium in Nakuru on March 18. Kenya is currently under scrutiny by the world motorsports governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (Fia). At stake is Kenya’s dream of making a return to the World Rally Championship (WRC) fold, having lost the status in 2002. While Fia president Jean Todt, who visited the country last year, supports the return of Safari Rally to the WRC, Kenya must fulfil stringent conditions before being allowed to become a candidate event next year with the possibility of returning to the WRC series in 2020. Some of the requirements are shortened races held on closed roads as well as financial muscle. Also, a digital radio system and a state-of-the-art timing system must be in place. The government has already committed to pay a promoter fee of Sh100 million for the WRC while the Kenya Motor Sports Federation has procured the timing machine. We can only wish our rally enthusiasts all the best.

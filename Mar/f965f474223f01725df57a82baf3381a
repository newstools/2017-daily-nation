Gurupreet Dhanjal need one point to stun a strong field that included national champion and record holder Gulraaj Sehmi to win the Teepol Cup at the General Service Unit (GSU) Training School shooting range in Embakasi, Nairobi County. The Super X Class marksman Dhanjal hauled a 12-round total of 585 points to clinch the overall title as players from Kenya Regiment Rifle Club (KRRC) dominated the small-bore championship that attracted 37 shooters. Sehmi, who a month ago had improved his own national record to 596, won Super X Class honours with his score of 584, beating his father, legendary Satinder Sehmi to second place on 582 points. BROKE KRRC’S DOMINANCE It’s GSU marksman David Kirui who broke KRRC’s dominance to finish third in the Super X Class on 581 points. What powered Dhanjal to victory was his first phase of six-round total of 293 that was the best on the day, followed by a final six-round total of 292. Sehmi and Satinder might have shot the best and final round of 294 each, but Dhanjal had done enough in the first phase to gurantee himself victory. Sehmi and Satinder had shot 290 and 288 in the first phase. Jaswinder Padam (KRRC) carded 570 to win X Class, beating Moses Wachira from Kenya Defence Forces on 566 and Roy Pattni (KRRC) 563 respectively, while Maurice Morara (GSU) claimed ‘O’ Class honours on 575 points, edging Sunny Sian (KRRC) and Joyce Chebii (KDF) on 570 and 566 respectively. Honours in T Class went to Preeyam Sehmi (KRRC) on 566 as Sanford Otundo (GSU) and Francis Kinyua (DCI) wound up second and third respectively in the category.

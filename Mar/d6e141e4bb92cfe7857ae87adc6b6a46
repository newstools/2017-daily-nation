The account holding pay cuts for President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy and top public servants has Sh64.9 million, Treasury CS Henry Rotich said on Monday. Based on the number of expected contributors, the account shows that some top public officials have defied calls to have their pay reduced. The Transformative Fund was opened in 2014 to hold deductions from salaries of top civil servants in an effort to cut the ballooning public wage bill and free up cash for development. This came after President Kenyatta ordered the salary reduction three years ago. “Voluntary pay cut account stands at Sh64,936,166 as at March 24, 2017,” Mr Rotich said.

In March 2014, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto pledged to take a 20 per cent pay cut as part of broader efforts to narrow the public wage bill. He also directed ministers, principal secretaries and parastatal heads — estimated to be more than 200 — to take pay cuts ranging from 10 to 20 per cent, warning that those who defied the order would be dismissed. Ministers promised to reduce their pay by 10 per cent.   President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced that he and Deputy President William Ruto will be taking a 20 per cent cut on their salaries.

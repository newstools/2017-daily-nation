A Ceska pistol was on Friday found abandoned at Avenue Hospital in Kisumu. A cleaner came across the firearm in the hospital’s compound and reported to an administrator who later alerted the police. According to Kisumu County Commission Maalim Muhammed, the firearm belonged to a police officer who perished in a recent road crash that happened on the Kisumu-Kakamega road. “We lost the pistol in a recent crash that involved a prison bus and a matatu. The police officers were from Vihiga County after attending a colleague’s burial,” he said.

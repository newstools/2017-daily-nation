Nairobi deputy governor Jonathan Mueke has donated 72 choir uniforms to Ndururuno Primary School pupils in Huruma through the Ficha uchi initiative. The Ficha Uchi programme since it was initiated in 2013 has seen 2,800 pupils benefit with school uniforms in a move that is made to restore dignity, self-esteem and confidence as students no longer have to go to school in tattered uniforms. Speaking during the donation the County Chief Officer for Education Mr Andrew Mwanthi said that through the programme the County has been able to address some of the education related problems and provided some schools with solutions apart from just giving uniforms. Mr Mwathi said that the school is among other 28 schools in the county that have benefitted in the uniform distribution. He added that the county has also been involved in other projects in the school as it has also contributed in the construction of a perimeter wall, repair of classroom roofs and school feeding programme that was a partnership with the world food programme. "The Governor and the deputy have single-handedly given more than Sh80 million in bursaries to over 700 students in Nairobi County to enable poor but academically gifted students pursue further education,‚Äù said Mr Mwathi. Ficha Uchi initiative has also benefitted over 50 tailors who have been given job opportunities as they make uniforms for different schools. Ficha Uchi University chapters have also been formed in over five institutions, the latest one being Kenyatta University and Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. Some of the schools that have so far benefited from the Ficha Uchi programme include; Mathari Old Primary, Kiboro Primary, Valley Bridge, Salama, Mcedo Beijing, Genesis Primary, New Pumwani, Child Survival, Pumwani, Race Course primary, Old Kibra, Ayany, Raila Odinga Education Centre, Muslim Primary in Kawangware, Ofafa Jericho, Langata Primary School and Madaraka Primary School among others.

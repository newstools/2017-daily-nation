Kakamega County Assembly has become the first regional House to pass a Bill that allows it to have an anthem. Kakamega County Flag, Emblems and Names (Amendment) Bill 2017, sponsored by the executive, will enable the county to include the anthem in its instruments of power. While contributing to the debate, Marama West Ward representative Habil Nanjendo said they are making laws for posterity. The Bill allows both English and Kiswahili versions of the county anthem. Nominated MCA Dorcas Mulwale said the Assembly will be remembered by future generations for passing a Bill that uphold county heritage and culture. “We are proud as pioneer MCAs for being able to pass a Bill that will enable the county have its own anthem,” she said. According to the Bill, any person who shows disrespect in speech or writing to the county anthem shall be liable, upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding Sh10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. The Assembly also passed the Kakamega County Order of Precedence Bill 2017, which stipulates the protocol around senior state officers. Public Service Committee Chairperson Reuben Nyangweso, who tabled the Bill, said the law will help in bringing order during public functions in the county.

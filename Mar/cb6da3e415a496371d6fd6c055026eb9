Delegates attending the Fourth Annual Devolution Conference in Naivasha, Nakuru County began the second day of the forum with a short celebration of the 2017 International Women's Day. At a session chaired by former cabinet minister and academician, Prof Margaret Kamar, the women in the room did a round of the "woman dance" to celebrate the Kenyan woman as they joined the world in recognising the day. During the opening prayer, Ms Judith Miguda-Attyang prayed for women in their daily struggles as well as those in various professions who are trying hard to make a difference as leaders. She also prayed to God to help men in leadership to realise that "the two-thirds rule has hit a snag because men don't find it fit to support it." Later, Ms Ngina Kimani, the youngest participant aged 18, read the message to mark the special women's day. GENDER RULE Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa wished the Kenyan women well, saying they deserve recognition and appreciation. The minister singled out for praise, Ms Winfred Lichuma, the National Gender and Equality Commission chairperson for years of fighting for the rights of women and girls. Mr Wamalwa regretted that Parliament is yet to agree on the two-third gender rule. "It is sad that we have not achieved the gender rule as a parliament leaving us as the regional dwarf," the minister said. He later made a presentation on the progress made in empowering communities in the management of natural resources.

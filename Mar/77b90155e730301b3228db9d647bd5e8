Muslims in Mombasa on Friday held special prayers for peace before and after the August 8 General Election and for besieged Governor Hassan Joho. They met at Caltex ground in Likoni under the aegis of Majlisi Mudarasini (Union of Madrasa Teachers) of Shikaadabu, South Coast. Sheikh Mahmud Mwinyi, who is the Imam of Masjid Khadijah Chidunguni, and Sheikh Iddi Nzala led the adhuhuri (afternoon) prayers. They also prayed for rain following a prolonged dry spell that has caused famine and deaths. “These prayers are not specifically for Governor Joho but for all political leaders and more so, for peace in the country. We have been seeing worrying trends with political temperatures rising ahead of the August polls,” said Sheikh Mahmud. It had earlier been announced that the prayers were special ones for Governor Joho who allegedly forged his Form Four certificates. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya Mombasa chairman Abdallah Mohamed said it was prudent to seek the guidance of God in the way the issues on the governor were being handled. Speaking during a meeting with other clerics from the county at Treasury Square, Sheikh Mohamed said: “We saw the issues that surrounded Governor Joho at first as political but they seem to be ‘personal’ by leaning on one person, which to us is not fair at all,” said Sheikh Mohamed. The sheikhs denied holding the prayers specifically for the besieged Governor. Two cameramen from the office of the Governor were also present. The office also sent a water and tents to the venue.

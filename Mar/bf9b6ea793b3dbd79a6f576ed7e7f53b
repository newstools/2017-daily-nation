Bongo sensation Diamond Platnumz has had such a successful career that it is simply quite hard to imagine that one of the most famous musicians in East Africa at one point was not sure how his career would turn out.One of Diamond s managers Hamisi Taletale, also known as Babu Tale went down memory lane on Instagram recounting how they came to Kenya for the first time to record the video for the song Kesho and they did not know how things would turn out. Nakumbuka hii ilikua siku ya kwanza kupanda ndege pamoja na mwanangu @diamondplatnumz na tulikua tunaenda Kenya kufanya video ya Kesho. Nakumbuka njia nzima tulikua tunajipa moyo uku tukiamini ipo siku Mungu atatuona, kisa tulipanda ndege na tulikua atujui uko tunapoenda tutafikia wapi coz wote tulikua wageni mix atuyajui mambo ya video za ugenini. Asante Mungu kwa kila jambo, he wrote.Kesho was released in 2012.That seems to be in the past now as Diamond is no longer worried about shooting videos in foreign countries. Instead, he is dealing with a new set of problems , like receiving calls from President Magufuli mid-interview. The star was a on a television interview on Clouds TV 360 Live, addressing artistes challenges and what do you know, President Magufuli called in during the show saying he had heard his pleas and congratulated him for putting Tanzania on the map. email print email print Villagers set alight seven houses to avenge the killing woman at Riabotenene Village in Kisii.

Taita Taveta Deputy Governor Mary Ndiga Kibuka has denied having differed with Governor John Mruttu. Ms Ndiga said she fully supports Mr Mruttu and his re-election bid. “The media reports that I am among deputy governors who are not in good terms with their governors are false,” Ms Ndiga said. Speaking to the Nation by phone, Ms Ndiga said she supports Mr Mruttu’s re-election and will continue backing his leadership. “I am with the governor,” she added. Ms Ndiga is among leaders who accompanied Mr Mruttu, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Kilifi’s Amason Kingi and other ODM leaders in drumming up support for the party and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga to be president during rallies in Taita Taveta last week.   Mombasa governor Hassan Joho is burning midnight oil to get a deputy. #ElectionsKE

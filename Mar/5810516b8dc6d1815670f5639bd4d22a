Details have emerged of how a bus driver, who was walking home after a night of merrymaking, was reportedly stabbed to death after an altercation with a motorist in Kasarani, Nairobi. Police are now looking for the motorist who sped off from the scene after the Wednesday midnight incident. Noel Manthi, a student at Kenyatta University, said his uncle, 36-year-old Francis Mangau, and the motorist exchanged abusive words before the latter stabbed his uncle and drove off. “We had just alighted from a matatu at Roysambu. We were walking to the nearby stage to board another matatu to my uncle’s home at Kasarani. There was this vehicle that had stopped near the roundabout, blocking the way and it had rained heavily ,” he told the Nation. “Mbona unasimamisha gari hapa? Unafikiri nitapitia wapi? (Why are you stopping your car here? Where am I supposed to pass through?),” he recalls his uncle asking the motorist before the argument degenerated into insults. “The argument had gone on for less than 10 minutes when the motorist alighted and said, “You don’t know who you are joking with,” Mr Manthi said, adding it was at this point that the motorist stabbed his uncle. Mr Mangau was declared dead at Guru Nanak Hospital. Mr Manthi described the attacker’s car as a white Toyota Wish. His uncle was a bus driver on the Nairobi-Machakos route. Kasarani police commander Robinson Mboloi said: “We have launched investigations. First we want to get the car and its owner”. Earlier in the day, the victim had visited his nephew at the university and they spent the evening together before the tragic events of the evening.

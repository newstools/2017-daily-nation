University students have petitioned Members of Parliament to end the ongoing lecturers’ strike that has crippled learning activities in the institutions of higher learning. Student leaders drawn from both public and private universities, have written to the National Assembly demanding for urgent and immediate resolution to the stalemate. Led by Moi University’s Nairobi campus chairman Edwin Kegoli, the students argued that the strike poses a great risk to learning in the institutions. “The strike has affected consistency and length of the academic calendar, Academic extension and research activities,” they said. Lectures from all the 33 public universities and all their constituent colleges went on strike on January 12, demanding that the 2013-2017 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) be agreed upon, signed and implemented. However, despite engaging in negotiations with the Inter Public Universities Council Consultative Forum, the lecturers union, the University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) have not agreed. The lecturers have since rejected a Sh10 billion offered by their employer for all university staff. Most affected by the strike are students pursuing scientific research, the leaders said explaining that such students depend on their lecturers for guidance. “That it is within the authority of the National Assembly under the provision of the constitution to deliberate and resolve issues of concern to the people,” the students argued in their petition.   Education CS maintains that he would uphold the law and playing by the rules.

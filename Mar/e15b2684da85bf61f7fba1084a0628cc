A man who admitted taking part in the murder of Kiru Boys’ Secondary School Solomon Mwangi has been slapped with a seven-year jail term. Joseph Njuguna, alias Karis, pleaded guilty to manslaughter charges, saying he accepted to do the dirty job after being promised Sh400,000 by Mr Mwangi’s wife Jane Muthoni Mbuthi. While handing down the sentence, High Court Judge Joel Ngugi on Thursday objected an application by the prosecution and the defence to have the accused given a noncustodial. The two sides had made the request, arguing that Njuguna was remorseful and had helped the prosecution to unearth the murder. Although the accused did not directly take part in planning and executing the murder, the judge said, Njuguna, who has named Mr Mwangi's wife as the perpetrator, failed to act in order to stop a murder he was privy to. He described his actions as "wanton disregard to human life."  More follows.   Jane Muthoni faces charges of murdering her husband Solomon Mwangi.

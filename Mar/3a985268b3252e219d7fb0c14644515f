Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga has urged party supporters to remain united after primaries. Mr Odinga said the nominations could make or break a political party as it happened in UK leading to the Labour Party to lose thrice to the Conservative Party. "If you are not satisfied with outcome, follow the laid down procedures of resolving disputes. Don't hire youths or hooligans because this hurts women candidates and disadvantages them,” Mr Odinga said. He continued: “Let us give consensus a chance where possible. The aim is to fight a common enemy — Jubilee — with the strongest teams. Let's end our internal wrangles." Mr Odinga was addressing Coast ODM aspirants at Jubilee Hall in Mombasa on Saturday. ODM deputy party leader who is also Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho asked the party aspirants to keep peace before and during primaries. He denied influencing the exercise in Kwale, Lamu and Kilifi counties. "Some of our candidates are weak but make the greatest noise. They incite their few supporters to cause chaos. I warn you that you will be disqualified. This journey is long and difficult. We must fight Uhuru and Ruto government because we can't stand the corruption which surpasses all previous governments. This government is full of theft, has heightened poverty and bad governance,” he said. Party secretary general Agnes Zani said despite personal interests, "the party is bigger than those interests.” “ODM is not a political party but a mass movement of people with a similar agenda of liberation. We stand for ending historical injustices and improving Kenyans' lives,” she said.

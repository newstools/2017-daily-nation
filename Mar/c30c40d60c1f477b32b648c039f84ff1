Meru Governor Peter Munya has bowed to pressure from his close political opponent, Senator Kiraitu Murungi, and said the county will list all projects undertaken by his government.Although he admitted he has not met all development pledges made before the 2013 elections, Mr Munya said he had done a lot for the people of Meru.He said the county government is preparing a report highlighting its key achievements in different sectors.He spoke at a function to endorse the Party of National Unity (PNU) senatorial aspirant Mugambi Imanyara at Kaguru Farmers Training Centre in South Imenti near Senator Murungi s home.Last week, the senator challenged the county administration to list all its development accomplishments and account for more than Sh25 billion it has received from the National Treasury.KIKALI TEAM The problem with the Kikali (Kiraitu, Kajuju and Linturi team) is that they have been in Nairobi and not at the grassroots. The truth is that there is no other county that has delivered like Meru, Mr Munya said. If Senator Murungi has been South Imenti MP for over 20 years and still there many problems bedevilling its people, how am I expected to deliver all pledges in four years of governance? What magic can I do within that short period? he posed.At the same time, Governor Munya questioned the senator s interests in the race to be Meru governor saying he is driven by the need to control resources.Senator Murungi has said he only wants one term as a governor. There was an agreement that Tiganias retain the governor s seat for 10 years and a similar period for the Imenti with the senator s position. What has changed that he wants my position?

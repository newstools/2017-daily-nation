Doctors working in Kwale County who fail to report to work on Monday will be sacked. Health executive Athuman Chiguzo said the doctor’s strike is illegal and said disciplinary action will be taken against those who defy the directive. “Doctors who fail to resume duty as directed will face the sack,” he said. He however said a legal action will be taken only if a clear communication from the President’s office or Council of Governors office is presented. Government policies, he said, are implemented through circulars and that is what he is waiting for, as a legal protection when taking action on striking doctors. Even though he is yet to receive a communication on the sacking of doctors on strike, he insisted that doctors should return to work before any negotiations can continue. He said the county has already issued letters to the doctors to return to work.Doctors have been on strike for three months in a bid to compel the government to implement a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) signed in 2013 of 300 per cent salary increment and improved working conditions.However, Mr Chiguzo said the strike has been politicised and demands made by the doctors were unrealistic and unattainable.Despite numerous talks to have the doctors return to work spearheaded by the ministry of health and Council of Governors no consensus has been reached.

Police in Chuka have destroyed bhang with estimated street value of ShSh3.5 million. The drug was dug up in Mount Kenya forest last month by police, Kenya Forest Service rangers and locals. Chuka/Igambangombe deputy county commissioner Omar Sarat said the bhang was planted on one and a half-acres of land. Mr Sarat said people who reside near the forest had raised complaints over increased drug peddling. "We have noticed that there are other parcels of land in the forest where the drug is planted and we will make sure we have destroyed it all," he said. He warned that drug dealers will be prosecuted. Mr Sarat observed that lives of youth in Tharaka Nithi County have been ruined by drug abuse, calling on the residents to volunteer information that will help in the war on drugs. "I urge the locals to work with the police in ensuring that those planting the harmful drug are arrested and prosecuted." However, he said no suspects have been arrested in connection with the destroyed drug; but investigations are ongoing.

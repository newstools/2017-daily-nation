Police shot dead three suspected Pokot bandits in Mukutani in Baringo South after they tried to attack mourners on Saturday. The suspected bandits tried to attack the Ilchamus people who were at a burial for more than 10 people who had been killed on Tuesday in Mukutani when suspected Pokot bandits invaded the area. According to Ilchamus spokesman Amos Olempaka, at 3pm, armed bandits stormed the church compound where the burial was taking place. “We were at the Full Gospel Church when we saw three armed men coming towards the church. The police responded immediately and killed them,” Mr Olempaka said. Tension ran high in the area after the shooting and the burial was disrupted. “In fact we conducted the burial with mourners standing because we feared more attacks,” he said. Mr Olempaka said after the ambush, they performed the burials in a hurry and left immediately after the police ordered them to do so. He said that on their way to Marigat, the suspected bandits had barricaded roads in Tigaluk and shot in the air but police officers repulsed them.

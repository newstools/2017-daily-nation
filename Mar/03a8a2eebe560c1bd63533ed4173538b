A plenary session at the second annual Legislative Summit turned chaotic after National Cohesion and Integration Commission Chairman Francis ole Kaparo clashed with Orange Democratic Movement secretary-general Agnes Zani over the preparedness of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to hold this year's General Election.It started when Dr Zani took more time to ask questions than the time allocated by Mr Kaparo, who was the moderator of the session.Efforts by Mr Kaparo to stop her presentation fell on deaf ears as Dr Zani kept on hammering points that the electoral commission was not ready for the polls.

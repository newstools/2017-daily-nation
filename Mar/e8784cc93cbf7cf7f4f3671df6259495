A parliamentary committee has recommended a lifestyle audit on former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru over the National Youth Service (NYS) scandal. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) also called for prosecution of Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and others over the scandal. CBK BOSS The MPs also recommended that Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge be investigated. In a report tabled in the House Thursday afternoon, the PAC also recommended that Ms Waiguru be barred from holding office if found guilty after due process because of her overall failures at the ministry. This would also be because of contravention of Chapter Six of the Constitution. "Aware of the existence of a Cabinet resolution on the enhanced functions of a Cabinet Secretary as resolved vide the resolution of the 11th Cabinet meeting held on 2nd November 2014, she failed to execute the said enhanced functions," the committee said. LAW FIRMS Mr Murkomen is to be charged along with his partners at the firm of Sing'oei, Murkomen and Sigei Advocates. The Senator's firm declined to submit bank statements and other documents deemed necessary to aid investigations. The committee also recommended the law firms of MM Gitonga and Advocates and Ogola and Mujera be prosecuted for aiding and abetting money laundering.   MP says team members are at odds over sanctions against Murkomen.

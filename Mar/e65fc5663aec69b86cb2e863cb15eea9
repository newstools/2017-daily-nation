The Kenya Scouts Association has elected Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi as its new chief scout. Prof Kaimenyi replaced Mr Francis Ole Kaparo, the chairman of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, who had been at the helm for 14 years. Speaking during the Annual General Meeting at Rowallan scouts camp in Nairobi, Prof Kaimenyi urged scouts countrywide to continue being messengers of peace as the country gears up for elections. In February last year during a memorial service for founders of the scouts movement - Lord Baden Powell and his wife Olave - Prof Kaimenyi promised to issue title deeds to scouts centres. "We assure that in the next few months we will issue title deeds to all centres in all counties," he said. Mr Kaparo urged leaders to desist from abusive politics and to learn to handle losses and wins well so that there can be peace in the country. He also said voters need to elect leaders of integrity and shun negative tribalism. According to information on its website, the Kenya Scouts Association is the largest youth movement in the country with a membership of more than one million.

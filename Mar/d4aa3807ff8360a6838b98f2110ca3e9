The National Assembly has started investigating National Land Commission Chairman Muhamad Swazuri for corruption. This follows a petition submitted to the House by a Mr Mugo Njeru. Mr Njeru accuses Mr Muhamad of defrauding his (Mr Njeruâ€™s) wife of the cash she had been awarded as compensation by the land commission. In the petition, the petitioner also claims that Dr Swazuri has used his position to enrich himself illegally. Temporary Speaker Jessica Mbalu on Thursday handed over the matter to the House Lands Committee. "The committee has 14 days within which to submit a report to the House as required by the Standing Orders...which in this case is on or before April 7," said Ms Mbalu.

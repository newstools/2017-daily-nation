Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri has assured all clinical officers that they will receive improved allowances from this month. Dr Muraguri said a memo had already been sent to all county governments and health departments directing them to improve pay for workers in 17 categories, excluding doctors and nurses, from March this year. Addressing journalists at the Lamu King Fahd County Hospital on Friday, Dr Muraguri said the National Treasury has already approved the allowances and will be factored in the county budgets. “The new allowances are aimed at improving the terms of service of health workers in the country, many of whom have to endure long strenuous working hours,” he said. Clinical officers and other health workers had demanded that they be paid a Sh20,000 healthcare allowance. Clinical officers demanded an Sh10,000 for call allowance. Lamu Health Executive Mohamed Kombo welcomed the move stating that the pay rise would end go slow by health workers. Health workers, including clinical workers in several counties had downed their tools to demand better pay. They have been demanding for promotions, better pay and improved allowances, saying their terms of service were demoralising.   They marched to Governor Hassan Joho's office to present their grievances.

President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party has gone full-throttle to target its opponents in Nasa (National Super Alliance) in a bid to show its ability to win the August General Election. President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have termed the defections as adding to their bid to unite the country and to push a “development-conscious” agenda which can only be realised in Jubilee. On Tuesday, Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani led four ODM legislators from, 25 county assembly members and more than 300 elders representing the 15 groups of peoples living in the county in supporting the President’s re-election. But they will do so from their new home, Frontier Alliance Party, which they decamped to from ODM. The leaders met President Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, the third such event in less than seven days. NO INTERFERENCE “You are all mine and I promise you there will be no interference and as you compete do it in a civilised manner because at the end of the day the winner will be ours and the loser will still be ours,” said the President at State House, Nairobi, on Tuesday. The MPs were Roba Duba (Moyale), Chachu Ganya (North Horr), Nasra Ibrahim (Women Rep) and Joseph Lekuton (Laisamis).

The governor becomes the latest in the list of governors and senior politicians to defect from the opposition to rally behind President Kenyatta’s re-election. During his Coast tour two days ago, President Kenyatta received Tana River Governor Hussein Dado and Women Representative Halima Ware among other politicians.

INDIAN WELLS Australian star Nick Kyrgios withdrew from his ATP Indian Wells Masters showdown with Roger Federer on Friday, blaming food poisoning for a sudden illness that left him unable to play. "Unfortunately I am unable to play today due to sickness," Kyrgios said on Twitter. "At this stage we think it's food poisoning, and I'm praying it's nothing more." Kyrgios had been due to face Federer in Friday's quarter-finals after knocking out Novak Djokovic in the last 16 on Wednesday.   Federer dismantled the Spaniard 6-2, 6-3.

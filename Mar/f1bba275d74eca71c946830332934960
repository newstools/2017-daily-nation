A Nanyuki court has ordered that a suspect in the murder of Laikipia rancher Tristan Voorspuy be detained at the local police station for two weeks. Samson Lokayi appeared in court on Tuesday to answer murder charges but he did not take plea after police said they needed more time to complete investigation. He is expected back in court on March 28. Detectives said they have strong reasons to believe Mr Lokayi fired the bullet that ended the life of the 61-year-old rancher who co-owns Sosian Ranch. State counsel Cecilia Kinyanjui told senior resident magistrate Evans Ngige the suspect had no permanent home or occupation and it would be hard to trace him once released on bond. She added that investigators would have to travel to the interior of Baringo where Mr Lokayi comes from. “The suspect was arrested in Nyahururu town following intelligence reports that he took part in the murder with two others still at large,” she said.

Members of Parliament from Turkana County have appealed to the State to beef up security in North Rift areas where conflicts are rife. While supporting the ongoing security operation in Kerio Valley, Turkana South MP James Lomenen and his Turkana East counterpart Nicholas Ngikor said that the end result must be law and order. Mr Ngikor claimed that armed bandits from Tiaty in Baringo County are crossing over to Turkana to avoid being nabbed. "We want the security operation to be boosted in all hotspot regions in the North Rift so that we talk about development after the exercise," he said. Mr Lomenen advised the government not to take sides and to ensure that banditry is stamped out because it has derailed development. The lawmaker observed that some schools have been closed due to frequent attacks that have led to deaths and migration to safer places. "Any person inciting youth to engage in banditry must be dealt with accordingly, even if is my relative. We need total peace after the operation," he said. One of the county where people have been killed and families displaced is Baringo. Recently the Deputy President William Ruto ordered police to shoot and kill bandits.

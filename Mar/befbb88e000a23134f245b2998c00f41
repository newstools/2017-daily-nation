The Local Organising Committee of the World Under-18 Championships has denied allegations it unprocedurally awarded contracts and called for a public hearing of an inquest into the matter. Chief Executive Officer of the committee Mwangi Muthee has said the contract it awarded to Spanish company Mondo Sport and Flooring to lay three tartan tracks at Kasarani Stadium and at Kenyatta University training ground was above board as went through all procurement procedures. Mondo is a partner of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and specialises in the laying of synthetic sports surfaces and manufacturing of various sports products. In a press statement Tuesday, the committee asked the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (PPARB) to open up its session to the media and members of the public when it reviews the matter tomorrow to avoid misinformation.” Muthee said the committee had advertised tenders for the contract last year. “We have four months to the championships and the provision for IAAF partners to do the job is clear. The process of awarding Mondo the contract was procedural and in line with the national procurement process,” said Muthee. “As a sign of good faith and openness to the public and to the committee, everyone should be welcome to the session before the Review Board,” Muthee said. Muthee explained that local contractor, Comnette Technology, which have appealed against award of the contract to Mondo was until a few weeks ago a tenant at Kasarani and are mainly suppliers of stationery.

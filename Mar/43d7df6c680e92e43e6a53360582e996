Calm has returned at Maseno School after a day-long unrest by students that paralysed learning at the institution on Wednesday. The students went on rampage protesting the interdiction of their Principal Paul Otula over bullying claims at the institution. Speaking to Nation.co.ke, Kisumu County Education Director Sabina Aroni said students had resumed learning. “I received a report in the morning that the students went for morning preps. That is a good indication. I am visiting the school to further check the state of affairs,” said Ms Aronii. Mr Otula was suspended for 30 days by the Teachers’ Service Commission following claims that a Form One student was sodomised by senior students. He is expected face a disciplinary committee to defend himself against accusations of negligence, allowing bullying and molestation of the student. Homa Bay High School Principal Andrew Buop was posted in Mr Otula’s place. This caused unrest among the students who demanded that Mr Otula be reinstated. It is however unclear whether the new principal has reported to the institution as both Ms Aroni and Kisumu County TSC Director Ado Mohammed chose to steer off the matter. Mr Mohammed said due to its seriousness, the matter was being handled from the headquarters. “It is best to reach the communications desk at the TSC headquarters for details,” he said. The issue is deemed emotive since both parents and students want Mr Otula reinstated. The Maseno School Parents Association chairperson James Obondi accused the ministry of education and the media of creating unnecessary stigma on their sons regarding the sodomy allegations. “We find the allegations on sodomy in the school as baseless, unjustifiable and in the least, malicious and aimed at tainting the name of the institution and Mr Otula,” said Obondi.

Enough has been said about the huge disappointment South Sudan has turned out to be. All the hope about stability and prosperity of Africa’s youngest nation have gone down the drain as its leaders continue their bloody rivalry for power. But bearing the brunt of the failed dream are not just the citizens of this country that has seen too much suffering for several years now, but also the entire region. As a new member of the East African Community, South Sudan had been expected to be the new frontier for the expansion of trade and investment. Instead, it has become the veritable killing fields of the region, and business is now at a standstill. For Kenya, and other EAC members, the mess in Juba is not just a lost opportunity, it is a source of seemingly never-ending pain. And the news of the killing of six aid workers in a relief convoy is another manifestation of the country’s continued slide into the abyss. The attack in which three of the victims were Kenyans, is a blow to humanitarian efforts. There are also reports of a number of Kenyans being held in jails after kangaroo trials. The warring leaders have let down not just their people, but also the neighbouring countries that for several decades hosted South Sudanese refugees. The international community and the regional leaders must do more to help restore peace and tranquility in South Sudan.

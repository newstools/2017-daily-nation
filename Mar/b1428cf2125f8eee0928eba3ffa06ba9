Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has warned cartels involved in land grabbing in the city against invading public land meant for development especially for schools. Dr Kidero said that a total of 1, 180 pieces of public land meant for public use have been grabbed and that the county was in the process of taking them back to public use. “We will not allow selfish individuals to take land meant for school development for our children and turn it into their own use. This terrible habit of stealing public land must stop,” he said while speaking at Garden Estate Secondary School which has been in the news after a private developer claimed ownership of the school’s field. He claimed that former councillors of the defunct City Council were the individuals at the centre of land grabbing. “The former city council and former councillors had the horrible habit of stealing land and this is a classic example. This was never given out as it is a public utility. “We will ensure that this land is used for what it was meant for,” said the governor. The governor also said that he has reigned on the grabbers and prevented them from grabbing three pieces of land in three schools in Nairobi – Our Lady of Mercy land in Shauri Moyo, Kamukunji and Uhuru Secondary schools. Dr Kidero hit at those coalescing around Nairobi Governorship seat aspirant Peter Kenneth saying that they are land grabbers who have amassed billions of shillings and are now trying to fight him because he has brought an end to their shady land deals. “There are people opposed to me because I have refused them to continue stealing public land and so long as I am the governor which I will continue up to 2022 no school land will be stolen,” said Kidero. He also called on Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaiserry to take charge of security in the country and ensure that peace prevails ahead of start of campaigns for the August polls.

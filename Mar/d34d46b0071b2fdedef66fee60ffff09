WASHINGTON San Antonio Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge has been benched indefinitely after suffering a minor heart arrhythmia, the NBA team announced on Saturday. Aldridge has averaged 17.3 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.0 assists a game for the Spurs, who at 50-14 own the second-best record in the NBA this season, trailing only the Golden State Warriors at 52-13. "All parties have concluded that at the current time it is best for Aldridge to refrain from play until further tests and examinations are completed," the Spurs said in a statement, without giving details of Aldridge's irregular heartbeat episode. In April of 2007, at the end of his rookie season with the Portland Trail Blazers, Aldridge missed the final nine games of the season after being diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, an abnormality that can cause a rapid heartbeat. Aldridge, 31, underwent a procedure to fix the problem and in 2011 underwent the same procedure and missed time at the start of the 2011-12 campaign when the condition recurred. Aldridge, a five-time NBA All-Star, is in his second season with the Spurs after nine seasons with the Trail Blazers. Also ruled out for Saturday's much-diminished showdown with Golden State were point guards Tony Parker, the Frenchman suffering from a stiff back, and Dejounte Murray, with tightness in the groin. The Spurs had already ruled out forward Kawhi Leonard due to a concussion. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he would rest starters Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson plus top reserve Andre Iguodala for the game in San Antonio.

The case of a 10- year- old pupil, who died after allegedly being beaten by a teacher, suffered a setback after Chief Government Pathologist Johansen Oduor requested for more time to conduct further tests.A post-mortem on the body of Joy Waguthi was conducted in February and the results were set to be released after 30 days but police said the government pathologist has requested an additional week to run more tests. Laikipia Central Divisional Criminal Investigations Officer Joseph Indeke told the Nation on phone that the results were to be handed to the police on Friday last week. “I travelled to Nairobi to get the results but they were not ready. The pathologist said he would like one more week to conduct a few other tests before drafting the final report,” said Mr Indeke. Police are yet to prefer charges against the teacher as they are waiting for the report that will ascertain the cause of the pupil’s death. The teacher, Mr Venezio Njuguna was released on a personal bond of Sh100,000 as the prosecution had not formulated charges against him. He had already been in police custody for 14 days. Mr Njuguna was released on bond and instructed not to leave the jurisdiction of the Nanyuki Law courts and also to keep away from Mukandamia Primary School where the pupil was allegedly beaten prior to her death.   Prosecutors still awaiting post-mortem results on the pupil.

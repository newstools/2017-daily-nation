Tusker winger Noah Wafula scored the first goal of the 2017 SportPesa Premier League season in their opening match against Nzoia Sugar at Afraha Stadium on Saturday. Wafula scored with a low shot against the run of play in the 10th minute after the Premier League new boys started the match on a high. Elvis Rupia, former of Nakuru AllStars, had twice threatened to open the scoring for Nzoia before Wafula struck from a Tusker counter.

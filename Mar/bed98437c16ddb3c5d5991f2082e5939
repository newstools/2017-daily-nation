A 71 year old woman died while her husband suffered serious burns after their house was gutted by fire on Sunday morning. Reports indicate that the couple was sleeping in their three-bedroomed house when the fire started at around 3am. Due to a two-day electricity blackout in Ndurutu, Nyeri County, the couple had been using a candle to light their house. Their son spotted the fire and alerted the neighbours. His father is undergoing treatment at Consolata Mathari Mission Hospital and his late mother's body has been taken to Nyeri County Referral Hospital. Nyeri Central Assistant County Commissioner John Marete said that investigations are under way to ascertain the cause of the fire. "The wife perished but the man is receiving treatment because he also inhaled a lot of smoke. Initial reports indicate the fire was started by a candle they were using, but investigations are ongoing," Mr Marete said.

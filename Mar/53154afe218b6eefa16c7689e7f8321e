All teachers in nursery schools across the country will only be allowed to teach after being registered by the Teachers Service Commission. TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia cautioned both public and private schools against hiring teachers who are not registered. “Early Childhood and Development and Education (ECDE) teachers engaged in teaching service, whether in public or private educational institutions, without certificate of registration must immediately register with TSC,” said Ms Macharia. She said the registration would be done online. READ: Knut demands quick registration of ECDE teachers The decision follows a High Court ruling last year when Justice Edward Muriithi said it was the sole mandate of TSC to register all trained teachers, including ECDE teachers. The ruling ended a two-year long standoff between the TSC and the county governments on who had the mandate on matters to do with hiring of the teachers. Knut went to court in 2014 protesting a decision by some county governments to directly hire ECDE teachers. The court also ruled that county governments handle employment of ECDE teachers and provide necessary infrastructure for education at this level. According to Knut Secretary-General Wilson Sossion, there are currently over 110,000 ECDE teachers already employed by county governments, churches, NGOs and private individuals, who are not members of the union.

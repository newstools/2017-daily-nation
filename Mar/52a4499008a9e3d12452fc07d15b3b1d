More than 600 needy students from secondary schools and colleges in 45 wards in Bungoma County have benefitted from Sh5.7 million National Government Affirmative Action Fund. The funds were disbursed Monday by Bungoma Woman Representative Reginalda Wanyonyi who released cheques to beneficiaries. Speaking at Buko Secondary School in Kimilili Sub-County, Ms Wanyonyi said the fund is aimed at helping students to access education. “Since I started disbursing the affirmative action funds, 631 students from different high schools and middle-level colleges have benefited after they made their applications,” she said. Dr Wanyonyi said that the fund will help the beneficiaries pursue their studies uninterrupted because majority of them would have dropped out of school due to lack of fees. DRESSMAKING She revealed that she had helped a number of married women who had approached her for assistance to join Kisiwa Technical Training Institute in Kabuchai Constituency to train in dressmaking. “The funds will help such people. If you have got a chance to train in technical skills please don’t hesitate to visit my office for assistance so that [you] can change [your] lives,” she said. Bernard Wamanga, the principal of Teremi Boys High School, where majority of the beneficiaries came from, applauded the legislator for her relentless efforts to boost education in the county. “I am challenging other politicians to emulate her efforts by helping needy students in schools and colleges so that they [do not] drop out,” he said.

Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka has defected from ODM to Ford-Kenya party. Mr Onyonka said that being in the Moses Wetang'ula-led party increases his chances of getting re-elected. He will be formerly received by Mr Wetang'ula on Sunday. "This is a step I am taking openly and I have no regrets," he told the Nation on phone on Friday. The Kitutu Chache South legislator had a brief dalliance with Jubilee Party, led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, before hitting the road back to the Orange party led by Mr Raila Odinga. He said possible nomination nightmare in ODM prompted his exit. "Politics has become increasingly dynamic and too convoluted and experience has shown that ODM nominations have never been fair."

"He did not object and equally has no problems because I am joining a party that is a member of the National Super Alliance where ODM is a member too," Mr Onyonka said. In the recent past he has had several run-ins with Kisii ODM party branch chairman Samuel Omwando. At one time, the duo openly clashed in the presence of Mr Odinga at Kisii Sports club. The MP claimed that Mr Omwando had been ferrying goons to jeer him whenever Mr Odinga was in town. Mr Onyonka will now face Mr Omwando, James Onkangi, Engineer Peter Mochoge and Andrew Maubi for the position. The constituency has more than 45,158, which will be used to define the outcome in the forthcoming polls.

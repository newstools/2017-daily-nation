A warrant of arrest issued against Kandara MP Alice Wahome has been lifted after she presented herself in court. Ms Wahome is facing charges of obstructing police officers from executing their duties and abuse of office. A Murang’a magistrate had issued the warrant of arrest last week after she failed to turn up in court. Murang’a Principal Magistrate Antony Mwicigi lifted the warrant of arrest after the lawmaker presented herself in court pleading that it be put aside. Mr Mwicigi withdrew the warrant and warned the legislator against skipping court. The MP, who did not plea, said she will appear in court whenever needed as she is not traveling outside the country anytime soon. CAMPAIGN SEASON She at the same time asked the court to be considerate as it is a campaign season but said she will be informing the court in advance if she might fail to appear in person. The MP will appear in court on April 12, 2017 for further directions. Addressing the court, the lawmaker accused the prosecution and police chiefs in Murang’a of failure to notify her of the warrant of arrest. She said she read malice in the whole matter, noting that the Murang’a County Police Commander Naomi Ichami and the Kandara OCPD had failed to contact her and inform her about the charges. ‘After the warrant of arrest was issued by this honourable court, information was all over social media platforms and the next day all the dailies published the matter,” she said. “This is being done to intimidate me but I will not be intimidated,” she added.   Alice Wahome is accused of obstructing NTSA officials during a traffic operation.

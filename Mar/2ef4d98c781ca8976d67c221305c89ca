Kenya has received equipment worth Sh32 million which can detect chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attack. The donation from the European Union (EU) will enhance the country’s capability to respond to incidents involving the threats. Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri on Tuesday received the equipment at Afya House from the EU delegation led by Mr Jean Pierre. Dr Muraguri said the donation is a demonstration of Kenya’s “good partnership with EU.” He said the equipment — which was enclosed in suitcase-like packaging — are part of other five major projects between the country and the regional body to ensure the country and the region can mitigate the risks of any biological or chemical threat. “Kenya hosts the Eastern and Central Africa secretariat for European Union’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear centre of excellence. The secretariat, that will coordinate activities among 11 countries in the continent, will be housed at Afya Annex in Nairobi,” he said. This comes barely a year, when the national security agencies announced in May last year, that they had successfully foiled a plan by a group of medical interns who were planning a biological terror attack using anthrax bacteria. The other projects by the EU include a response plan to events involving chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials. Further, the partnership has seen the training of 20 responders drawn from major response institutions. Director of the National Disaster Management Unit Mr Pius Masai was present to attest to the benefits of this facilitation. He said: “I thank the EU for their support and I urge the first responders to be committed to preparedness and response to any incidents.”   The arrest of the two, police said, had foiled terror attacks with explosives and other weapons that were planned for Nairobi and Mombasa.

Three people perished in a road accident near Nyamaiya Trading Centre along the Nyamira-Kisumu highway on Friday night. The trio died when a lorry they were travelling in lost control and overturned on a sharp bent section of the road. Nyamira OCPD Riko Ngare said the driver of the lorry which was carrying building materials lost its control after hitting several potholes in one of the bridges constructed at one of the sharp corners on the road. "It took my officers and members of the public several hours to retrieve the three bodies from the mangled lorry which overturned and hit the side of the road," Mr Ngare said. He said the fourth passenger who was travelling in the ill- fated lorry was critically injured and rushed to Nyamira Hospital. The bodies of the victims were taken to the same Nyamira Hospital mortuary.

Tuskys supermarket has launched the third cohort internship programme in western Kenya targeting 400 individuals. Dan Githua, the chief executive officer, listed the counties singled out to be Kisumu, Kisii and Kakamega. "We are looking to take on board about 400 new interns who will be stationed within our branches across Kenya and Uganda. They will get training for six months," Mr Githua said. The initiative is in partnership with the Kenya Commercial Bank Foundation and the beneficiaries will be imbibed with skills at Tuskys Training School in Nairobi; and will earn an allowance of Sh15,000 a month. Roughly 7,000 had applied to be considered for the opportunity. Since its inception in 2015, there has been 2,870 beneficiaries. Mr Githua said the purpose is to provide youths, aged between 24 and 30, with the wherewithal on customer service, product knowledge and retail business. And at the end of the teaching they will receive certificates. Principal Secretary of Trade Chris Kiptoo commended the organisers and said the government, through the Technical and Vocational Educational and Training Authority, will examine the courses being taught and develop a syllabus. "Once they approve we will then develop the curriculum. Then the certification will be provided at all levels; certificate, diploma and university, and ensure any approved institution can conduct such trainings," Dr Kiptoo said.

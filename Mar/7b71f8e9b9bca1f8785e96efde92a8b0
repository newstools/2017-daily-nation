Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario Tuesday night said the adoption of the new National Olympic Committee of Kenya constitution was a positive move towards creating accountability in sports. The minister has been in the forefront in the fight against the continued stay in office of Kenya’s beleaguered Olympics officials. “That’s a great leap towards efficiency and transparency in the management of Nock affairs,” Wario said. “I congratulate the affiliate federations for insisting on these minimum changes before embarking of the forthcoming Nock elections and the International Olympic Committee for their support. “We now urge Nock to ensure smooth, free and transparent elections that will help further transform the federation into a more inclusive and progressive body in the management of the Olympic sports.” Wario had disbanded the Nock board after its disastrous handling of the Kenyan team during the Rio Olympics. Five officials, including secretary general Francis Kinyili Paul and Olympic team leader Stephen Arap Soi, were later charged with various offences, ranging from mismanagement to stealing uniforms meant for the team. Their cases are still pending in court. The IOC assisted in the drafting of new laws following a national outcry over corruption and the treatment of the Kenyan team at last summer’s Olympics.

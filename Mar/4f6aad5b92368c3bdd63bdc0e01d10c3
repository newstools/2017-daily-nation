The Kenya Volleyball Federation league for men and women set off this week at Kamkunji grounds, Nyeri. However, the withdrawal of several teams due to financial constraints is worrying. It impacts negatively on the standards of the game and denies talented players a chance to showcase their prowess. Besides, it is an indictment of the sponsoring teams and the organisers. Among those pulling out are Nairobi Water women’s team, Bungoma men and women’s teams and Kenya Airways. Add to that the fact that most clubs have delayed to register and it becomes clear that most sponsors are struggling to invest in the sport. It is even more worrying that government departments have also found it difficult to sponsor teams to continental championships. Kenya Prisons women’s team and the General Service Unit failed to honour their continental assignments in 2015, while Kenya Prisons men’s team also failed to travel last year. This gives both club managements and volleyball federation something to ponder as far the marketing their clubs and the game are concerned.

National Super Alliance (Nasa) leadership is working on a plan to hold joint nominations for some positions around the country. The coordinating committee on Tuesday held consultations with the principals to agree on the best way of conducting joint primaries to avoid losing out seats to their opponents. MANIPULATION Areas like Nairobi and Mombasa have been identified as zones where joint nominations would be appropriate. “We met on Tuesday to discuss a number of issues. We are talking about joint nominations and how best it can be done. We are yet to agree on anything so far but talks are in progress within the committee,” said Mr James Orengo, the chairman of Nasa National Coordinating Committee. He said the team is also fine tuning plans for the nominations of Nasa's presidential candidate, which will be unveiled soon. “Work is in progress and I can say that everything is running according to the original plan,” he said. However the biggest challenge facing the coalition is how to ensure smooth joint primaries in Nairobi and Mombasa. Already some candidates in Mombasa have opposed plans for joint nominations fearing manipulations within the coalition. The committee has proposed that nominations for all seats in Nairobi and Mombasa be subjected to joint party primaries. COMPETITION In the last elections, the defunct Cord coalition lost seats in Nairobi due to internal competition giving a chance rival parties to outwit them. The coalition is also working on the formation of a joint National Elections Board that will be in charge of party primaries. On Wednesday, Starehe MP Maina Kamanda said Jubilee is working to ensure a landslide victory in Nairobi. He told the Nation that JP is concerned about the state of the city and that it is strategising to ensure a clean sweep in Nairobi.   According to Raila Odinga, opposition leaders will implement ballot protection system.

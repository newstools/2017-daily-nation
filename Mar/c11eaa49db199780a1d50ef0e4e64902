Jane Wacu’s highly discussed transfer to Kenya Pipeline isn’t a done deal as yet, Saturday Nation Sport can exclusively reveal, even though the Kenya international concedes she wouldn’t “think twice” if an opportunity to link up with the Kenya Volleyball Federation women league champions comes her way. Kenya Pipeline’s Communications manager Jason Nyantino on Friday confirmed the continental bigwigs are courting the highly rated setter, who besides featuring for cross town rivals Kenya Prisons, recently enjoyed a two year professional stint with French top flight club Chamalieres. “She is one player who will no doubt help us with our target of winning the continental title this year. We are also looking at her as a replacement for Janet Wanja, who has asked to retire at the end of this season. We are also keen to follow all the rules in acquiring her services,” said Nyantino. Wacu’s club Kenya Prisons has however denied knowledge of the impending transfer. “There has been no approach for the player although I am told the Pipeline people have been after her since last year’s play-offs. If Pipeline want her, they have to come out in the open and talk to us,” said David Kilundo, the Assistant Commissioner of Prisons, who doubles up as the team manager. Kenya Volleyball Federation’s organizing secretary Ishamel Chege, whose chief role is running the top flight league also denied being in the know.   Wacu was handed a lucrative three-year deal on Thursday morning that included a sweetened pay package, a more comprehensive medical cover as well as housing allowance.

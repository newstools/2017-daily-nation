Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale has dismissed an opinion poll rating ODM leader Raila Odinga as the best bet to fly National Super Alliance (Nasa) flag. Dr Khalwale has maintained that the Nasa coordinating committee will not be influenced by findings of opinion polls in the search for a flagbearer. He spoke on Saturday evening in a phone interview after the release of Infotrak survey indicating the former Premier enjoyed a 68.3 per cent rating to emerge as the most preferred Nasa flagbearer for the August 8 polls. The Coordinating Committee, he said, was on track in its work to ensure the Nasa flagbearer would was the best suited candidate to clinch victory for the opposition. Dr Khalwale is a members of the 12-member committee picked by Nasa to identify its flagbearer and running mate. “We are aware that although aspects of the poll results are quite exciting…sometimes they can be used to manipulate the outcomes,” said the Ford Kenya deputy leader. Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka came second at 13,1 per cent while his Amani National Congress counterpart Musalia Mudavadi got a 12.3 per cent rating. Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula garnered 2.2 per cent support in the survey released on Saturday. Dr Khalwale said it was interesting that the ongoing process by Nasa to pick its flagbearer had captured the imagination of Jubilee supporters as indicated in the survey. According to the poll, 27.3 per cent of Jubilee supporters said Mr Mudavadi stood the best chance of defeating President Uhuru Kenyatta while 26.5 per cent said Mr Odinga would clinch victory if he ran for presidency. Mr Kalonzo had a 24.6 per cent rating against President Kenyatta while Mr Wetang'ula got a 3.9 per cent.   Senator Wetang’ula said the party will field candidates in all elective seats.

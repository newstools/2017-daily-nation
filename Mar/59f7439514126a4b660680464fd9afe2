The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) officers raided the offices of the Homa Bay County Assembly Clerk and Principal Accountant over alleged embezzlement of funds. The clerk Mr Bob Kephers and accountant Mr Maurice Amek, are suspected to have embezzled millions of shillings from the county government. Mr Kephers fled soon after the anti-graft officers arrived on Wednesday, while Mr Amek was detained as the EACC officers searched two of his houses in different estates in Homa Bay town. The EACC South Nyanza Regional officer Mr Abraham Kemboi said Mr Amek is alleged to have acquired property worth over Sh50 million. The county assembly clerk is also said to have recently acquired property valued at Sh30 million for which he paid in cash. MONEY RECOVERED "Even if the clerk were to acquire a loan from a bank, it would not cover the amounts used to purchase all the property he has accumulated including the latest (one) that is approximated at Sh30 million which he paid in cash," said Mr Kemboi. During the raid, EACC officials recovered electronic items, documents and unknown amount of money. "We are conducting searches on some of the county government offices because we have evidence of embezzlement of funds running to millions of shillings by the clerk and the county principal accountant," said Mr Kemboi. Mr Kemboi said some county assembly officers will be summoned by the anti-graft commission to record their statements once the documents are analysed. The EACC officer said they will also conduct searches at the officers' rural residences in Kisumu and Homa Bay towns. The anti-graft officers have launched a manhunt for the county clerk who has since gone into hiding.

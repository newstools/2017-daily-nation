Justice delayed, as the adage goes, is justice denied. This is a situation that is all too familiar in our law courts. Some civil and even criminal matters take too long to conclude. In some instances, litigants have waited for decisions that could have made a difference in their lives and which never came, because they did not live long enough for the snailâ€™s pace of the judicial system to provide its verdict. In civil matters, businesses and individuals have suffered losses that could have been avoided had their petitions been speedily determined. In criminal cases, some suspects have waited in remand or even on death row for years, for their innocence to be determined after inordinately long periods of suffering. This is the worst one can do to an innocent person, but again it is important that once accused they go through due process. Chief Justice David Maraga has pledged to prioritise the reduction of the huge backlog of cases that undermines the delivery of justice. This is why the Judiciary has hired 73 mediators to help dispose of more than 500,000 cases pending in various courts. As an alternative to the long-drawn-out process, the mediators encourage alternative modes of solving disputes. A group based in Nairobi has determined 27 cases involving Sh500 million in the commercial division and 55 in the family section. This should be extended to other areas.

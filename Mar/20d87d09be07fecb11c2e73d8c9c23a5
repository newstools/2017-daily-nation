A scuffle ensued on Thursday at Milimani Law Courts between a magistrate and a prosecutor over a file of a jailed State prosecutor. This was after High Court Judge Ngenye Macharia requested for the file in which Milimani Law Courts resident magistrate Tobiko Sinkiyian sent Willy Momanyi to jail on Wednesday for failing to produce witnesses in a Sh11 million theft case involving a former national council of Non-Governmental Organisations CEO Philip Okeyo. Mr Momanyi was also fined Sh25,000. The Magistrate had also ordered another prosecutor to terminate the case that has dragged on for six years. However, Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko has applied for the review of the case at the High Court. Meanwhile, the High Court has also ordered Senior Counsel Paul Muite not to defend former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga in a robbery with violence case. Mr Muite has also been barred from being called as a State witness against Mr Njenga even after having record his statement earlier. The case against Mr Njenga and others will, however, proceed, ruled the court.   The magistrate says the case has been pending before court for six years.

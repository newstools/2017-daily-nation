It is unfortunate that the work stoppage by lecturers has gone largely unnoticed, having been upstaged in the headlines by the doctors’ strike which is now in its third month. Some might say this is a sign of how little value is attached to the question of university education in Kenya. This is an unfortunate situation because no society can move from one level of development to another without stepped-up investment in its tertiary education. Particularly for countries not especially endowed with stores of natural resources such as oil and other minerals, developing a competitive and well trained human resource cadre is the only sure way to create an economy that lifts the greatest number out of poverty. Universities have a central role in this task. The strike by the lecturers affects multiple players. Thousands of students have gone for weeks without tuition. The Education ministry has ordered a halt to payment of the lecturers’ salaries. And parents will certainly feel the pinch because they had already paid fees and coughed up for expensive hostel facilities. It is time for both sides – that of university leadership and the Ministry of Education as well as that of the Universities Staff Academic Union and Kenya University Staff Union – to work earnestly towards arriving at a compromise that allows learning to resume. The lecturers’ strike may not grab the headlines, but this is a sector that demands the utmost attention.

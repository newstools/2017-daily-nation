The late Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Snr had been complaining of fatigue and had lost weight before he died, a witness has told a Machakos court. Ms Stellar Mwendwa, who had worked as a Personal Secretary for Mr Kilonzo for ten years, on Tuesday told a Machakos court that said her boss had complained on several occasion of feeling tired. CAMPAIGN “There had been a lot of work and he had been complaining for so long,” Ms Mwendwa said. “He had lost a bit of weight which I attributed to the campaign work, especially coming from the electioneering period.” State Prosecutor Joseph Gikonyo who was cross-examining Ms Mwendwa asked how Mr Kilonzo related with his workers. She answered that her late boss was “strict” but they had a cordial working relationship. INQUEST Ms Mwendwa was the fourth witness to testify in the ongoing inquest into the death of Mr Kilonzo. A doctor who was scheduled to testify on Monday did not turn up. The hearing continues on June 27. There was little public interest in the case as only a handful of people sat in the court to listen to the proceedings presided over by Resident Magistrate Kipkurui Kibellion. The late Senator Mutula who, was also a senior counsel for many years, died in mysterious circumstances at his Kwa Kwelu Ranch in Machakos on April 27, 2013.   The country was Saturday thrust into mourning following the sudden death of Makueni Senator and former Cabinet minister Mutula Kilonzo at his ranch in Maanzoni, Machakos County.

Kenya is in the process of hiring 500 doctors from Tanzania to help address shortage of health workers and also mitigate effects of the just ended strike. In a press statement released by the Tanzanian government Saturday, the decision was made after senior Ministry of Health officials from Kenya led by Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu held talks with President John Magufuli. President Magufuli said his government accepted Kenya's request for Tanzanian doctors due to the cordial relationship between the two countries. Following the deal, Tanzania invited doctors to apply for the positions. Successful applicants will get a two year contract. Last year, a study by healthcare planners in Tanzania revealed that the country is producing more medical doctors than it can absorb in its hospitals. Over 60 per cent of medical graduates who were trained in Tanzania and abroad were not recruited to cover the shortage of doctors in most State-run health facilities. The researchers analysed data showing the output of medical graduates in Tanzania over ten years, warning that the government needed to address the matter urgently. According to the findings, only 14 per cent of those who were not employed by the government managed to find full-time jobs in private hospitals. But the rest, according to the lead researcher, Dr Nathanel Sirili, cannot be accounted for.

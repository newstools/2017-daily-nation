The national government has been urged to start feeding programmes in primary schools to avert incidences of pupils eating poisonous wild fruits because of hunger. Kenya National Union of Teachers’ Tharaka-Nithi County branch secretary-general Njeru Mutani said Friday learning had been affected in areas stricken by hunger in the county. He said the 47 pupils from Mutuguni Primary School who were hospitalised at Consolata Cottage Hospital in Chuka town on Wednesday for poisoning after eating poisonous wild seeds were hungry. “Government should immediately start feeding program in primary schools to avoid incidences of pupils eating poisonous wild fruits and seeds,” said Mr Mutani. He noted that school dropout had increased especially in the drier areas of Tharaka and Igambang’ombe as pupils help their parents to look for food and water. The official asked President Kenyatta to ensure that locals are given relief food as he promised during his tour in the county in January.   Pupils complained of stomach ache, diarrhoea, vomiting and dizziness.

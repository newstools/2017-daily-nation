A couple died after being electrocuted in Kebere, Kisii County. The man, 42, identified as Jared Moseti is said to have touched a naked electric wire as he awoke at dawn. His wife died after trying to pull him away. Family members said the couple had requested to be connected to electricity by tapping their neighbour's line. "It happened that the connection was successful but a live wire touched a clothing line that killed the couple," Abel Nyagaka, Jared's brother, said. Ogembo OCPD Richard Muguai confirmed the incident. The bodies have been taken to Tabaka Mission Hospital mortuary.

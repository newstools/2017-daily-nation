A plan to recruit 500 doctors from Tanzania to ease a shortage in the public hospitals raises fundamental questions about the objective. On paper, it looks like a plausible proposition, but in reality, it appears to hide the real intentions. Available data indicate that there are some 1,400 jobless doctors, who, ideally, deserve to be given the first preference in hiring. Though Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopas Mailu reckons that they are jobless by choice after resigning from the public service, which is debatable, why shouldn’t the government first put out an advertisement calling for unemployed medics to fill the vacancies? With the improved terms for doctors following the end of a three-month strike, it shouldn’t be difficult to attract more. It beats logic to import labour, given the difficulties it would present, including quality and competence questions and acceptance by locals. The Medical Association of Tanzania is also critical of the plan, citing an unimplemented salary agreement with their own government. Health experts have also questioned if Tanzania is truly capable of exporting doctors to other countries given its population and high demand. While we appreciate efforts to plug shortages in the public health sector and improve service delivery, officials should critically review the position that the only way to do this is by bringing in Tanzanian doctors.

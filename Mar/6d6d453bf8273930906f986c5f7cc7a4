President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent top government and Jubilee officials to ODM leader Raila Odinga’s Nyanza backyard to fight claims that he had abandoned the region and wage his re-election campaign. The officials indicated that the government is putting in place mechanisms to address the region’s fishing, transport and entertainment. The delegation arrived in Kisumu on Thursday morning under the leadership of newly appointed Jubilee Party secretary-general Raphael Tuju. ODM chairman John Mbadi and Kisumu deputy governor Ruth Odinga have claimed the President has no projects in Nyanza and accused him of neglecting the region. Speaking in Kisumu, Mr Tuju said: “President Kenyatta is perturbed by reports in the media with respect to the irony that the fish business is poor due to imports from China which is an economic tragedy.” With Mr Tuju is Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario and his ICT counterpart Joe Mucheru who launched a recording studio on Friday. Others are Sports PS Robert Okudo, Youth and Public Service PS Lillian Omollo and Youth Enterprise Development fund board chairman Ronnie Osumba. They will visit Bondo, Rarieda and Homa Bay. Ms Omollo pointed out that the largest National Youth Service group is in Kisumu where 5,000 youth are earning a daily wage of Sh331 and making daily savings of Sh141 every day for the last one year. “We have saved about Sh80 million in the Saccos in the area,” she said. Mr Wario said they supported the Boyieta Wuod Awasi band whose nine members perished in a boat accident. Mr Mucheru said the Lake Basin is a top ICT county and he will ensure the government contributes in fibre and constituency innovation hubs.

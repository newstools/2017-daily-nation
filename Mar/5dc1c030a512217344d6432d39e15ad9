President Uhuru Kenyatta has raided the office of Nairobi Governor and offered Evans Kidero’s embattled director of communications Walter Mong’are a top Jubilee job. It is said Mr Mong’are could be appointed as the Kisii County Jubilee youth point man. Mr Monga’re, has had a bitter-sweet relationship with Dr Kidero. In May last year, he was suspended in unclear circumstances with reports claiming he had issues with his academic papers. But Mr Mong’are had claimed that the suspension was malicious and out of witch hunt from some people at City Hall. He was reinstated three months later. However, he is yet to officially resign as Dr Kidero’s communications director, only saying he will, later this week, have talks with the ODM leader “to streamline my transition.” He was however quick to note that he was not ‘defecting’ to Jubilee since he was not seeking an elective seat. “I will be meeting with the Governor and discuss…he is a friend to the President and I am sure we will agree. “When God opens opportunities no amount of anger, hatred can stop me. I am being recognised as a public servant by the President and it does not mean it’s political,” said Mr Mong’are. He added: “It's not every day that the President asks for someone to work with him, and so it's an honour and privilege to serve the President in whatever capacity.” Mr Monga’re, who is also popularly known as Nyambane, shrugged off a notion that he was a Jubilee mole at City Hall and in Raila Odinga’s ODM party. At the moment, he is on official duty in Kisumu where he is organising the Lake Region Economic Bloc inaugural international health investment 2017.

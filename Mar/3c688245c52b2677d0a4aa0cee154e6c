Kenya s Cross country and relays team on Sunday evening took time off their busy training regime to tour various places in Embu County.The 30-member squad traversed the breadth of the county, sampling the picturesque environment before taking a game drive at Mwea National Reserve in Makima, Mbeere South.The buoyant team, led by team manager Evans Bosire, head coach Juma Ndiwa, team captain Patrick Komon and his deputy Faith Chepng etich, also used the session to bond as a team, putting aside the challenges of the training. The trip also revealed another side of the team comprising of 12 junior, 12 senior and six relay runners as they chatted away excitedly and laughed after seeing Grant s zebras, giraffes, elephants, lesser kudus and other animals at Mwea National Reserve.The usually reserved athletes brought out their livelier side, speaking in a jovial manner and even taking photos of the animals.Earlier on, several members of the team had attended Sunday church service together with students of Kigari Teachers Training College. Bosire said the team had a bus from the college at their disposal on a full-time basis and the squad will not have to walk for long distances, unless it was part of the training programme.He said the team was optimistic of posting good results in Uganda, saying the main team rivals were Kenyans themselves referring to athletes who have switched nationalities. We are aware of the many defectors whom we will face. We are well prepared to face them since we are the original Team Kenya, said Bosire. He hailed the introduction of relay to the event, saying it would help ensure those engaged in middle distance races also participate. email print email print Assistant team manager insists athletes must employ team work to deliver emphatic victory in Kampala on March 26 Kidney and cancer patients might have been the most affected by the doctors action.

Former Mungiki Leader Maina Njenga on Wednesday defected to Kanu, two weeks after the Jubilee Party rejected his nomination papers. Mr Njenga, who is seeking to replace Mr G.G. Kariuki as the senator for Laikipia, was received by Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi and Secretary-General Nick Salat at the party headquarters in Kilimani, Nairobi. While receiving Mr Njenga, four parliamentary aspirants and 10 aspiring MCAs, Mr Moi said the party was open to any other person who feels oppressed by the parties they are in currently. The former Mungiki leader said he was frustrated by the Jubilee Party, which he said rejected him without even looking at his papers. “They (Jubilee) told me they were waiting for someone to give a go-ahead. I am glad I have found a party that is willing to accommodate me,” he said, adding that Kanu belongs to everyone. Mr Njenga, however, reiterated his support for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s re-election in the August 8 General Election. His decamping came as Jubilee lost its bid to lock him out from contesting on a Jubilee ticket, meaning the party is required by court to accept his nomination papers. This is after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal on Wednesday issued an order requiring the party to “accept his nomination documents unconditionally” as per Mr Njenga’s request. Mr Njenga has sued the Jubilee Party and the IEBC for rejecting his nomination papers yet he had paid Sh250,000 as requisite fees among other huge sum of monies for Jubilee campaigns. In defence, Jubilee told the tribunal that it acknowledged Mr Njenga is a member of the party, but said that it does not guarantee him being allowed to vie for a political seat. The order was issued by tribunal members Kyalo Mbobu, James Atema, Adelide Mbithi, Milly Odongo and Paul Ngotho.

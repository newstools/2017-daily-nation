LAUSANNE Fifa's former World Cup evaluation chief Harold Mayne-Nicholls on Thursday appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) against his three-year ban by football's world governing body. The Chilean was suspended from all football-related activities in July 2015 after being found guilty by Fifa's ethics committee of "asking for personal favours". Mayne-Nicholls, a former Chilean football federation president, was in charge of evaluating the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. He wrote the report that gave Qatar the worst ranking of the candidates for the 2022 World Cup finals which the wealthy Gulf state went on to win.Mayne-Nicholls notably asked for favours from Qatar for members of his family. He was originally suspended for seven years in July 2015 but had his ban reduced to three years last April.

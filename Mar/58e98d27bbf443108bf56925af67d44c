A man is nursing serious wounds at a Voi hospital after his cousin allegedly poured acid on his face due to wrangles over inheritance. Kelvin Wachira, 30, also lost his eyesight after the attack and is being treated at St Joseph’s Shelter of Hope hospital. Speaking in the medical facility, Mr Wachira said his cousin and some of his family members were unhappy with a resolution made to make him the caretaker of his grandfather’s property. He said efforts to resolve the matter resulted in the alleged attack. “I had gone to my cousin’s house to solve the misunderstanding between us. Unfortunately, he splashed acid on me,” he said. He said after the death of his father and grandfather, the family gave him the authority of looking after the property. He said his mother and siblings were against the decision but eventually agreed to it after persuasion from his aunts and uncles. His sister, Linet Mukami, said they were fearing for his brother’s life as the attacker had not been arrested. Voi Officer Commanding Police Division Joseph Chesire said his team had launched investigations into the attack. He, however, said the suspect will be arrested after they receive a P3 form from the doctor who treated Mr Wachira. “We will then know what charges to press,” Mr Chesire said.

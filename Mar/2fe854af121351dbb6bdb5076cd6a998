Nakuru gubernatorial aspirant John Mututho has suffered a major political blow after his preferred running mate Maureen Chebet opted out of his camp. In a shocking announcement on Sunday afternoon Ms Chebet, 26, vowed to support the incumbent Kinuthia Mbugua’s re-election bid, in a move likely to change the political equation in the cosmopolitan town. While announcing the move, the first time politician cited several shortcomings, including her former boss deeming the running mate as having hailed from outside the County. Ms Chebet an orphan was born and raised in Kuresoi, Nakuru County. “My former boss further openly downplayed the significance of my region’s voting bloc and I felt slighted,” said Ms Chebet a secondary school teacher. She claimed that Mututho said he did not need votes from Kuresoi, where she comes from, in order for him to win the gubernatorial race. “Mututho chose me because he wanted a young person as a running mate, but I feel he has been using me as a rubber stamp in his campaign,” she said. Flanked by her supporters, Ms Chebet disclosed that she will not be vying for any political seat, but will vigorously campaign for Mr Mbugua to secure a second term in office. The decision by Ms Chebet will send Mr Mututho, who unveiled her as running mate two months ago, back to the drawing board. Mr Mututho became the first contender for the seat to unveil his running mate. He said Ms Chebet would help him consolidate the women and youth votes as well as help handle key issues touching on the youth, who form a high percentage of the Nakuru population.   Former Nacada chairman says Ms Chebet would help him connect to a key constituency.

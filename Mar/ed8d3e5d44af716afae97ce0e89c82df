After 100 days of deaths, pain and despair, the doctors’ strike has ended. The Health ministry, the Council of Governors and the medics' union signed a joint return-to-work formula, effectively bringing to an end the protracted industrial action that has cost many lives. GOOD NEWS The deal, which is good news to Kenyans, especially patients from poor backgrounds, was inked shortly after 6pm at Delta House, in Nairobi. Council of Governors Chairman Peter Munya and officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union annouced an end to the strike after putting ink to paper. KMPDU Secretary-General Ouma Oluga said the medics had agreed to end their job boycott. PAINFUL "This has been a painful issue for the country," he said. The three parties said they would wrap-up deliberations on the medics' Collective Bargaining Agreement and deposit it in court. The signing delayed after the medics' raised issues with the documents. The governors, Health CS Cleopa Mailu, doctors and the clergy who have been mediating in the standoff held a closed-door meeting to iron out certain issues. WALKED OUT Mr Munya and other governors had prepared to issue a press statement on their final decision on the doctors’ strike by 4.30pm. However, officials of the KMPDU walked into the room and said they had not seen the documents county bosses had signed. After an hour's wait, they emerged from the meeting and put pen to paper.   Medics, Health ministry and governors tell court they will file return-to-work formula and consent today.

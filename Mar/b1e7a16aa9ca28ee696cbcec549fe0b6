The pair of professional Alexander Wennstam of Sweden and local amateur Anthony Ngera beat three other pairs with a brilliant score of 45 points, to clinch the first Barclays Kenya Open Pro-Am tournament played in Stableford format for the first time at the par-71 Muthaiga Golf Club course Tuesday. The winning pair birdied four holes at the front nine for 21 points which they followed with 24 at the back nine where they birdied three holes and eagled one for the total score. In second place with a combination of 21 and 24 was the team of Spain’s Scot Fernandez and Moses Matsiko who started with a bogey and a double bogey at the first and second holes, but made an improvement there after, picking up a birdie at the fourth and at the 10th, 16th and 18th to settle for the second prize, pushing the pair of Zimbabwe’s Mark Williams and Vet Lab’s Tom Macakiage who beat the team of former Kenya Open champion Jake Roos and Sam Kairu on countback.       Six other teams tied on 44 points. Each of the four top pros won Sh19,950 (450 Euros). The second Pro-Am sponsored by Barclays Bank is set for 7am Wednesday. Kenyan professionals and amateurs playing in this year’s Open were boosted by Sports Kenya’s Sh2 million sponsorship to cover their expenses in the championship. “Like other Kenyan sports teams, our golfers are here to represent the country and it is our responsibility to ensure they are supported,” Sports Kenya chairman Fred Muteti said while making the donation.   Players all set to tackle the par-71 course in the 2017 Barclays Kenya Open.

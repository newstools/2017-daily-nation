The production of galvanised iron roofing sheets slowed down in the first 10 months of last year amid a slackening off in construction. Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows that the production of galvanised iron sheets stood at 209,400 tonnes compared with 214,200 tonnes in 2015. Developers say the decline in production mirrors a decline in demand that has been caused by the use of alternative roofing material and construction of flat-topped buildings. Edelweiss Realtors consultant Lucy Githire says  that, more private housing developers are  adopting new technology such as solar tiles  leading to reduced  sales of galvanised iron sheets.

A man suspected of raping and later placing a woman on a railway line to be run over by a train was on Monday charged with attempted murder. Steven Otieno Okalo was also charged with gang rape and committing an indecent act contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. The accused, who appeared before Mombasa senior resident magistrate Edgar Kagoni, denied the charge and was remanded in custody. Prosecutor Lillian Fundi had objected to the accused being released on bond saying he does not have a known residence and hence it would be difficult to trace him to attend court for the hearing of the case. Ms Fundi further told the court that the accused is a flight risk and had been arrested by police through help from members of the public. “The accused is facing very serious charges which attract heavy sentences if convicted hence a possibility that he may abscond and leave the jurisdiction of the court,” said the prosecutor. The accused, allegedly, jointly with another not before court, attempted to unlawfully cause the death of a woman by placing her on the railway line. According to the prosecution, the accused with his accomplice gang-raped the woman. The offences are alleged to have been committed on February 3 in Kibarani, Mombasa County. The case was fixed for a pre-trial hearing on April 11.

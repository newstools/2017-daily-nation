Former AFC Leopards defender Edwin Wafula then gave Nzoia the lead before the break before Shafik Batambuze struck the equaliser for brewers with a well taken free-kick just two minutes after the break. Brian Otieno's brace and a contested Boniface Omondi strike straight from a corner completed the rout.

Batambuze then restored parity after the breather only for Otieno to hit a quick-fire brace from two set pieces in the 51st and 66th minutes to put the score beyond the napping brewers.Tusker's shambolic defending was exposed with the pacy Nzoia forwards enjoying a bright afternoon in Nakuru. email print email print Tusker winger Noah Wafula scored the first goal of the 2017 SportPesa Premier League season.

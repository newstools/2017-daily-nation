The Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA)  has sued five of its customers for using forged title deeds to secure loans amounting to Sh450 million. The bank says in a complaint to the police that the same pieces of land were slated for auction by another bank in February last year, raising suspicion as to the legitimacy of their title deeds. Detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) have been investigating the matter since then. Details of the probe have been revealed in a suit the five customers — Patrick Kang’ethe Njuguna, Edward Njuguna Kang’ethe, George James Kang’ethe, Margaret Wambui Kang’ethe and Gladys Njeri Kang’ethe — have filed seeking to stop their arrest for fraud. The five used their firms, Ndonga Ltd, Wardpa Holdings and Kinjunje Garden Ltd to secure the loans. CBA, in its letter to the DCI, says it got suspicious of the title deeds after seeing an advertisement by Diamond Trust Bank seeking to auction the same assets for a defaulted loan.

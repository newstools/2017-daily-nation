At least four people, among them a pedestrian, have died following a crash involving two private cars in Jogoo, along Kisii-Nyamira road early Saturday. One passenger died on the spot while two others and a pedestrian died at the Christamarianne Mission Hospital while undergoing treatment. A witness told the Nation.co.ke that a Probox car heading to Kisii town hit a pothole before it swerved and hit an oncoming Subaru car. The Toyota Probox was carrying 13 passengers and was in high speed, according to witnesses. Among the dead is a security officer who was on his way to work to relieve a night duty colleague. No one was injured in the Subaru car during the dawn accident. Kisii County Commander Agnes Mudambi said 10 people were to hospital for treatment. Doctors at the hospital said many of the patients sustained chest and head pains.

Environment Cabinet Secretary Judi Wakhungu’s plastic bags ban will go down as a key plank of her legacy. The CS has ordered that polythene bags popularly used by shoppers must be done away with by August 28. By that time, she will probably no longer be in office, following the changes expected after the elections early that month. But it is a decision that will be treasured in the efforts to eliminate a perennial menace. Indeed, the ban is long overdue. This is something the country has grappled with for a long time, knowing the adverse environmental consequences of the poor disposal of this non-biogradable material. Plastics are an eyesore. They clog drains, contributing to the flooding that is so common in Nairobi and other towns. It costs money and effort to clear the drainage so that surface water can flow freely. Outlawing of plastics is, of course, not everybody’s cup of tea. The manufacturers stand to lose their investments. But it is a sacrifice even they must make for a cleaner environment. In fact, they should be seeking concessions from the authorities on a changeover to alternatives. A precedent has been set in East Africa by Rwanda, which has for several years now been without these plastics. There is no reason Kenya cannot and it is not for lack of alternatives. There is sisal, cloth and paper to turn into bags.

In a major breakthrough, a ring of cybercriminals who have been causing the Kenya Revenue Authority, banks, parastatals and a supermarket chain sleepless nights has been broken. These “smart” thieves have helped themselves to hundreds of millions of shillings, but their lucrative run finally ended early this week. As we say kudos to the anti-cybercrime officers for outing the criminals, their ability to penetrate systems and ferret out money should alarm all. But most importantly, it is a wake-up call to all the institutions to up their game against these crooks. The reality is that high-tech criminals will not just give up because their accomplices have been arrested. The way to stop them is to extra alter and step up surveillance to detect the schemes before they are executed. The businesses that have been hit by heavy losses must have by now learnt that greater investment in more sophisticated monitoring systems is something they must take seriously. However, the mere fact that many of the hackers are young, tech-savvy fellows indicates that they have skills that could be put to better use. The high unemployment rate that sees youth with skills, knowledge and expertise idle, is what drives some into crime. While the culprits once caught must pay for their sins, gainful engagement of likely recruits for the hackers is vital.

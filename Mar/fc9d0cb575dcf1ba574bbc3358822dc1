A man who beheaded his uncle on Valentine’s Day three years ago following a family row on Tuesday caused a stir in court when he obstructed his sentencing. He demanded that the court reviews its verdict and then re-evaluate his defence. Edward Kago who was convicted by Lady Justice Jessie Lessit on March 8, had been remanded in custody until Tuesday for sentencing told the judge: “I have nothing to say in mitigation but I demand that my defence be reviewed before any sentence can be imposed on me.” The court asked him whether he wanted to re-open his trial afresh but he insisted that the court re-evaluates his testimony in defence. Kago refused openly to be represented by the initial lawyer appointed by the deputy registrar of the high court and requested the judge to direct that he be allocated another lawyer. Lawyer Joseph Wakaba was appointed to represent the accused in the case which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction. He was picked when the accused was charged for the first time in March 2014. “I urge my Lord, to appoint me a new advocate to defend me. Also kindly review my defence,” he said. He beheaded Mr Peter Kamau Waithiru on February 14, 2014. Analysing the testimony while reading the judgement, Justice Lessit said the accused’s daughter witnessed how he killed his uncle after a family row. “Mr Kago picked a panga then slashed off the head of the deceased while his daughter watched in broad day light,” the judge said. “Neighbours dashed to the scene and found the headless and lifeless body of Peter Kamau Waithiru,” the judge stated. The judge directed that some Sh19,000 which had been confiscated from the accused be given back to the family of the deceased. The judge directed the convict remains in prison custody until March 22 for fresh directions to be given although she informed him “the case has been concluded.”

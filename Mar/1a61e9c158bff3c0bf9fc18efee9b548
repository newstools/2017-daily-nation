Six foreign based players on Monday joined Harambee Stars residential training in Machakos ahead of this week’s international friendlies against Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. Johanna Omollo, Michael Olunga, David Owino, Aboud Omar, Anthony Akumu and Jesse Were joined the legion of local based players who had begun training on Sunday. Eric Ouma and Ayub Timbe are yet to commit to this week’s duty due to “personal commitments” and are likely to miss both matches, but captain Victor Wanyama and his assistant Brian Mandela are expected to link up with the rest of the squad on Tuesday. The national team has been eliminated from the ongoing 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifiers, and they will honor the Fifa international week with a match against Uganda on Thursday at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos and another against DRC this Sunday at the same venue. Coach Stanley Okumbi hopes to use the two friendly matches to foster cohesion and preparedness among his players ahead of the qualifiers for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers that begin in June this year.

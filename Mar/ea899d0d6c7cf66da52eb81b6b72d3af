In Kajiado, we not only have a group of morans going through some life skills and entrepreneurship, we have been teaching them environment issues and how to safe guard wildlife, Ogutu said. We are teaching children at the coastline on how to protect the endangered wildlife species. The response is enormous. Ogutu said there will be a self-catering campsite for those who will be seeking accommodation at Lewa and booking information is on the entry forms. Lewa Conservancy chief executive officer Mike Watson said the initiative has continued to transform lives and the impact has been much higher than expected. From fewer wildlife being lost to poaching, to communities understanding the value of wildlife and actively participating in its protection, we are today enjoying the fruit of what began as a small idea around a campfire in 1999, he said.Watson noted that no rhino has been lost at Lewa Conversancy in the last three years, which is part of the over eight endangered, threatened and vulnerable species that are protected.During the launch, Josephine Ekiru from Northern Rangelands Trust gave an inspiring account of how their partnership with Safaricom and Lewa Conservancy has helped transform the lives of warriors who were engaged in castle rustling and poaching among other bad activities in Northern Kenya. email print email print Antonio Guterres is pushing for a new strategy to end South Sudan&#039;s war.Month-on-month inflation rate in February stood at 9.04 per cent the highest rate in four years,

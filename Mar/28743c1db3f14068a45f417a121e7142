Homeboyz touched down six tries to plummet hosts Nakuru 44-14 and open up a three-point lead heading into the final round of Kenya Cup regular season this Saturday.The Menengai Cream sponsored Deejays will be seeking a fairytale end to the regular season campaign and an automatic semi-final place when they host Nondescripts on Saturday.The Deejays, handled by former Kenya Sevens deputy coach Paul Murunga, stretched their lead to 64 points, having not conceded since round six where they stunningly lost to Strathmore Leos 32-33.In essence, their eighth successive victory in Nakuru brought their tally to 12 wins and three losses.Is this Homeboyz s year, having along the way claimed major scalps in champions Kabras Sugar, KCB, Mwamba, Impala and Quins?The semi-finals will be a different game ball altogether for the Deejays, who lost in the top six play-off to KCB during the 2015/2016 seasons besides finishing eighth in 2014/2015. Homeboyz were firm in their executions for their second victory at the home of the Great Rift side with tries from Michael Wanjala, Steve Otieno, Cyprian Kuto, Jeff Oluoch, Keith Wasike and Stanley Isogon.Kelvin Masai made two conversions and a penalty while, Wanjala one conversion and a drop goal. Tony Onyango too made a conversion.Based on their current form, Homeboyz shouldn t find it difficult disposing off Nondies, who ended their losing streak in six matches with a 39-12 victory against Mean Machine last weekend.The only other two sides vying for an automatic place in the semi-finals are second and third placed Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) and Kenya Harlequin, who are separated by one point, on 61 and 60 points respectively.Resolution Impala and Kabras Sugar, who are placed fourth and fifth with 53 and 51 points respectively are assured of a top six place play-off.However, the battle for the last place in the top six play-offs will go down to the wire between Mwamba and Nakuru, who are sixth and seventh with 46 and 43 points.KCB, who recovered from a previous 24-27 defeat by Resolution Impala to stun Quins 29-26 on Saturday, host Mwamba in their last match.A bonus point victory for the bankers will see them seal the victory so as to claim an automatic semi-final place, while Mwamba just need a win to reach the top six play-off.On the other hand, Quins must beat Strathmore Leos by a bonus point victory while hoping that Mwamba do them a favour against KCB for them to get the automatic place in the semis.Nakuru must beat Mean Machine by a bonus point, hoping that Mwamba loses to KCB for them to reach the play-offs.With Machine relegated, it will be a battle between Blak Blad and Western Bull to avoid relegation from the 12-team leading. Blak Blad secured an inspiring 22-14 victory against Western Bulls to see them climb one place to 10th with 16 points as the Bulls dropped one place to 11th with 14 points. email print email print Homeboyz upheld their league s lead.

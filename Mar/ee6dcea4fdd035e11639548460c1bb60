Anti-corruption detectives in Mombasa are hunting for a police officer who was caught red-handed soliciting a bribe. The officer attached to the Kisauni Dog Unit is reported to have swallowed the Sh2,000 bribe after the EACC officers caught him. DOG SECTION EACC boss George Ojowi said the officer, who is yet to return to his work station, was caught taking money from a tuk tuk driver in Kongowea Wednesday evening. “He took off with the money and swallowed it to hide the evidence, but we are following up with his seniors and we will catch up with him,” he said. “Officers from the dog section are not entitled to traffic work and we will want to know why he was on the road taking bribe.” Mr Ojowi said the officer’s phone has been switched off and his seniors cannot trace him either. BRIBES “My team is back at the station and is collecting more information which will help in tracing him and bringing him to book,” he said. He said they had stepped up efforts to arrest corrupt officers who demand money on the roads. “Business will not be as usual. We have officers all over the county and we got the supports of the police commanders in the county,” added Mr Ojowi.   Anti-graft agency says they received thousands of shillings from drivers in Nairobi and Murang'a

Online e-commerce platform Jumia has unveiled a programme that will see local manufacturers leverage on the firm’s network and penetration to grow sales and consumption of their products. The partnership between the e-commerce platform and local manufacturers -- including Chandaria Industries, Alladin World of Brands, Bantu Shoe, Tropical Heat, Bata and Darling Hair -- will see the traders products featured prominently under the Jumia Local feature. “We believe manufacturing in Kenya brings great benefits to the country. "Through this programme we seek to support the entrepreneurs who are investing in Kenya by clearly labelling their products, thus giving customers the chance of buying local consciously” said Jumia Local Project Manager Abigail Bundi. Percentage commission Jumia will charge one per cent commission for products sold through its platform for the first three months, after which the figure will be reviewed in response to market demand. Kenya Association of Manufacturers chief executive Phyllis Wakiaga called on local manufacturers to leverage on the e-commerce platforms to boost product visibility and to push the “buy Kenya” agenda. “We are taking this program very seriously as we work towards having as many products listed by the manufacturing sector as one of the ways of encouraging a culture of buying Kenyan to build Kenya through Jumia and also use it to brand our local products for the international market,” she said.

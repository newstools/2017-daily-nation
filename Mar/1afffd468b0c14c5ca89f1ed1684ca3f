Marsabit Governor Ukur Yatani has blamed his political rival for an attack on his motorcade at Dambalafachana by a group of goons. The governor condemned the attack and claimed that the goons are supporters of his opponent Mohamud Ali. His motorcade was stoned as he left a political rally in Moyale Town on Saturday night. “The attack was unfortunate and was as a result of the work of a coward, someone sensing defeat for the second time,” said Mr Yatani. The governor said his team had managed to stabilise the county and enhance cohesion among all communities. “Such acts can take us back to [the] dark times of ethnic clashes. The police should take charge and arrest the goons who caused the damage,” he added. However, Mr Ali said he did not organise any goons nor is he sensing defeat. Meanwhile, Mr Yatani has urged people living along the border with Ethiopia to cooperate with the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments in order to maintain peace in the region. The governor said that the Ethiopian government needs to take charge of its people as they are the main cause of the disagreements. “We have had a good relationship and we have held peace meetings with the Ethiopian government trying to resolve the issues along the border on several occasions. "However, our neighbours should take charge of their people to avoid more conflicts,” said Mr Yatani.

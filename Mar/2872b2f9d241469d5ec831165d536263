Ngong racecourse saw our determined Happy Times (Richard Kibet), vanquishing Rifle Range and River King over a grueling 2,800m in the Brigade of Guards Trophy, posting some stupefying past reflections. Strictly on merit, Happy Times did not stress, keeping right up there, dictating a tropical pace. Hawker Fury never combusted as expected, allowing stable 'compadre', Caen (Mark Mburu), to blitz the Air Force Cup. Caen initiated a customary treble for trainer, Onesmus Mutaua. Must say that the Tankard evolved strangely. Only three runners remained after Veterinary withdrawals, and, they were perfectly content to dawdle for a few furlongs. Hence a warped time of 3:20:1/10 was recorded - roughly a minute too slow. Eternal (Daniel Tanui), eventually activated his lethargy to tightly restrain Mama Mia, while Ari G got lost in translation. A law should be introduced against such crawling! Platinum Card ran really well in the Warges Handicap, monitored by a camera finish. An energizing competitive event, which saw her fail by only a couple of lengths. Hebrews and Maasai King benefited from weight allowances.

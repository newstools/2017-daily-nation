Wiper Democratic Movement Kalonzo Musyoka has claimed some Nasa and Jubilee Party members have bribed opinion pollsters to influence the public ahead of the August General Election. The Nasa co-leader said Kenyans are tired of cooked figures released by opinion pollsters during this electioneering period. Addressing residents at Gongoni in Magarini, Kilifi, during his second day of Coast tour to seek support for Wiper party and the Nasa coalition, he warned the opinion pollsters against playing with the minds of Kenyans, referring to their findings as “the highest form of corruption”. “Kenyans are now tired after being lied to for a long time. You do not even know Gongoni or where I am currently speaking from,” he said, adding that “those paying them to manipulate figures are Jubilee members and some members of the Nasa coalition.” Mr Musyoka, together with fellow Nasa principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya), are set to choose the Nasa flagbearer next month. He said this time round they are going to deal with them (opinion poll firms) head on. He criticised the latest opinion poll that suggested he is the second most preferred candidate in Nasa, saying the figure “does not tally with a person like him who has worked as a vice-president”. Last Saturday, Infotrak released opinion polls showing Mr Odinga enjoys huge support among Nasa supporters with 68.3 per cent recommending his candidature for the ticket. Mr Musyoka comes second with 13.1 per cent, while ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi is third with 12.3 per cent. Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula stands at 2.2 per cent. Mr Kalonzo was accompanied by Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana, former ambassador Ali Chirau Mwakwere, Kilifi gubernatorial aspirant Michael Tinga and his Kisii counterpart Lumumba Nyaberi, among other aspirants in Kilifi County. Later, they proceeded to Malindi Stadium for a rally.

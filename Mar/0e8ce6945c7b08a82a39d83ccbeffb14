There has been a considerable level of debate over the past week about the reports of bullying that have emerged from the Alliance High School. As the oldest school for African students in Kenya, it is natural developments in this prestigious institution should attract national attention. However, it would be a disservice to society to react to this scandal by simply charging a few teenagers and dismissing one principal. The developments are not entirely surprising. In many institutions, a culture of bullying of juniors has persisted for a long time. The expectation in most cases, was that this bullying would occur through psychological rather than physical means. The cases which have been reported of students undergoing extreme physical assault, with some being left unable to walk, are utterly shocking. However, these developments reflect a culture that has persisted for decades in many institutions. It is a throwback to colonial attitudes to schooling, which saw the inculcation of traditions sometimes through methods that verged on physical abuse as a critical rite of passage. The time has come to change this approach. It is utterly unfair to pin the blame on decades of bad behaviour on a few young men. Instead, there should be candid discussion on changes that need to be implemented, including overhauling the colonial structure of the prefecture and bring these critical institutions to the modern age.

Ahmad Ahmad, head of the Madagascar Football Association, is the new Confederation of African Football (Caf) president. Ahmad ousted the veteran Cameroonian leader Hayatou after 29 years in office. Ahmad, a father of two, won the election at Addis Ababa by 34 votes to Hayatou's 20. The 57-year-old had a discreet playing and coaching career before he took the reins of the Madagascar football federation in 2003. His rare and determined bid for "change" at the head of Caf this year took many by suprise, and the incumbent was seen in most quarters as a favourite. "When you try do something, you mean that you can do it," Ahamd told reporters after the vote. I cant do it, I never stand." Hayatou has been the head of Caf since 1988 and is a senior vice president of Fifa. He has been credited with increasing the number of African teams at the World Cup and bringing in extra finance for the continent's competition. "The losers of today may become the winners of tomorrow. Football is unity and its cohesion, and the organisation has to continue in it," the frail Hayatou said in his last speech as president. "I urge you, whatever may be your decision, to choose unity, the choice of solidarity, the winning choice. The choice that will allow Africa to remain solid and assert it full potential on the global football arena," added the veteran Cameroonian.   The Cameroonian official remains favourite.

Police are looking for a house help who stole a gun from her employer in Lavington on Wednesday. The house girl, identified as Florence Nabwire, broke the safe and made away with the firearm and money of different denominations at 11am while her employer was at work. 9 BULLETS Police say she escaped in the company of an unknown number of people on a yellow motor vehicle, registration number KAC 262H. Dagoretti police chief Rashid Mohammed on Thursday told the Nation said her employer, the wife to a licensed civilian firearm holder, reported that she arrived home to find the doors to the safe wide open. This was after the security guard informed her that the house help was leaving the house. “The Ceska Pistol had nine rounds of ammunition and we have already started investigations into the loss,” Mr Mohammed said. NO ARRESTS He said no arrests had been made but he was optimistic that they would find the girl and her accomplices by the end of the day.

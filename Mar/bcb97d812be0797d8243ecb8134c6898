Mavoko MP Patrick Makau has distanced himself from the woes facing former Kibwezi MP Kalembe Ndile following a raid on his home by auctioneers on Wednesday. Mr Makau has asked Mr Ndile to leave him out of his problems. Mr Ndile, who is seeking to oust Mr Makau, had sought to associate Mr Makau with an early morning raid on his Syokimau home by people in three vehicles, said to be auctioneers. Mr Ndile claimed that the raid was the work of his political enemies and pointed an accusing finger at Mr Makau. He added that his life was in danger. But it later turned out that the men who had raided his home were acting on court orders. COURT ORDERS The orders had been issued by the Employment and Labour Relations Court in a case where two former employees of Mr Ndile are seeking money owed to them. “Kalembe should learn to deal with his problems,” Mr Makau told the Nation by phone. “If he owes people money, what has that got to do with me?” he asked. He described Mr Ndile as “politically spent” and desperately seeking relevance by dragging his (Mr Makau’s) name into his problems. NOT RIVAL “Get this clearly, Kalembe is not my rival and I am not in competition with him. The man has lost relevance in Ukambani. “He cannot hold a meeting anywhere in Mavoko. Everywhere he goes the people are chasing him away,” said Mr Makau. “You honestly can’t say Kalembe and I are rivals. [Real] rivalries are like the ones between (Ferdinand) Waititu and (William) Kabogo in Kiambu, and (Mwangi) Wa Iria and Jamleck (Kamau) in Murang’a. Kalembe does not play in my league, he is way beneath me,” added Mr Makau. He claimed that Mr Ndile belongs to the breed of politicians whose era is long gone. “There was a time when politicians like Mulu Mutisya, Ezekiel Bargetuny and Kihika Kimani became popular due their comic value. That time has passed and Kalembe should have realised that by know,” he said.   Intruders seeking to recover money owed to Kibwezi ex-MP's former employees.

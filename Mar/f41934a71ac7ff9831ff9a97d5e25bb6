Former Nyeri Governor Nderitu Gachagua's body has arrived in Nairobi. The airplane carrying the body arrived from London, where he died, on Friday morning ahead of burial on Monday. The Kenya Airways flight landed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport at around 4.40am where a short prayer service was held.   The body was accompanied by his two daughters Susan and Mercy, other family members, Kenyan High Commissioner to the UK and friends. Family members led by his widow, Margaret Karugaru, county leaders and other governors received the body. Mr Gachagua, 64, died last week after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.   MPs Ndung'u Githinji (Tetu)Â and Esther Murungi (Nyeri Town ) eulogised Mr Gachagua as a great leader. The body was later taken to Lee Funeral Home. The family will hold a final mass on Monday before his burial in Nyeri.   Mr Gachagua's family invited Kenyans to join them in burying him, regardless of political leanings. Mr Rigathi Gachagua, the former governor's brother, said during the mass that his family is extending an invitation to everyone because he was only a politician expected to brush with some and make friends with others.   Nyeri County boss was undergoing treatment at Royal Marsden Hospital.

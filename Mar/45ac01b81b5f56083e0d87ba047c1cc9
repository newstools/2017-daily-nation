The basis of social order remains a healthy respect for private property. But this is under threat; all because some boda boda (motorcycle taxi) operators have decided that they will be burning other people’s motor vehicles every time one of them is involved in a traffic crash. This trend poses a mortal danger to society. It creates the impression that the motorcyclists — and they are thousands of them in every county — have become a law unto themselves. And not just that. They are the investigators, the prosecutors and the jury all rolled into one. Woe unto any motorist who falls foul of these new sheriffs. Yet, these boda boda operators remain the most undisciplined and reckless road users. In fact, most of them should not be on the road at all. The recent incident in Nakuru County, in which they torched trucks in Molo Township this week, is still fresh in the mind. Millions of shillings worth of investment went up in flames, just because one motor vehicle was involved in an accident with one motorcycle. The message that the boda boda operators are sending out is that this is their accepted way of dealing with road accident cases. But this cannot be — and should not be — accepted as the new way of handling road crashes. We have rules and enforcing agencies. That is why the police and other arms of government, especially the courts, must send an unequivocal message that this is not how the country will be resolving its traffic offences. The police must reclaim their authority and deal decisively with such unruly fellows and their backers. Those who take the law into their own hands must be subjected to the full force of the law, even if they enjoy political patronage. Unless this is done quickly, we will soon be confronted with a virulent strain of mob justice and street violence that will be difficult to stamp out. Today, the motorcyclists are attacking motorists. There is no telling who their next targets will be. This madness must be stopped urgently.

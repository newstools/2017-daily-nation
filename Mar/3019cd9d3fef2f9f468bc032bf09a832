An 60-year-old woman has been charged in a Nairobi court with collecting rent from a property developed by a suspected member of Al Shabaab and wiring the money to Kismayu, Somalia. Rose Awinja Ondumu denied two charges of dealing with property owned by a terrorist and collecting of funds for the benefit of terrorists. Awinja denied that in a span of four years at Umoja Estate Nairobi within Nairobi County, she knowingly dealt directly with a property owned by Mr Anwar Yogan Mwok, a member of Al- Shabaab. The prosecution said the house is located at Nasra Gardens Estate plot number 157/826 Zone B within Umoja II. The property neighbours Mama Lucy Hospital. It is built on a property that is subject of a case that has been pending in court for the last 45 years. The dispute of ownership of some 818 acres worth Sh5 billion pits Kiambu Dandora Farmers Company Limited and Dandora Housing Schemes Limited (DHSL). DHSL has been battling to repossess the land, which it claims has been grabbed by powerful people. This is the land where Nasra Gardens Estate has been developed, Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi heard. The second charge stated that she has been collecting funds for the benefit of a terrorist contrary to Section 5 (b) of the prevention of terrorism Act 2012. She denied that on December 1, 2013 and March 15, 2017 at Umoja Estate she collected house rent knowing that such funds would be used to benefit Mr Mwok. Awinja applied to be released on bond saying she is sickly and that she is on medication. She was freed on Sh500,000 bond. The case will be heard on April 18.

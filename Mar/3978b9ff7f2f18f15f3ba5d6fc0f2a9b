Mortgage financier HF Group has reported a 24.3 per cent drop in net profit in the year ended December 2016, hurt by reduced property sales. The company’s net earnings stood at Sh905.8 million in the period compared to Sh1.1 billion a year earlier. This came as “other income”, largely property sales, dropped 43.9 per cent to Sh430.4 million. Chief executive Frank Ireri said the company’s property development unit HFDI has Sh1 billion worth of transactions tied up at the lands ministry where operations have slowed down.

The conservative payout comes ahead of the maturity of its Sh7 billion corporate bond on October 2. The firm’s loan book expanded 2.7 per cent to Sh54.4 billion, helping to raise total interest income 6.2 per cent to Sh8.6 billion. Interest expenses increased 4.1 per cent to Sh4.6 billion despite customer deposits declining 8.5 per cent to Sh38 billion, indicating higher rates offered to depositors.

Murang’a Woman representative Sabina Chege has urged women to seek more political representation ahead of the elections. Ms Chege said women have the capability of being great leaders and hence should not shy away from seeking public office. "For better governance and prosperity, I challenge women to rise up and contest for public offices," she said. Speaking in Makuyu Teachers College after opening a sensitisation forum on women and leadership, she further appealed to them to avoid depending on being nominated by their respective parties, saying that is not the only way of getting into leadership. In the last election, not a single woman was elected as governor or senator, and none in Murang’a vied for either positions. Only Kandara MP Alice Wahome was elected as a legislator out of seven constituencies in Murang'a. Women aspirants have complained about harassment ranging from physical to verbal abuse from supporters of their opponents. They have also said they do not have the capital to conduct campaigns unlike their male counterparts, which limits their engagement. The two thirds gender rule has not yet been fully implemented.

Mathew Odongo scored Sharks’ consolation for Sharks in added time. GOR DOMINATED The 2015 champions served up a performance worthy of title contenders as coach Marcelo Ferreira experimented with 3-5-2 formation a second time. Earlier on at the same venue, 2008 champions Mathare United came from behind to overcome Thika United 3-2, in the process registering a brilliant start to the new season. At the Awendo Green Stadium, hosts Sony Sugar lost 2-0 to Chemelil Sugar as ten-man Posta Rangers demonstrated superiority over newly-promoted side Zoo Kericho by defeating them 1-0 at the Afraha stadium. In Thika, K’Ogalo defender Harun Shakava opened the scoring in the 17th minute, running wide to position himself on target to receive a long ball and headed it past former Mathare United goalkeeper Robert Mboya. After 20 minutes of trying, new signing from Rwanda JeanBaptiste Mugiraneza opened his account in the Kenyan league with a superb finish to give the 15-time champions a comfortable and well deserving lead heading into the break.

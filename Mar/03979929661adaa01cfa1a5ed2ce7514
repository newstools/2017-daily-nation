Singer Otile Brown who parted ways with his manager Dr. Eddie has declined to reveal why they are no longer working together. “I don’t want to talk about it because it won’t do any good; all it will do is cause arguments. I’m not talking to the media about it and I don’t want to fight with the guy,” The Niseme Nawe singer tells Showbuzz. On his Instagram page, Brown announced; “…I am no longer working or in any other partnership with Dreamland Music owned by Dr.Eddie... In case of any business deals that involve me (under the mentioned management) kindly be informed that I won’t be involved nor partake,”

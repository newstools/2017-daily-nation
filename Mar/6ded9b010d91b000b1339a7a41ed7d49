An aspirant for the Migori governor’s seat has asked the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) to allow members to vote using their mobile phones in the nominations, saying this will protect women aspirants from violence. Ms Anne Anyanga, who claims to have been rigged out in the 2013 primaries, said that women candidates need protection from their male counterparts whom she said often resort to violence. “I am calling on ODM to have the nominations done via (mobile) phone by the registered members. "When we do these nominations online, people get a fair chance and women are not shoved around,” said Ms Anyanga. She spoke after she launched her website, www.anneanyanga.com. “Holding the nominations [by] phone will offer a level-playing field for women. “It will no longer be about who is stronger physically, but who really has the numbers,” said Ms Anyanga. She has created an audio clip of her manifesto that she said is being distributed all over the county.

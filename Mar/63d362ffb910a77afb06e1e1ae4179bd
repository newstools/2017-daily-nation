A criminal case against former Lands Cabinet Secretary Charity Ngilu touching on the Sh8 billion Karen land has been terminated. The court on Monday dropped the case following a Court of Appeal order that declared the trial unconstitutional. Mrs Ngilu was on June 19 charged with obstructing the commission officials from investigating the 134-acre Karen land scandal. Mr Paul Muite presented a Court of Appeal order issued on March 6 in which appellate judges Alnashir Visram, Wanjiru Karanja and Jamila Mohamed declared Mrs Ngilu's trial as unconstitutional and directed the anti-corruption court to terminate the charge. Mr Muite told Senior Principal Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi that it is only the case of his client that was terminated, but the seven other suspects will go to full trial. The magistrate directed the Director of Public Prosecution to amend the charge sheet and remove Mrs Ngilu's name. Speaking after the termination of the case, Mrs Ngilu said she has forgiven her aggressors and that she knew from the beginning that the case will be withdrawn.   He said the CS could not have then turned around to obstruct investigations she had initiated.

On Monday, they were involved in the final preparations for the third edition of the annual fair. UoN vice chancellor Prof Peter Mbithi said both local and international innovators will take part. From last week, the institution has been receiving funds from partners including Barclays Bank, Kenya Climate Innovation Centre, Kenya Commercial Bank, Safaricom, Techno Mobile, Uber, university of Nairobi Alumni Association, NIC Bank, Chase Bank, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) among others to help in making the event a success.

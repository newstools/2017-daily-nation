The Marakwet Council of Elders has welcomed the ongoing security operation commissioned by the government last week in the volatile Kerio Valley to restore law and order. A gun-wielding criminals have for the past 10 months caused death and mayhem in the region prompting the government action. The elders have, at the same time, asked the government to investigate elected leaders from West Pokot and Baringo counties said to be opposing the security operation aimed at flushing out bandits in the volatile region. Addressing journalists on Monday in Eldoret, the elders said since the security operation started, hundreds of families who had fled their homes have retured. At the same time, public schools which had been shut down due to insecurity have re-opened, said their chairman, Andrew Chemweno. ELDERS HAPPY “We are happy that the situation on the ground is fast returning to normal. “Our people who had fled their homes are coming [back] and we can only attribute this to the ongoing security operation in the region," said Mzee Chemweno. He was accompanied by former MPs Robert Kipkorir (Marakwet East), Francis Mutuol (Marakwet West MP) and former Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) board director David Kalesi. Mzee Chemweno asked the government to investigate leaders who are opposed to the security operation. "We are asking the government to investigate elected leaders from neighbouring counties of West Pokot and Baringo who are opposed to the security operation to flush out bandits in the region," said Mzee Chemweno. According to Mzee Chemweno, development projects which had previously stalled due to the conflict are now on course.   Victim suffers leg and chest gunshot wounds.

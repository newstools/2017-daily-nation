Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has said the National Super Alliance (Nasa) is ready for the August general elections despite the coalition not having declared its presidential flag bearer. The governor said the coalition has organised itself and is confident of dethroning the ruling Jubilee administration during the August poll. He spoke during the celebrations to mark the International Women’s Day at Chumani on Wednesday, where he told the Jubilee Party to stop meddling in Nasa matters by claiming that the opposition is not ready for the elections. “We are fed up with this issue of Jubilee always claiming that we are not ready for the polls. "What they need to ask is whether the IEBC is ready for the general election. "We are always ready because we know we shall send them home,” he said. Mr Kingi, who backed Mr Odinga’s bid for the Nasa presidential flag bearer said they have nothing to fear in the polls but said IEBC should come out clearly and tell Kenyans how ready they are because Nasa does not want a bungled poll in August. Mr Kingi accused Jubilee of bragging about donor-funded projects that in the end turn to be burden for tax payers. His sentiment came a day before President Uhuru Kenyatta was expected to visit the county to inspect the ongoing construction of the Sh4.1 billion, 100km Malindi-Sala Gate road before commissioning medical equipment at the Malindi Sub-County Hospital. Governor Kingi said that President Uhuru and his Deputy William Ruto have nothing to boast about the equipment insisting it is a debt that the people of Kilifi will have to pay back to the national government.

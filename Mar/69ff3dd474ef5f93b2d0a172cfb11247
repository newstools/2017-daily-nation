Many will recall the slogan “Water for all by 2000”, which was a magical deadline by which the country had hoped to give all its citizens access to clean and safe drinking water. Well, the year 2000 came and passed, and to date, many Kenyans still dream of having a regular water supply. In some areas, fetching water is a fully fledged occupation that accounts for a substantive portion of the people’s time. In the pastoralist societies, some trek up to 20 kilometres to fetch water. And, of course, they do not have the capacity to ferry much back to their homes and will have to return soon, making this a dreary chore. However, it is not a problem for only people in the remote areas. The residents of Nairobi and other towns have long forgotten about the possibility of getting water daily. If they are lucky, they receive some water once a week. World Water Day on Wednesday was not about fun but an occasion for deep reflection on how to overcome the scourge on water shortages by investing in tapping, harvesting and distribution. Water coverage in the country stands at 55 per cent, which means that a staggering 21 million Kenyans, nearly 45 per cent of the population, lack access to clean water. This is unacceptable. Kenya needs to invest more in developing water sources and distribution to take full advantage of this natural resource. Besides boosting irrigation, rain water harvesting must be prioritised.

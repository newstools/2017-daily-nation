The 42nd edition of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships will take place on Sunday in Kampala, Uganda. More than 550 athletes from 59 countries and one refugee team from South Sudan will take part in the biennial competition considered one of the most difficult races to win due to the tough course. Team Kenya, which has been in camp for the last one month, has a formidable 30 athletes. The rich field has among them senior men’s defending champion Geoffrey Kamworor and women’s champion Agnes Tirop, among others. The competition will be held at the Kololo Independence Srounds, the scene of Uganda’s independence celebrations on October 9, 1962. Kenya and Ethiopia have dominated the races since 1981. This year’s competition will for the first time feature mixed relays, which will precede the main races. We expect Kenyan athletes to once again show their prowess by sweeping all the races on show. It is also encouraging that thousands of Kenyans have travelled to Kampala to support our team. We wish our athletes all the best.

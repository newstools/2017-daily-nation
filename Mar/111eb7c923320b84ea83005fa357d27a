Doctors who participated in the 100-day strike will not be paid for the days they were away from duty, the government has said. The order, which comes barely a week after the State and the doctors' union signed a return to work formula to bring an end to the impasse, affects doctors both at national level and in the counties. CIRCULAR In a letter to the Council of Governors (COG) chairman Peter Munya dated March 17, Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri directed that the doctors will only be paid with effect from the date they reported back on duty. “For the doctors who did not participate in the strike, the emergency call allowances and medical risk allowances will be paid with effect from January 1, 2017,” said Dr Muraguri. Another circular from the COG to all counties also echoes the directive from the national government. Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) secretary-general Ouma Oluga said that the move amounts to victimisation by their employer. SH36,000 “Not paying salaries goes against the spirit of the return to work formula, which is self-explanatory as pertains victimisation,” said Dr Oluga. For those that did not participate in the strike, the emergency call allowance shall be paid monthly. Medical interns in Job Group L will be paid an additional Sh36,000, bringing the total payable allowance Sh66,000. Doctors in Job Group M, N and P are to be paid an additional Sh42,000, which makes the total payable Sh72,000, while specialists in Job Group Q and above are to be paid an additional Sh50,000, which makes the total payable Sh80,000. All doctors are also to be paid a uniform medical risk allowance of Sh20,000 monthly.   KMPDU asks Medical Association of Tanzania to delay deployment of its members to Kenya by two months.

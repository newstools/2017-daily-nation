The Embu County administration has launched a Sh40 million school milk programme. Governor Martin Wambora said the initiative targets pupils in kindergarten. He said consultations were held before the idea was implemented and that it is not politically motivated. Speaking at Embu stadium during the launch, Mr Wambora said the county assembly would be roped in so that it can set aside money to run the programme. Mr Wambora said it targets 17,000 learners, who will be given milk thrice a week to boost their health as well as promote the dairy industry; by sourcing the produce from the farmers. Kenya Dairy Board Chairman Anthony Mutugi said nutrition remains a key challenge nationwide, particularly among school going children, which has affected education. "This has contributed to malnutrition and other easily avoidable diseases. This poor state of nutrition and health ultimately affects school enrolment, performance and retention," he said.

Former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga on Thursday got reprieve after Political Parties Disputes tribunal extended the deadline for submission of nomination papers by two weeks.A five-member tribunal issued the directive in a case in which Mr Njenga sued Jubilee Party for rejecting his nomination papers for the Laikipia Senatorial seat.The decision was reached after the tribunal was told that Jubilee Party (JP) had not yet responded to the case hence no hearing could proceed and a ruling to be made as earlier scheduled.The panel had also been told that Friday is the countrywide deadline for submission of nomination documents for aspirants who wish to vie in the August 8 polls on a Jubilee Party ticket. We direct that the deadline for the submission of nomination papers only for the Laikipia Senator Position be extended by 14 days. Jubilee should respond for a hearing and further directions next Tuesday, the tribunal said.The tribunal was expected to give a ruling on whether to issue a temporary order compelling Jubilee Party to accept his nomination papers unconditionally.Through lawyer Evans Ondieki, Mr Njenga had dragged JP before the tribunal while protesting the rejection of his nomination papers on grounds that he had already paid Sh250,000 as requisite fees among other huge sums of monies for Jubilee campaigns.He accused the party of infringing on his political right while claiming that he has already complied with other legal requirements such as producing clearance certificate of good conduct, compliance from Kenya Revenue Authority, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Credit Reference Bureau. The decision to reject my nomination papers on account of instructions from the party leader and his deputy is dictatorial, unreasonable and unjustified in an open and just democratic society, having accepted my registration and nomination fee, Mr Njenga said.Apart from the registration and nomination fees which he claimed to have already paid, he argued that it is wrong for his bid to be thwarted after spending a considerable amount of monies on mobilization, printing of t-shirts, posters, jackets, caps, banners and branding of vehicles.He claims to have spent over Sh100 million campaigning.Mr Njenga wants it declared that the decision by JP to reject his nomination papers is illegal, null and void.The former Mungiki leader also wants it declared that his political rights have been infringed hence JP should be compelled to protect the rule of law in his case.He had also sued the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) but the tribunal directed that the electoral body be excluded from the dispute.Last week, the Jubilee Secretariat rejected his papers while citing integrity issues'.But he argues that he is a born again Christian. email print email print The murder deal fell apart after Muthoni failed to pay the killers the balance of Sh300,000.

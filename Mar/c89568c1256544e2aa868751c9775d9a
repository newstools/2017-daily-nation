The suspended Kenya’s off-spin bowler, James Ngoche, is working with a Pakistan National Cricket Academy coach, to rectify his his bowling action. Ngoche was suspended from bowling in international matches by International Cricket Council’s bowling action review panel that found his bowling action illegal during the July 2015 World Twenty20 qualifiers jointly hosted by Ireland and Scotland. According to Kenya’s national team coach, Thomas Odoyo, only the Pakistan National Cricket Academy coach can determine when Ngoche should be taken for testing in an ICC-accredited facility. PROPER DRILL He said: “At the moment we can do nothing. That coach must be satisfied that Ngoche is undergoing a proper drill. The two individuals communicate with each other on regular basis through video clips.  Ngoche is supposed to adopt a different bowling action from the one he was used to and that is not an easy task.” Ngoche attended Pakistan’s National Cricket Academy last August together with Kenyan team mates Gurdeep Singh, Rushab Patel and Pushpak Kerai. During their 21-day stay in Lahore, Ngoche underwent unofficial testing of his bowling action as part of his remedial work at the Pakistan Cricket Board’s biomechanics centre, Lahore. His Pakistani coach advised him not to take part in local tournaments so as not interfere with his progress.

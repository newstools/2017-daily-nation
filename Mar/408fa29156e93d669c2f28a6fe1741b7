The Opposition is to blame for anger displayed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, three cabinet secretaries said on Sunday. The trio; Fred Matiang’i (Education), Mwangi Kiunjuri (Devolution and Planning) and Charles Keter (Energy), tore into Opposition leaders for constantly provoking the President by their persistent attacks on his development record. They said some opposition leaders have been poking their fingers into the President’s eyes forcing him to react. Speaking on Sunday at Nyambera DOK Primary School in Kisii Town after a funds drive for Kisii Town Catholic Parish, they defended the President’s ‘outbursts’ saying his critics had received a dose of their own medicine. “They have been intruding the President’s meetings and trying to paint him negatively in the name of seeking for political mileage. We know they are lying because the projects initiated by the Jubilee government are visible,” said Mr Kiunjuri. He said those who have been conning Kenyans since independence are well known and Kenyans should avoid them by ensuring they are not elected to power. Dr Matiang’i asked religious leaders to intervene by telling Kenyans the truth about who the real cons are. “We have all seen the tremendous projects initiated by Jubilee government. You cannot stand on a platform and dispute this. Those not seeing are the ones with a problem,” he said. Energy CS Charles Keter said the Jubilee scorecard on development is clear and no amount of hoodwinking will deter them from delivering their promises. Former CIC Chairman Charles Nyachae asked Kisii residents not to fall into the trap of the opposition whom he said lack the will and agenda to develop the country. Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tongi who was also in attendance said the Gusii residents stand to gain more while in government.

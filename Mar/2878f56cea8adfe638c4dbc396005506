National Land Commission (NLC) Chairman Muhammad Swazuri has ordered the United Arab Emirates to return to the Kenya Railways pension scheme a piece of land in Nairobi’s Upper Hill area that former President Daniel arap Moi gave its ruler. Dr Swazuri issued the directive after the commission found that the land was initially allocated to the Kenya Railways Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme (KRSRBS) in 1965, and that Mr Moi’s decision to gift the prime property to UAE ruler Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan 25 years ago was illegal. The NLC has, consequently, ordered the chief land registrar to revoke a title deed Mr Al Nahyan was given in 1990 for the prime property that is estimated to be worth Sh500 million and revert its ownership to the KRSRBS. Mr Moi gave Mr Al-Nahyan the land in January 1990 to construct the Sheikh Zayed Children Welfare Centre. Mr Al-Nahyan was the man behind the formation of UAE in 1971 and ruled the country for 33 years until his death in 2004 at the age of 85.

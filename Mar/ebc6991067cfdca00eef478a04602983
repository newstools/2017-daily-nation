Police have interrogated Meru Governor Peter Munya’s employees following the disappearance of his firearm, 50 rounds of ammunition and documents from his house in Garden Estate, Nairobi on Saturday. Mr Munya reported the disappearance of the Ceska pistol, which was loaded with 14 bullets to the Kasarani Police Station. Kasarani OCPD Robinson Mboloi said the governor reported that he discovered a safe containing the pistol, extra rounds of ammunition, his personal documents and other belongings had disappeared from his house. “He reported to the police immediately and we have started investigations into the matter,” Mr Mboloi said. Police have questioned the house help, the watchmen and the governor. The incident comes just two weeks after a house help, who was identified as Florence Nabwire, stole her employer’s pistol in Lavington. She broke the safe and made away with the firearm that was loaded with nine bullets and money while her employer was at work. Police later recovered the pistol and arrested three people, who had dumped the firearm by the roadside in Dagoretti the same evening. Dagoretti OCPD Rashid Mohammed said the house help is still at large but police are pursuing her.   Separately, Ipoa employees lose laptops and cash to robbers in Shanzu, Mombasa.

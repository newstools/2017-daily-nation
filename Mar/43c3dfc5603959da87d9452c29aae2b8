Barclays Africa Group will sponsor local caddies of the top two players at this year’s Barclays Kenya Open to South Africa’s premier celebrity golf event, Telkom SuperSport Shoot out, in May. The sponsorship will see the Kenyan golfers serve as caddies in the tournament and will also participate in a clinic at the Absa Caddies Academy organised by the Kenya Open title sponsors. A statement from Barclays Africa Group said the caddies scholarship, a first of its kind, is in line with the bank’s commitment to supporting the development of golf in Kenya by partnering in initiatives that build the capacity of caddies which will in turn improve the quality of the game. REFINING SKILLS The Academy will present an opportunity for caddies to refine their skills through a bespoke programme, which will include a session on the importance of financial management. Further, each of the participating caddies will be required to complete the Barclays flagship employability programme dubbed ‘ReadytoWork’. This sponsorship is anchored on the bank’s commitment to going beyond the greens this year, an idea which focusses on activities around the Barclays Kenya Open that contribute towards growth of the game. Muthaiga caddies chairman Austine Maina said the sponsorship is a great honour to caddies and would be a milestone towards ensuring that caddies get international exposure and grow professionally. “This is truly motivating and the caddies will put their best foot forward to assist their golfers perform their best,” he said yesterday at Mutahiga Club.   Saturday’s round is likely to decide those going for the title on Sunday.

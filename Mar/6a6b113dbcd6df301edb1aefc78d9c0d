Q: I reconnected with a former colleague on a professional networking site. After exchanging a few messages, he asked for my phone number. I gave it to him and we texted a bit. I suggested we catch up in person. But he said he d like to know more about me first, and asked if I was married. When I told him I was single, he said we should get to know each other better. I am stumped. I only suggested meeting as a couple of old colleagues. Was I too forward? Does he think I was suggesting a date?Unless your texts were flirty, this guy appears to be shopping for tomatoes at the hardware store - looking for dates on LinkedIn. Step away from the keyboard.

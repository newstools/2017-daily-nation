Safaricom has appointed former Information PS Bitange Ndemo to its board, seeking to tap his broad knowledge as a government technocrat and university lecturer. Vivek Badrinath, Vodafone’s regional chief executive for Africa, Middle East and Asia-Pacific, also joins Safaricom as a director to represent the interests of the British multinational. The former Orange Group executive replaces Serpil Timuray, who resigned last month from Safaricom’s board. “Both board members will bring vast talent and understanding of the global business landscape, as well as unique insights into the world of telecommunications to our business,” said Safaricom chairman Nicholas Ng’ang’a in a statement. “Our board will be enriched by their knowledge which will enhance Safaricom’s ability to navigate an increasingly multifaceted industry.” Dr Ndemo served as Information PS from 2005 to 2013 and currently teaches at the University of Nairobi’s Business School. In his current role, Mr Badrinath oversees Vodafone’s operations in the Vodacom Group, India, Australia, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Qatar, New Zealand and Turkey.

Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel on Wednesday has blamed politics for his arrest. He accused the Jubilee government of trying to sabotage him due to the growing number of ODM supporters in Laikipia. “Whatever they are going to do to me. I will stand for my people and for my president Raila Amolo Odinga,’’ said the MP on Wednesday evening. He was accompanied by lawyer James Orengo who had represented him in court. Mr Orengo expressed concerns that the jubilee administration is harassing opposition legislators. NIGHT BEHIND BARS “We regret that Mathew (Lempurkel) had to spend the night behind bars, we are ready to defend him everywhere and come the next general elections, Mathew will be very important,” said Mr Orengo. In what he termed as his special message to the British government, Mr Lempurkel told the UK and the world that the conflicts in Laikipia are as a result of drought due to global warming. He dismissed claims of inciting the public and sent condolences to the family of 60-year-old rancher and former British army soldier Tristan Voorspruy, who was killed by herders at his 24,000-acre Sosian Ranch. He was addressing his supporters who had earlier demonstrated outside the Nanyuki Law Courts following his arrest. He was released on Wednesday evening on a Sh200,000 cash bail.   Police say they plan to charge the Laikipia North lawmaker with the murder of Sosian ranch co-owner.

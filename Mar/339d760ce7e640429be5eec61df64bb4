Rift Valley will have peaceful elections despite the current insecurity challenges in some regions, the government has assured. Regional Coordinator Wanyama Musiambo said security departments have intensified operations to ensure peace prevails before elections. “Security agencies are ready for the elections. We are working hard to ensure that a repeat of 2007/08 post-election violence does not occur,” Mr Musiambo said on Friday. He was reacting to the recent banditry attacks in Baringo, adding the police are making a positive progress in curbing insecurity incidences. According to him, the re-opening of three schools that had been closed due to insecurity was a positive sign. Parts of Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, Pokot and Laikipia counties have been worst hit by insecurity leaving dozens of people dead and scores injured since January. The most recent attacks happened on Wednesday where 11 people were killed by suspected Pokot bandits who raided Mukutani village in Tiaty. Most affected were women and children, some who are fighting for their lives in hospitals. President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday ordered the deployment of military forces to the troubled North Rift region to help police restore law and order. READ: Uhuru now deploys KDF to Baringo

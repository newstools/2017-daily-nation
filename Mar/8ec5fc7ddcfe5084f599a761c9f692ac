The government has defended its plan to put up a dry port in Naivasha, Nakuru County, and dismissed claims by the Opposition that it is intended to sabotage the Mombasa economy. State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu on Sunday it was not true that Naivasha was being set up to replace Mombasa either, terming the allegations farfetched. Mr Esipisu spoke a day after Deputy President William Ruto said the establishment of the port was a crucial component in the Jubilee government’s development agenda. Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and some leaders from the Coast have been on record opposing the plans, alleging a scheme to frustrate and “kill” the region’s economy by moving key port services to Naivasha. Mr Joho has consistently opposed the project, which he claims does not make economic sense given that there is a sea port in Mombasa. “Such a move will definitely create an employment crisis in the Coast region,” the Mombasa county boss has previously been quoted as saying.

Jubilee is implementing projects," said the DP. Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua has also criticised Mr Joho’s opposition to the project, accusing him of politicising the project and misleading Kenyans on the subject. Mr Joho however responded by telling his Nakuru counterpart that he does not comprehend the “complex economics” surrounding the issue.

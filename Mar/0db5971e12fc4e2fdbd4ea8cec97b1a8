The Local Organising Committee for the IAAF World Under-18 Championships will offer subsidised hotel rates to make it more affordable for journalists to use the official media hotel for the games. The championships’ chief executive officer Mwangi Muthee also announced that Kenya has set aside funds to enable foreign journalists covering the championships to tour the country’s top attractions besides reporting on the track and field action. Muthee was speaking on Wednesday when he met IAAF deputy director of communications Anna Legnani and Olaf Brockmann, the IAAF’s press delegate for the Nairobi championships, at Kasarani. “I have received approval to organise trips for groups of international media to tour beaches, national parks, mountains and so on, so that they have more to report about Kenya apart from the athletics action,” he said. Muthee disclosed that his Local Organising Committee will offer journalists accommodation at $40 (Sh4,000) for single rooms at the Kenya School of Monetary Studies rather that the usual rate of $60 (Sh6,000) with double rooms going for $60 instead of $85 (Sh8,500). “We shall top up the difference because our aim is to make the journalists as comfortable as possible while covering the championships,” Muthee noted.   The IAAF has advised Kenya to focus on delivering a world class event.

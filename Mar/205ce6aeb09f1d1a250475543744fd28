Nakuru gubernatorial aspirant Lee Kinyanjui has accused Governor Kinuthia Mbugua's administration of having little to show despite receiving more than Sh40bn of devolved funds over the last four years.On the other hand, Governor Mbugua has dismissed Mr Kinyanjui, terming him a perennial loser.Mr Kinyanjui, a former Nakuru Town MP who is making a second attempt to clinch the governor s seat, accused the incumbent of presiding over a looting regime."Sh44 billion has been released by the (National) Treasury but Wanjiku on the ground has nothing to celebrate because the county government cannot account for it," said Mr Kinyanjui.Mr Kinyanjui said many counties have made significant strides in healthcare while residents of places like Olenguruone in Nakuru County are traveling to neighbouring counties for medical services.HOSPITAL FUNDS DIVERTEDHe claimed that Sh600 million given by the national government to Nakuru Level Five Hospital was diverted and dished out in shady tender deals to friends and relatives of senior county officials."I shall not shy away from pinpointing the failures of this stinking regime because in terms of looting public resources it leads while others follow, and that is why I insist they should be in prison," added Mr Kinyanjui.However, Governor Mbugua denied the claims and accused his opponent of peddling falsehoods to win the people s support after having failed as an MP. My opponent is a perennial loser who has started sensing defeat and is now using all the dirty tricks to make up for his failures. But I wish to tell him it s too late as his poor development record speaks volumes, said Mr Mbugua.MBUGUA'S DEFENCEGovernor Mbugua defended his administration saying 41 dispensaries have been completed, 12 new maternity wings have been constructed and 10 are operational, Sh210 million was used to purchase hospital equipment, Sh770 million used to purchase drugs while all the 11 sub-counties have two ambulances each.In the trade sector, the governor said Sh480 million was spent to construct markets and 35 are now complete.He added that a total of 5,000 kilometres of roads have been completed, 100 bridges and two bus park terminuses built in Naivasha and Nakuru while in Gilgil the work is on-going.However, the governor admitted that the first term in office has been very difficult for him as the concept of devolution was not well understood.He said settling down was not easy with Members of County Assembly attempting to impeach him hardly one week after he assumed office. email print email print Analysts attribute the lull to political party intrigues as candidates wait for the primaries.

A university has received rare backing in its bid for compensation for loss of a controversial prime land in Nairobi that is also claimed by retired President Daniel arap Moi in case the purchase was fraudulent. Mr Moi has described the joinder of Ndungu Njoroge & Kwach Advocates and Paul Ndiritu Ndungu as sought by United States International University Africa (USIU-A) as necessary to help the court to settle all the questions involved in the suit. The lawyers have opposed it. “They are necessary parties to the suit due to the various acts taken by each party at various times regarding the illegal sale of my two parcels of land,” said Mr Moi in court papers. ABANDONED CLAIM USIU, which appears to have abandoned its claim over the land, has, in amended court papers said it will seek compensation at the current market value from the lawyers, whom it claims purchased the land on its behalf. Others it is seeking compensation from are ICEA Lion Life Assurance Company Ltd, which it says sold the land, and the Chief Land Registrar for not keeping proper land records, thereby exposing the land to fraudulent actions. The case will be heard on Tuesday.   Mr Moi has disowned an alleged transaction with Muthaiga Luxury Homes.

Herders in West Pokot County will benefit from livestock relief feed to cushion their animals from the ravaging drought that has hit the region. The National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) has started disbursing the first drought pellets worth Sh6 million in North Pokot and Central Pokot sub-counties. Herders have migrated to Uganda with hundreds of their animals in search of pasture and water. Due to the ongoing famine, 35 per cent of West Pokot residents are in dire need of food. The livestock feed programme targets an estimated 2,000 animals which were left behind after the migration to Uganda. West Pokot NDMA Response Officer Tim Letoya said the livestock relief feed is meant to help mitigate the drought effects being felt in the county. “We want to help herders in the area and save their livestock. North Pokot has received 1,000 bags of pellets, 189 bales of hay, 1,000 urea molasses [while] Pokot Central has received similar quantities,” he said. SUPPORT WEAK ANIMALS Mr Letoya said distribution has already begun in Kacheliba, Konyao, Kiwawa, Kasei and Alale in North Pokot sub-county, while in Central Pokot, distribution has begun in Sigor, Wakor and Marich. He said the drought pellets will go a long way in supporting weak animals. “Many livestock have died in Masol and Kiwawa areas,” he said. He was speaking at Konyao after flagging off the first consignment of the feeds. “West Pokot and South Pokot sub-counties are not included in the programme because we are responding to the December survey,” he said. He said the county government is also involved in other programmes aimed at mitigating hunger in the county. “We shall upscale the distribution of food which is currently being undertaken by the county government,” he said. Mr Letoya said NMDA is also working on other projects aimed at managing the disaster, which include water trucking and repairing of boreholes.

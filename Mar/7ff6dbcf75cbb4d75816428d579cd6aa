A man suspected of being a thief was lynched by locals in Ngangarithi village in Nyeri town. He was accused of stealing a carpet and attempting to break into one of the houses at 2am. One of the residents heard suspicious movements and raised alarm prompting neighbours to respond swiftly. "He was in the company of two accomplices who managed to escape through coffee bushes in a neighbouring farm. They had taken the carpet," Miriam Wanjiru said. The deceased was attacked and killed. The residents complained of soaring theft incidents. "There is increased theft of household items and burglary. Residents were angry and he fell victim of their wrath. We hope his accomplices will desist from criminal activities and learn a lesson," Jonah Kimani, a casual labourer, said. The body was taken to Nyeri Referral Hospital mortuary. Nyeri Central OCPD Kioko Muide said police are investigating the incident.

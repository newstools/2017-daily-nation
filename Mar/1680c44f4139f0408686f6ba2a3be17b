MOGADISHU, Wednesday Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrived in Somalia in a surprise visit today for talks with President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. The two leaders discussed issues devastating the country including drought and insecurity. They also talked about the Somali conference to be held in London in May. Somalia declared drought a national disaster with the United Nations warning that half of the country’s population, about six million people, are at risk. Last month, Britain pledged £100 million in new aid to Somalia in response to the crisis. It also pledged a similar amount to South Sudan similarly facing a devastating famine. On Wednesday, the British government said it will match the first £5 million ($6 million) donated by the public to a group of 13 United Kingdom aid agencies in a new fundraising appeal to help millions of people in East Africa. The UK’s Disasters Emergency Committee says at least 16 million people in Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya need food, water and medical treatment.

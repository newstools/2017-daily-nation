National Super Alliance co-principals have denied any division in the coalition and said they will select a flag bearer very soon. Speaking at a joint rally at Masinde Muliro grounds in Mathare, Nairobi, Mr Raila Odinga (ODM), Mr Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Mr Moses Wetang'ula (Ford-K) and Mr Musalia Mudavadi (Amani) dismissed claims of infighting over the coalition's flag-bearer as "propaganda spread by Jubilee". "All of us are in Nasa. Kalonzo is totally with us and there are no gaps," Mr Odinga, who arrived in the same vehicle with Mr Musyoka, said. He likened the flag-bearer position to a pretty woman who is being wooed but will only take one husband. INFIGHTING "In Nasa, we don't want infighting, this tent is big enough for all of us, even if it gets hot we will stay there," said Mr Mudavadi. At the same time, Mr Musyoka said they had no trust in the electoral commission, claiming it was keen on conducting manual elections. "We will have a parallel presidential tallying system complete with our own biometric system and tally the results on our own for credibility," he said. He also said it is not the monopoly of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission or the Jubilee government to ensure credible election.   Crucial meetings fail to take place without explanation as city rally moved to Friday.

Nairobi County does not conserve rain water despite heavy floods that are caused by rains during rainy seasons. This was revealed as the county marked World Water Day whose theme was “time to save water. Re-use to conserve’. Speaking at the inspectorate grounds in Dagoretti the county executive for water and environment Peter Kimori said that the city mainly depends on water from outside. He said that rain water is left to go to waste for lack of conservation points. “The water you see running in Nairobi is surface water which we do not use in our homes for drinking or cleaning…we outsource water from other counties,”said Eng Kimori. He added that the county is trying to come up with ways to conserve rain water for the purpose of using it in the city saying that it has carried out public awareness urging people to tap rain water by harvesting roof water. According to him, the county is also constructing a sewerage and recycling plant in from where rain water will be directed easing the burden of treated water for drinking by the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company. He added that the county has been recycling sewerage water at the Kariobangi sewer plant that is in city homes. The county is also set to launch the drilling of 40 boreholes by next week at a cost of Sh200 million, a move that will see the city address water shortage problems.

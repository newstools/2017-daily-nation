A Mombasa court has withdrawn a case against two sons of slain drug baron Ibrahim Akasha and an Indian national. Baktash Akasha, Ibrahim Akasha and Mr Vijaygiri Goswami had been charged with fighting in public. Senior Principal Magistrate Henry Nyakweba withdrew the charges following an application by Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alexander Muteti. The accused, together with Mr Gulam Hussein, were extradited to the United States in January for trial over narcotic trafficking offences. The withdrawal of the charges under Section 87(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code means the accused can be re-arrested and charged afresh. However, similar charges against Abdulsalam Akasha, who was charged with his brothers, will proceed, Mr Muteti told the court. Prosecution intends to consolidate Mr Abdulsalamâ€™s case with that of Mombasa tycoon Ali Punjani, who is facing similar charges. Mr Punjani appeared in court for the mention of the case on Thursday. The case has been fixed for mention on April 7.

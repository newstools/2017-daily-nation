LONDON Chelsea's Eden Hazard will decide on a move to Real Madrid at the end of the season, with the Spanish giants prepared to pay a world record transfer fee, according to former club president Ramon Calderon. The Belgium midfielder is under contract with Premier League leaders Chelsea until June 2020 but Hazard, a childhood fan of Real coach Zinedine Zidane, has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Bernabeu. But Calderon reckons it will cost Real a world record fee of £100 million ($125 million, 115 million euros, Sh12.5 billion) to make the move a reality. "Chelsea aren't a selling club, so it wouldn't be easy, but as always it would depend on the wishes of the player. If he wants to leave, he will leave — that's always the point," Calderon told Talksport Radio's Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on Tuesday. "It's all about the player. The player must say, 'I want to leave and go to Real Madrid', and that will be the moment they start negotiating." Hazard, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Lille in 2012, has regained his best form under Blues manager Antonio Conte, with west London club Chelsea 10 points in front at the top of the table with 10 league games of the season left. "Chelsea will ask for a lot of money, I think that's what the situation will be at the end of the season," Calderon said. "Chelsea knows quite well how much has been paid in the market over the last few years, with (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Gareth) Bale and (Paul) Pogba — £100 million is now the bar."

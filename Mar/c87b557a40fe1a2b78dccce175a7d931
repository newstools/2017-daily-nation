Three people died and several others injured in a road accident at Egesa on the Kisii-Marani road in Kisii County. The matatu, which was coming from Kisumu, was carrying eleven passengers and its driver when it crashed. One of the passengers, Mr Mogosi Getembe, said the driver lost control of the vehicle before landed in a ditch as he was trying to avoid hitting other vehicles. Mr Getembe blamed the many potholes on the road for the crash. "The driver was not even speeding. It is impossible to speed on that kind of road," said Mr Getembe. Mr James Mochama, a witness, said the matatu landed on its side as the driver tried to avoid colliding with oncoming vehicles. "These are not even potholes but (big) holes that stretch for several metres and are getting deeper each day. The road should be renovated immediately to avoid any other deaths," said Mr Mochama.

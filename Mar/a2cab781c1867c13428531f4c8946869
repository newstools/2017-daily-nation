One of Kenya s finest junior golfers Agil Is-Haq holds treasured memories of his maiden appearance at the Barclays Kenya Open tournament despite failing to make the cut.Is-Haq said he was not happy with his performance, having carded a two-round total of 167, but says the experienced gained from playing alongside European Challenge Tour stars was enormous. I expected to perform better than what I returned but pressure and a bad swing took tall on me, said the 16-year-old Is-Haq. I have gained a lot in terms of game management and how to stay mentally strong in tough conditions. Is-Haq, who holds the Windsor and Royal junior titles besides finishing second at National Strokeplay Championships, said he will continue to refine his game with the hopes of making a return to Kenya Open next year.But first things first, Is-Haq wants to make his presence felt at the Golfer-of-the-Year (Goty) Series before he can turn professional in future. I m yet to perform well in the few Goty events I have taken part in but the breakthrough is coming soon, said Is-Haq, adding that he will have more time for practice after finishing school in June.Is-Haq is currently on his 11th year at Light International School in Mombasa. My dream is to win the Kenya Open one day and take part in major tour events, said Is-Haq, who noted that local pros have continued to perform poorly at Kenya Open due to lack of exposure and tournaments.He said the few tournaments that come a few weeks before Kenya Open do not help local pros much. We can t compete effectively with the touring golfers who play weekly or after every two weeks, said Is-Haq. email print email print The best-placed Kenyan golfer is Dismas Indiza.

A special team of criminal investigators will be formed to address security concerns in the Rift Valley region. Director of Criminal Investigations Ndegwa Muhoro said the team will be assigned to volatile areas in Eldoret, Nandi, Laikipia and Kitale. The decision arose from a closed-door meeting in Nakuru on Thursday with top security chiefs in the region, Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and the county commissioner. Mr Muhoro said the officers will get the support they need to deliver the intended results. "We are here to assess the security situation of this region to ensure that the safety of every citizen is upheld," he said during the meeting. Mr Muhoro's tour comes against the backdrop of numerous insecurity incidents in parts of the region, including in Baringo, Elgeyo-Marakwet and Laikipia counties. In Laikipia County on Tuesday, herders invaded a private ranch and caused damage to property there.

"Nobody has a right to invade other citizensâ€™ property. Thus we are conducting investigations to ensure that the criminals are thoroughly dealt with," he said. He added that the government is working to address the issues arising between herders and ranch owners to end the wrangles.

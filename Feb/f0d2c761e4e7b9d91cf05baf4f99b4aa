MADRID One fan was seriously injured in violent clashes ahead of the La Liga fixture between Alaves and Barcelona in the northern city of Vitoria, Spanish police confirmed on Saturday. A group of between 40 and 50 hooded fans clashed before kick-off, although the police added no arrests have been made. The injured supporter has been taken to hospital suffering from head injuries. "Deportivo Alaves profoundly condemns the violent acts that took place this morning February 11, in the university zone between supposed fans of Alaves and FC Barcelona," Alaves said in a statement. "The club will put itself at the disposition of the authorities and, if it is confirmed that those implicated are season ticket holders, Deportivo Alaves will consider exemplary sanctions against those people." Videos released in the Spanish media showed fans throwing chairs and wielding metal bars. The match ended in a 6-0 Barcelona win. The two sides are due to meet again the Copa del Rey final on May 27.   Barcelona went top of La Liga for the first time since October with a 6-0 thrashing of Alaves on Saturday.

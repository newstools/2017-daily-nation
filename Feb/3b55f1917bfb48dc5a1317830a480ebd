The three-week biannual tournament has treated fans to top-notch football and surprise results, including Cameroon’s win over Senegal and Burkina Faso’s triumph over Tunisia in the quarter-finals. New stars have also emerged. The  likes of Cameroon goalkeeper Joseph Ondoa his compatriots Collings Ngoran, Sebastian Siai and Jacques Soaua, Congolese Jose M’Poku and Tunisia’s Nalim Sliti suddenly come to mind. Then there were the passionate fans, mainly attached to the west and north African teams. Cameroon’s contingent, with their elaborate costumes, songs and dances, would make Gor Mahia’s fanatics look like primary school kids, . When the moment of reckoning eventually came, the competition ended with a powerful message, as the tournament organisers dedicated close to two hours of the closing ceremony to sensitising fans on cancer. Top artistes from West African, including Josey, Charlotte Dipanda, Pamela Badjogo, Rokia Traore and Coumba Gawlo, sang songs in support of an Africa united against cancer.

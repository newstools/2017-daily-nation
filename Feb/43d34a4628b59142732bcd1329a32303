Former Kenya’s national team captain, Morris Ouma, blasted a quick half a century in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Twenty20 match to help his club Swamibapa beat Nairobi Gymkhana by nine wickets at Nairobi Jaffreys at the weekend. Ouma, who was unbeaten on 56 runs that came off 30 deliveries with four boundaries and four towering sixes, shared a wining second wicket partnership of 109 with Naman Patel (59 not out off 46 balls with four fours and a six). Batting first, Gymkhana set a target of 124 for the loss of nine wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Karan Kaul was Gymkhana’s highest runs getter with 74 off 50 balls with seven boundaries and two sixes. Veer Dave (19) was the only other Gymkhana batsman who posted double-digit figures on the board, four batsmen were dismissed four ducks and the rest  got single-digit figures. Saumil Patel was Gymkhana’s main executioner with three wickets for 27. Lameck Onyango (2/18), Nehemiah Odhiambo (2/22) and Elijah Otieno (2/16) were the other wicket takers. In reply, Swamibapa were home and dry, 126 with nine wickets and 26 balls in hand. Naman Top scored for the side (59 not out). Alex Obanda (10 off 11 balls) opened batting with Saumil and the duo put on an opening partnership of 17 that was broken when Obanda was clean bowled by Peter Koech (1/20). At Peponi School, Stray Lions (183 for 7 in 20 overs) mauled Cutch Leva (80 for 9 in 20 overs) by 103 runs. Kanbis (105 for 4 in 16.2 overs) beat Kongonis (104 all out in 19.3 overs) by six wickets. There appears to be trouble at the Sikh Union Club as their players boycotted their weekend fixtures.

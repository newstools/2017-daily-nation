The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) has resumed supplying relief food and other operations in Baringo after security was beefed up in volatile areas in the county. On Tuesday, KRCS secretary-general Abbas Gullet said the organisation had been assured of the safety of its workers after youths had blocked its trucks and stolen relief food in Kambi Samaki, Baringo North on February 24. “We have resumed our operations and humanitarian aid in Baringo after we were assured of our security. We urge leaders from this region to inform the locals that Red Cross is non-partisan and only offers assistance to people in dire need,” Mr Gullet said an emergency response and peace initiative forum at the Kenya School of Government in Kabarnet. Mr Gullet said cattle rustling was getting out of hand in the North Rift. “Leaders from the affected counties especially Baringo should question themselves because I am very sure they know the reasons behind the perennial problems. Even the police in the area are tired chasing after rustlers and even some of them might have decided to be part of the cartel,” the secretary-general said. He said he had expected the attacks in Baringo after two leaders from Tiaty were killed in cold blood at a night club in Marigat. “I had expected the chaos to erupt after the killings of an MCA (Member of County Assembly) and a parliamentary aspirant and immediately I sent three ambulances to patrol the area just in case of an emergency. True to my word, attacks started in Baringo North and South sub-counties,” he said. Last week, the KRCS suspended its operations in Baringo after the attack in Kambi Samaki. In the incident, which took place 12km from Marigat town centre, residents blocked a convoy of seven KRCS vehicles carrying 96.8 metric tons of relief food meant for Kapedo and Lomelo in Turkana and forced it to go back to Marigat.

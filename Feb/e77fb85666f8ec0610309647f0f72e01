A carpenter has been charged with threatening to kill KTN news anchor Joy Doreen Biira. The man allegedly threatened to kill Ms Biira if her colleague, who was last month charged with stealing her vehicle, is not released from jail. Last month, KTN Editor Aaron Ochieng was charged with stealing Ms Biiraâ€™s Mercedes Benz valued worth Sh2.8 million. Lawrence Joel Nyamao, alias Kepha Omanga Boundo, denied two counts of threatening to kill Ms Biira and sending her an abusive text message. He allegedly committed the offence on January 17. Mr Nyamao appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Francis Andayi. The accused was released on Sh300,000 cash bail. The case will be heard on March 23.   News anchor Joy Doreen Biira's Mercedes Benz was recovered in Kisumu on Friday.

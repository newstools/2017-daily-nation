Deputy President William Ruto on Monday returned to clash-hit Kerio Valley where commissioned an integrated police reservists programme to tame insecurity in the region. Mr Ruto, who was accompanied by Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, addressed a closed-door security meeting at Chesongoch Sisters' Convent before commissioning 230 police reservists. The reservists were issued firearms and uniforms at Chesongoch Catholic Church. None of politicians who were present attended the closed-door security meeting at the convent attended by the Deputy President with top security chiefs. Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen and former MP Linah Kilimo were not even allowed to attend the meeting. After the meeting, Mr Ruto addressed residents who had gathered outside the church.   According to the DP, the reservists will be remunerated and would be trained to work with the National Police Service. The DP said the volatile Kerio Valley would be under one police command, and the commander will be answerable to the highest authorities. He said the command will have access to a military chopper whenever required for rapid police response and the region will have an additional armoured personnel carrier. Mr Ruto was in Kerio Valley on Friday during which bandits shot in the air in an attempt to disrupt the meeting. The Deputy President also toured parts of Baringo where said an operation to flush out bandits has been launched.   Deputy President's peace rally disrupted as gunshots rock Bartabwa, Baringo.

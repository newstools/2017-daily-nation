Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has listed 12 witnesses in a case where former Nyeri County Executive Member for Agriculture and a Chief Officer are charged with corruption and abuse of office. Shadrack Mubea and Chief Officer David Nyaga are jointly charged with illegally awarding a tender of Sh30,082,000 to a firm named Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) Enterprises during financial year 2014/15. The contract was dated July 14, 2014. The prosecution witnesses are Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri’s chief advisor Wambui Kimathi who was the Nyeri County Secretary between 2013 and 2015 and JKUAT officials. HEARING POSTPONED The hearing, which was scheduled for February 28, has been postponed to May 22 after the accused persons’ lawyer Mr Njuguna Kimani said he could not cross-examine four witnesses as this required a lot of time. Mr Mubea and Mr Nyaga are accused of irregularly awarding JKUAT Enterprises a tender worth Sh30.8 million to conduct audits and review coffee societies in the county. They have since denied any involvement in corruption and abuse of office and have been released on a Sh5 million bond with a similar surety. The case will be heard on May 22, 23 and 29.   The two allegedly awarded a Sh30 million inflated contract to JKUAT Enterprises Limited.

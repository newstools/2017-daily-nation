Five medical interns from Somalia were arrested on Wednesday in Meru and handed over to the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit for being in the country illegally. They were arrested in Makutano following a tip-off from the public, North Imenti police boss Sammy Kosgey said. The suspects, who are from Somali International University in Mogadishu, are said to have arrived in the country late last year for an internship programme at Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital. But Meru County Health Chief Officer James Gitonga said he was not aware of any arrests, saying internship placements are handled by the national government. “We had 15 medical interns, but they are not with us anymore since they joined the doctor’s strike,” Dr Gitonga said by phone from Nairobi. In September last year, Meru health executive William Muraah said five medical interns from Somali International University would undergo training at the hospital in a skills support programme. Dr Muraah, who had attended the university’s graduation, said 14 other medical doctors will undertake their internships at Kenyatta National Hospital and in Uganda. “We will be receiving the Somali medical interns in Meru by early October. The programme will see our consultants go to Somalia for technical support,” Dr Muraah said then. The initiative, he said, was part of East Africa’s effort to grow the professional capacity of graduates from the Somalia university. Somali International has partnered with the University of Nairobi, Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology and Gulu University in Uganda for the training.

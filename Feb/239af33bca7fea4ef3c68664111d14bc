Sleep is one of the best ways to maintain the health and glow of the skin. Aptly named, beauty sleep is restorative. During sleep, skin cells are renewed and waste disposal from the skin is carried out. The skin regenerates as the rest of the body rests. This is the best time to carry out skin care regimens because the skin repairs itself at night. Do not neglect to clean and treat your skin at night, or whenever you are sleeping or at rest. Here is a guideline of how to make the most of your beauty sleep every evening: • Unwind by taking a refreshing warm bath or shower. If possible, incorporate some aromatherapy in your bath. • Prepare a subtly conducive sleeping area. A dark and quiet room is best. Ensure that your bed is clean and comfortable. • Change your pillowcase frequently to prevent dirt and grease transfer to your face. • Carry out face and body exfoliation before you sleep. This will help the skin to regenerate itself effectively. • Use rich oils and creams at night to restore what the day takes away. • Do not apply heavy eye-cream close to your eyes at night. • Avoid sleeping on your eyes or on one side of the face to prevent premature wrinkling. It is best to sleep facing upwards. • Use light blocking eye pads to induce total darkness for better quality sleep. • Remove all your make up before sleeping. Keep a packet of facial wipes at your bedside to use whenever you are too tired to carry out a proper cleansing routine. • Use a satin pillowcase to lessen the chances of creasing your face.

A woman who on Monday confessed to having knifed her husband’s manhood has denied the charge. Ms Angel Mutuku, in her mid-20s, who was to be sentenced Thursday, requested the charge be read to her again. She pleaded not guilty to assault. Mr Stephen Ochieng Oyuga is admitted to Bomu Medical Centre. The statement at Changamwe Police Station says Mutuku slapped her husband on the back at 5.30am accusing him of sleeping for too long. Mr Oyuga slapped her back “for awaking him roughly”. The two fought and he pushed her to the ground. Ms Mutuku allegedly stood up and fetched a small knife from the kitchen which she used to cut her husband’s manhood. The court heard that Mr Oyuga wants to forgive his wife. The case will be mentioned on March 1.

Alliance High School Principal David Kariuki has quit following allegations of bullying at the school that are said to have left scores of students injured. The bullying was said to have been carried out by prefects and senior students for a long time yet the principal had not taken action. Parents raised the alarm with the Ministry of Education early this year leading to an investigation. The Teachers Service Commission has since accepted the request of Mr Kariuki to retire early before he turns 60. The Ministry carried out the investigations in January and February and talked to several students and teachers. The school is a top performer in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examinations. Last year, it had 14 As against 207 As in 2015. On Monday, Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said at Utawala Academy in Nairobi that investigations were underway into allegations of bullying of Form One student in secondary schools. It has been going on for a long time and is not related to last year’s drop in Form Four examinations scores, a source at the ministry said. JOURNALISTS LOCKED OUT A meeting is planned at Alliance on Saturday when students return from half term break. The meeting, said to be for old boys, want changes made in the best interest of students, said a source at the school. Journalists, including those from the Nation, were locked out of a meeting at the school on Tuesday before being asked to leave. Efforts to speak to Board of Management members were futile. Mr Kariuki later confirmed he retired early to pursue other interests. On Tuesday, Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary General Wilson Sossion protested the decision to kick out Mr Kariuki, saying it was being done on flimsy grounds. “It is unfair to kick our Mr Kariuki while other principals are being promoted. The Ministry of Education is behind the decision,” said Mr Sossion. Additional reporting by Agewa Magut and Karen Muriuki

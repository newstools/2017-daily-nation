Wiper on Wednesday said it was not worried by ODM s move to field a candidate against deputy party leader Farah Maalim in Garissa.The race to remove National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale (Jubilee) from the Garissa Town seat has been complicated by Raila Odinga s move to endorse Mr Nassir Dolal for the seat two weeks ago. On Wednesday, Mr Maalim said he was not shaken by the move and it will, in fact, embolden his bid for the seat. We have a powerful culture of democracy even in our coalition, Mr Maalim, a former National Assembly Deputy Speaker, said of Mr Dolal s entry in the race. But, rest assured, this time round they will lose. MUSYOKA OPTIMISTICWiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was even more optimistic, stating: We are not worried about Garissa. One, Mr Maalim campaigned for Mr Dolal and there are clan dynamics (that work in our favour). Two, the race is about to remove one Duale and we are going to accomplish it. The two leaders spoke at their office in Nairobi when they signed a coalition agreement with Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana s Muungano Party.

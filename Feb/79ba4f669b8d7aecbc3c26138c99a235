For a country starved of good news, there is some fascinating development in the tourism sector. It is comes at a time when the industry has been struggling for revival, having been deeply depressed by the threat of terrorism, violence and general insecurity. Coastal tourism, especially, has been down, but the latest international recognition is a signal of things to come. Besides a Nairobi hotel voted the best in the country, TripAdvisor has also listed five coastal hotels among the top 10. These ratings are taken seriously by tourists, and are a good pointer that the industry is up to something good that should contribute significantly to the sector’s revival. The challenge is to sustain the qualities rekindling our coastal tourism’s attractiveness despite numerous challenges. Of course, industry players are only too aware that with the elections approaching, bookings could be cancelled and visitor arrivals will drop due to the fear of violence during electioneering. But the onus is on the authorities, the electoral commission and security agencies to do all they can to ensure that the gains from tourism are not wiped out during and after the poll. Indeed, the elections will put a further strain on a country in the grip of a severe drought and the threat of hunger and starvation. The cheer from tourism could not have come at a better time and calls for greater efforts to sustain it.

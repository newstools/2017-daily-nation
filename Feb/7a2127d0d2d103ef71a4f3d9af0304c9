A man was sentenced to 30 years in jail for defiling his daughter. On Friday, Resident Magistrate Paul Mutai heard that the father of the 15-year-old girl carried out the act between July 16 and July 17 last year at his home in Kwale County. "This act is a pathetic case of sexual act between father and daughter," Mr Mutai said. He has been in custody since his arrest on August 6 last year after the court declined to grant him bail, arguing he posed a threat to the complainant and her mother. Sophy Wanjala, an investigation officer and a witness, argued against a bail request, saying the complainant and her mother feared for their lives. However, the father has maintained his innocence. The Form One girl said: "I was alone at home and my father opened the door unexpectedly and did the act." In his defence, the accused said he is the sole bread winner and that sentencing him would affect the well-being of his family. The magistrate made his ruling after evidence given by four witnesses. The man has 14 days to appeal.

Four ODM leaders in Kisumu have alleged that their lives are in danger because of a dispute about the ongoing voter mobilisation campaign and their stand on local politics. Kisumu Senator Anyang’ Nyong’o, Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga, Nyando MP Fred Outa and former Muhoroni MP Ayiecho Olweny linked the threats to Governor Jack Ranguma’s campaign team. They accused the group, called Friends of Ranguma, of being behind the intimidation. Prof Nyong’o also claimed there are smear campaigns against him on social media. “In the past few days you may have noticed some damaging information circulating in the social media that I was dead. I am not taking this lightly,” Prof Nyong’o told journalists at a media briefing Wednesday. He said he will record a statement with the police over threats to his life. Ms Odinga, Prof Olweny and Mr Outa also claimed they have been threatened. 'EASY TARGET' Ms Odinga said she was not worried about the intimidation targeting her. Mr Outa said: “I am a man and I don’t fear anybody. We all have a right to vie for any position in this county.” Prof Olweny caused laughter when he said he has information the group has declared him an easy target. The leaders also accused Mr Ranguma of sabotaging the ongoing voter registration in the county. But Mr Ranguma dismissed the allegations, saying the leaders were just playing diversionary politics. “Their allegations are unnecessary diversion. We are at a critical stage in the voter mobilisation process. “Every minute counts for our journey to win the presidential elections and ensure Raila Odinga becomes the next President. "Rather than wasting time fighting small egocentric battles related to local politics, we must unite and focus our attention on mopping up every potential voter to register before the February 14 deadline,” he said.

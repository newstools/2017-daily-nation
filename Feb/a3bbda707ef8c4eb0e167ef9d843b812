A showdown is looming over over the suspension of holiday learning for teachers. Education Cabinet Secretary (CS) Fred Matiang’i said the decision to suspend the programme will not be reviewed despite protests from teachers. “Someone takes a week during April, August and December in university then we refer to it as an academic year. That cannot work. You need prayers,” said Dr Matiang’i. Teachers have vowed to reject education reforms that are seeking to prevent them from pursuing holiday degree studies. Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary General Wilson Sossion said the threat will not work.

LIMITED IN DURATION However, Dr Matiang’i said the programme was too limited in duration to provide the required hours for provision of quality higher education and the intellectual rigor that defines quality university programmes. “We will convert this programme into part time programmes to ensure that the students secure the knowledge and competencies that define quality higher education useful to the students and the society at large,” said the CS. The audit released last month revealed that the quality holiday learning offered to teachers by many universities was wanting. Commission for University Education is already working with the concerned institutions to convert the courses into quality part-time programmes with sufficient opportunities for research and contact between the learners and their lecturers. Dr Matiang’i made the remarks during the 15th Universities Education Exhibition and Discourse, at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa on Tuesday.

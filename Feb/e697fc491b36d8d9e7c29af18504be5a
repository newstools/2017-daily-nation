Kenya’s team to the IAAF World Cross Country Championships to be held on March 26, in Kampala, has been named. No doubt, this is the strongest squad Kenyans could have hoped for, and Athletics Kenya must be congratulated for organising a successful national championship. As the team goes into residential training on Wednesday, let’s give them all the support they need to lift the overall title in Kampala and prove to the world that Kenya remains the best nation in distance running. It was disturbing, however, that neither Sports Cabinet Secretary Hassan Wario nor any of his senior ministry officials were at the championships to show solidarity with our athletes. Coming hot on the heels of last year’s Rio Olympic Games scandal in which some top officials are being investigated for financial impropriety, the snub has left a bitter taste in the mouths of athletes, officials and fans. It also begs the question as to how seriously the ministry takes sports, which, ironically, is its core function. However, Athletics Kenya must not be distracted by such recalcitrance and must keep their eyes on the prize by preparing the team well. Supporters should also prepare to invade Kampala in their bus loads to cheer as our athletes continue conquering the world!

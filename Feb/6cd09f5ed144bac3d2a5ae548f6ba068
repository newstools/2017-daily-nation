The life of a 21-year-old expectant woman in Mombasa is in danger after a foetus died in her womb. Salma Hussein is writhing in pain at a private hospital in Mikindani. There are no medical services in public facilities in the county and the hospital she is in does not have facilities to conduct surgery to remove the foetus. According to the doctor in charge, Dr Robin Mwenda, the mother arrived at the hospital on Sunday with an infection, and she was treated and discharged. However in the evening, Ms Hussein’s husband Ericko Outa said his wife was in pain and had to be taken to the private hospital on Monday morning. “On Sunday, my wife was sick but the baby was okay because she confirmed the baby was kicking,” Mr Outa recalled. “But after taking the medicines, that is on Monday morning, she did not feel the baby kicking, and her health had started deteriorating. “After a scan, it was revealed that my child had died.” He said they were referred to Coast General Provincial Hospital but the guards turned them away due to the doctors’ strike. Dr Mwenda said the mother’s health was at risk.

Home pro Greg Snow moved four shots ahead from his closest challenger after firing two under par 69 in the second round of the Race to 2017 Kenya Open series at Muthaiga Golf Club on Thursday.He starts Saturday s third and final round with a four shots advantage from Windsor Golf Hotel and Country Club s David Opati, who shot one under par 70 to move to second place on 141. Nakuru s Richard Ainley dropped to third place after a 73 in the second round. My iron play and off the tee is fine. I am hitting it pretty good, though my putter is still a bit bad considering the chances I gave myself. I feel if I can hole a few more putts there is a low one out there, said Snow, who had a total of five birdies for the day, though he dropped a couple of shots also. Snow brought his two-day total to five under par 137 and a chance for a first victory in the local scene since March last year. Also moving up was Coast-based Abdul Sihag, who shot one under par 70 for 143, just a shot better than Kopan Timbe who also fired one under par for a total of 144. Long-hitting Dismas Indiza dropped to joint sixth with Thika Sports Club s Simon Ngige. Indiza carded three over par 74 and Ngige fired two over par 73.

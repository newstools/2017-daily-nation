Kenya Sevens will for the second consecutive time play in the Challenge Trophy after they twice surrendered their leads, losing to England and South Africa 19-12 and 14-7 respectively in the Sydney Sevens on Saturday. Their last Pool A duel against Japan at 11.51am on Saturday will not be of much significance. Sloppy defending saw Kenya squander a 12-0 lead to go down to the Britons in their opening match at dawn after a thrilling battle. Eden Agero scored off a quick tap penalty before converting for a 7-0 lead. A pulsating counter ruck on Dan Norton after restart would see Collins Injera put through Billy Odhiambo to score. Agero failed to convert for a 12-0 lead. The second half belonged to England where Richard De Carpentier scored a brace of tries as McConnochieâ€™s last gasp try sealed the victory. Kenya and South Africa proved a close battle where the Kenyans seemed to have a edge over the Dubai and Wellington Sevens champions in the physical contests in addition to good defending. Injera once again was the playmaker when he found Augustine Lugonzo in place before the Homeboyz player paced down to score. Agero converted for 7-0 lead at the break. Agero was to be sin-binned mid second half and the South Africans took advantage of their numbers to score through their high-flying Seabelo Senatla after being played in by impact sub Rosco Speckman. Justin Geguld converted to level the proceedings. Senalta would land his brace a minute later as Geguld converted for Boks victory. South Africa and England beat Japan 32-0 and 26-0 respectively to book their place in main Cup quarterfinals.

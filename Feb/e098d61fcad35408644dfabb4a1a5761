The European Union has said it does not plan to interfere with Kenya's elections but only wants to ensure they are conducted fairly. Speaking in Kisumu, Bruno Pozzi, the blocâ€™s deputy head of delegation in Kenya, said money has been set aside to facilitate the electoral process. "Our agenda is to ensure free, fair and credible polls organised by Kenyans for Kenyans," Mr Pozzi said at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission's office in Kisumu. He spoke after leading a meeting of EU delegates and local leaders to discuss the country's election preparedness. The role of the EU and other foreign actors in this year's General Election was questioned by President Uhuru Kenyatta in his Jamhuri Day address. He claimed that foreign agencies were conspiring to interfere in the polls under the guise of providing aid to organisations conducting civic education. "In the United States, following the last election, much has been said about potential foreign interference with the electoral process. "We are also going into elections next year. There is already money coming into Kenya from abroad under the guise of supporting good governance or civic education," President Kenyatta said then.

George Oyugi, the IEBC's regional elections coordinator in Central Nyanza, said voter registration was also discussed in the meeting. "We also discussed our proposed strategies for voter registration and the 2017 General Election," Mr Oyugi said. The EU delegation later visited County Commissioner Maalim Mohamed and Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga. The delegation is meeting representatives of some political parties in Kisumu.

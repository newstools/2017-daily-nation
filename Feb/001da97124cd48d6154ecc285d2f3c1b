Deputy President William Ruto has directed chiefs to process national identity cards for Coast residents and ensure they register as voters before the February 14 deadline. The number of unregistered residents is estimated to be 1.5 million. He spoke in Kilifi County on the first day of his campaign to mobilise voter registration. Mr Ruto addressed rallies at Watamu, Gede, Vipingo, Tezo and Finika Grounds. He was accompanied by Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and a host of Jubilee aspirants for various seats. The deputy president asked Coast residents to reject the opposition “which has nothing to offer”. He said the government had built 220 kilometres of tarmac roads in Kilifi in the last four years. “We have tarmacked Kaloleni-Mavueni road, Mariakani-Bamba road and are now building the 120-kilometre Malindi-Sala Gate road,” he said. Mr Ruto added that Sh800 million has been given to Malindi and Kilifi hospitals and Sh50 million used to expand Mtwapa hospital. He said the opposition had sensed defeat “and that is why its leaders are lamenting and making unfounded claims of plans to rig the August election”. The DP added that the politics of lies, division, propaganda and tribalism were the order of the day among opposition leaders. Addressing a leaders’ meeting and rally in Watamu, Mr Ruto said opposition leaders had failed to question how billions of shillings released to county governments since 2013 had been used. Others at the meetings were MPs Gideon Mungaro (Kilifi North), Mr Mustapha Iddi (Kilifi South), Ms Zeinab Chidzuga (Kwale Woman Representative), Ms Emma Mbura (Nominated), Mr Harry Kombe (Magarini) and Mr Peter Shehe (Ganze), among others.

Farmers in Tana River County are counting huge loses after their animals died mysteriously after feeding on maize stalks. The farmers from Wayu Duka village said they have lost more than 30 cows worth over a million shillings to an unknown disease. Led by Mr Osman Iddi, they said the animals fed on maize stalk residue fields for about three days, thereafter, started becoming weak and dehydrated. "Around 10 cows which survived have remained weak and dehydrated and are yet to move out to graze on their own. "All cows which died had grazed on the maize stalk residue fields and they all showed [the] same symptoms. "We suspect they must have eaten some poisonous grass known to sprout during [the] dry season," Mr Iddi said. He said when some of the cows that survived were slaughtered, their blood had turned white, and a few others produced milk laced with blood. However, he added that some residents who were reported to have consumed the meat did not show any signs of illness. Veterinary officers from Hola town collected tissue samples for laboratory analysis. The county director of Veterinary Service, Dr Anthony Kinywa, told Nation that the samples will be assessed at the Government Chemist of Kenya. "We suspected it could be poison from human or natural growing plants but we have to do laboratory examinations to establish the real issue," Dr Kinywa said on phone. He cautioned farmers to be on the lookout, saying animals can easily graze on poisonous plants, owing to depleted pasture due to drought.

Two Kenyan clubs – Tusker and Ulinzi Stars – are seeking to advance in Confederation of African Football (Caf) competitions. True, the two teams face an uphill task but they have a responsibility to do the country proud as its representatives in the continental championship. Ulinzi Stars host Libyan club Al Hilal Benghazi in the Caf Confederation Cup on Saturday afternoon at the Safaricom Stadium Kasarani. The soldiers lost the first leg 1-0 last week and fans at home are hoping that the team will overturn the deficit now that they will be enjoying home ground advantage. On the other hand, Kenyan champions Tusker will play away to Mauritian side AS Port-Louis 2000 in the Caf Champions League on Saturday after being held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of their first-round match. Both teams have their work cut out and will need to be at their best to advance to the next round of the two competitions. Save for Gor Mahia, the winners of the Nelson Mandela Cup in 1987, no any other Kenyan club has tasted continental glory and the onus will be on the two clubs to end the trophy drought and secure the results they need to progress to the next stage. They can make history, and Kenyans expect them to. We wish them the best.

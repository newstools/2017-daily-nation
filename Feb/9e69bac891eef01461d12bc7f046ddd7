Four young men have been found strangled and dumped in a vehicle at a garage in Gitaru, Kikuyu, Kiambu County. Police say the vehicle, which was parked at the garage on Wednesday morning, spent the whole day there without mechanics inspecting its cargo. The driver who parked it, locals say, left immediately, without speaking to anyone. HEAD INJURIES At around 7pm, curious mechanics operating at the garage peeped through the windows of the Toyota Succeed, which resembles a Probox, only to find the bodies. "The driver parked the car and left without talking to anyone," Kikuyu police chief Joseph Ongaya to the Nation on Thursday. "The mechanics did not see anything usual, until in the evening when they decided to check on it after realising that it (the vehicle) had been at their place of work for so long." The bodies, Ongaya said, had head injuries that they suspected were caused by blunt objects. NO IDs No identity documents were found on the corpses, which have been taken to City Mortuary in Nairobi. Police suspect the four may have been murdered elsewhere and the bodies ferried to the area. Mr Ongaya said police were hunting for the driver who abandoned the vehicle. Also wanted is the owner of the vehicle, whose identity police are likely to get from the Kenya Revenue Authority.  More follows.

The Law Society of Kenya has nominated two lawyers to be part of the panel mediating the doctors' strike. President Isaac Okero said John Morris Ohaga and Njeri Kariuki are experienced in mediation and will help end the impasse between doctors and the government. "It is the commitment to seek a substantive resolution as expressed by the parties through their counsel appearing before the Court of Appeal that will form the best foundation for a solution to the crisis," Mr Okero said. Other members of the team are Kagwiria Mbogori, chairperson of Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), and James Mang'erere, a member of KNCHR. The panel, which will be co-chaired by Ms Mbogori and Mr Ohaga, has already begun its task. This will be another stab at ending the strike after the Wednesday release of Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials, who were locked up at various prisons in Nairobi on Monday for contempt of court. They were jailed after calling a nationwide strike against the orders of the Employment and Labour Relations Court. They were freed after a night in jail so they can continue with negotiations. The strike entered its 73rd day Thursday.

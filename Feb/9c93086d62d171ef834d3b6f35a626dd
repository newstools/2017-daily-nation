WASHINGTON A month into Donald Trump's presidency, The Washington Post has unveiled a new slogan: 'Democracy Dies in Darkness.' It appeared for the first time across the top of the storied daily newspaper's website on Friday, and will likely be added to the print version at some point in the future. "This is actually something we've said internally for a long time in speaking about our mission," Post spokeswoman Kristine Coratti Kelly told AFP in an email. "We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year." The phrase is often used by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward, most famous for his 1970s reporting that uncovered the Watergate scandal during Richard Nixon's presidency. Many American newspapers including The Washington Post have enjoyed a surge in subscriptions and clicks since the election of Trump, a billionaire real estate developer who has a combative relationship with journalists. He frequently accuses news outlets of being biased against him and recently took to Twitter - his preferred communication platform - to denounce the "FAKE NEWS media" as "the enemy of the American People." More than 98.4 million users visited the Post's website in January, a 41 percent increase over the same period last year, the newspaper said. The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, founder of the online shopping giant Amazon.

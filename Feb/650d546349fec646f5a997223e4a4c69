The national examiner says past performance cannot be a reason for doubting the veracity of the 2016 Standard Eight exam results. While responding to a case filed by parents in Mombasa, the Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) on Tuesday argued that every year has its exams and that students' competitiveness varies each year. EXAM SCRIPTS Knec further noted that the strict regime under which the examinations were conducted in 2016 was bound to have an effect on the results. Through an affidavit of Mr Wilson Chelimo, an acting deputy director responsible for examination management, Knec also opposed a request by parents of Nyali Primary School and Kindergarten to access exam scripts. Mr Chelimo said the Education Act does not entitle candidates to have access to their scripts once marked. The parents are challenging last year Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination results of their children. KNEC DEFENCE The 89 parents are seeking a mandatory injunction compelling Knec to avail the examination scripts of the children who sat KCPE tests last year at the institution. Mr Chelimo said the integrity of last year's exams is confirmed by the fact that out of the 942,021 candidates who wrote them, only 0.1 percent raised queries. The answer sheets from the school, he said, were objectively, professionally marked and scores awarded to candidates “All anomalies raised as queries in the school’s letter were occasioned by the commission or omission of the candidates concerned, the concerns were investigated and addressed appropriately,” said Mr Chelimo. MACHINE The official further said that if the court was to order Knec to avail the examination scripts of children who sat KCPE last year at the school for verification, the order would comprise the integrity of the examination and the process of examining candidates. He said the Optical Mark Reader machine (equipment used to mark multiple choices examination) was not interfered with during the marking process nor was the integrity of exams tallying process compromised. “The alleged mistakes the petitioners assume to have been committed by the ORM were actually committed by the candidates themselves and such mistakes could still be corrected manually,” said Mr Chelimo. RIGHTS He said the examination body has not violated the right of candidates to free and compulsory basic education as it (right) does not insinuate that candidates must ‘freely’ pass examinations. “The setting and marking of examinations for candidates is done under a structured legal system which also ensures that confidentiality is associated with that right,” said Mr Chelimo. The parents want scripts provided for checking to ensure validity, reliability and accuracy of allocation of marks. PETITION They also want verification and adjudication of the the marks done. According to the petitioners, the marks awarded to their children do not reflect their ability or the school's general performance over the years. “The petitioners contend that for transparency and accountability in the process, verification and adjudication of captured marks be done,” read the petition by the parents filed by lawyer Macmillan Jengo. CHECKING The parents argue that it is always important to do a physical manual checking of the works of the optical machine as it springs out errors based on the shade marked by the candidate. The parents are also seeking a declaration that their children rights under the Constitution have been violated by the examination body. Justice Eric Ogolla fixed the case for mention on March 21 for highlighting of submissions.        Examination council ordered to file response within seven days .

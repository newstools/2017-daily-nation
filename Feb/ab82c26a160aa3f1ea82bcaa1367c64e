ODM has called a national delegates conference to endorse Raila Odinga as the party's presidential candidate. The summit at Kasarani Stadium on March 9 and 10 will end a series of endorsements by four parties in the National Super Alliance (Nasa), which started in 2016. The announcement by ODM director of elections Junet Mohamed has jolted some coalition members, who question the timing of the move. “On February 7, the ODM central management committee resolved that since our presidential candidate Raila Odinga was endorsed by NEC and the National Governing Council at Bomas of Kenya, we will hold a National Delegates Conference to endorse him as flagbearer,” he said yesterday. Other than Wiper, Amani National Congress and Ford-Kenya, Mr Mohamed said ODM was expecting representatives from “sister parties” from the region, such as Tanzania’s CCM, South Africa’s ANC and Zimbabwe’s MDC. The ruling Jubilee has a pact with the Chinese Communist party. Coming at a time Nasa is engaged in a delicate exercise of picking who among Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang’ula should fly the alliance’s presidential flag, the event could send the wrong signal within the coalition that ODM could be readying to go it alone in the August elections.

Kenya’s preparedness to host the 2018 African Nations Championships is in serious doubt. Confederation of Africa Football (Caf) officials visited the country this week and were not impressed with what has been done. Consequently, they have given Kenya till October to complete works on the five venues – Kasarani, Nyayo National Stadium, Kinoru Stadium in Meru, Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos and Kipchoge Keino stadium in Eldoret. That is a tight deadline given that the competition begins on January 11, 2018. The Caf has been supportive of Kenya, with its vice-president Suketu Patel saying they currently have no plan B, a vote of confidence that the country cannot afford to squander. But Sports minister Hassan Wario’s contention that they are waiting for the outcome of Caf inspection to get the guidelines on what to do next reflects a state of cluelessness. Kenya knew way back in 2014 that it would host the 2018 edition, hence was aware of what it takes to do so. It will be embarrassing if the tournament is moved from Kenya due to poor preparation. This is possible, considering that a similar action was taken in 1996 when the Africa Cup of Nations tourney was moved from Kenya to South Africa for that very reason. Kenya’s image is at risk and the government must do everything possible to expedite the renovations.

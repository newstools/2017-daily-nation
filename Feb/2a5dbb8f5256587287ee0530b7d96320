Five inmates made a daring escape on Friday after they jumped from a vehicle that was transporting them to the Kangundo Law Courts. A sixth prisoner was shot dead as he tried to escape. The vehicle was transporting 36 remandees, including eight charged with capital offences, from Machakos Prison. They broke free in Syanthi, on the Machakos-Kangundo road. The prisoners are said to have taken advantage of a rough stretch on the road that is under construction to break free when the vehicle slowed down. “I am told they pushed the warden and jumped out. One was shot in the process and the five are still at large,” said outgoing Machakos prison boss Esther Solomon. Police are searching for the escapees in Kangundo town and its environs.

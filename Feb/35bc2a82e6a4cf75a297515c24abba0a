A police officer was on Saturday evening hacked to death at Mangala in Makueni County, in the latest incident related to the harvesting and sale of sand. Mr Kasyoka Kimuya was based in Tetu sub-county, Nyeri County. Confirming the incident, Mukaa deputy county commissioner Nyamawi Chaka said that the officer was slain by suspected youth armed with machetes at Mangala trading centre. He said that the attack was related to the officer's firm stand against sand harvesting in Mukaa. "This must have been a revenge attack because the two groups have been feuding over sand harvesting and trade for many years," he said. He cautioned residents against taking the law into their own hands. Kimuya's body was taken to Kilungu mortuary for postmortem as police have started investigations. Conflicts over sand harvesting have ensued, particularly after the county put laws regulating sand harvesting at rivers.

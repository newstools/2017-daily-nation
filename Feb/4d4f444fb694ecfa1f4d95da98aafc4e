Just a day after it resumed from a two-month recess, the county assembly of Nakuru on Wednesday failed to raise a quorum, forcing it to delay its morning session by one and a half hours. Speaker Susan Wakarura Kihika had Tuesday pleaded with members to carefully balance between the House duties and other callings at the grassroots, which she acknowledged were equally important for their political careers, as campaigns for the August elections beckon. The Wednesday morning session was to start at 9.30am but it was not until 11 am that the House was able to convene, even though it had still not raised the required quorum. Acting Speaker Stephen Karanja Kiarie (Kihingo Ward) arrived in the House at 11.02am but only four MCAs out of 74 were present. Those present were Mr Joseph Ngugi Muigai (Molo), Mr Peter Nderitu Mwangi (Bahati), Ms Agnes Jerotich Salimu (Mariashoni) and Mr Joshua Wilson Muriithi (nominated). The Acting Speaker ordered the assembly orderlies to ring the bell for more than 10 minutes to alert the MCAs who were outside the House, before the quorum was raised and the House proceeded with its business.

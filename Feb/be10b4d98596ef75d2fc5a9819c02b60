Every administration has had a ghost to exorcise in the form of a gigantic fraud. The Kanu leadership under retired President Moi suffered the ignominy of the Goldenberg scandal. Narc, under retired President Mwai Kibaki, it was the Anglo Leasing scam. Under Jubilee, the multi-million looting of the National Youth Service remains a poster signature of its share of shame. Though it is commonly reported that NYS lost Sh791 million, subsequent evidence has indicated that is in the range of Sh1.6 billion. Indeed, when the full details unfold, the figure could be astronomical. Our concern now is an attempt to kill and bury investigations by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Reports indicate that shadowy characters are trying to sabotage the investigations. The PAC has been infiltrated and members frustrate report writing by absenting themselves to force adjournments and possibly drag the process until the House dissolves in June at the end of its term and the case collapses. Another strategy is to dilute the content and extricate influential suspects. PAC chairman Nicolas Gumbo must resist these machinations, and where necessary, seek the intervention of the House Speaker to conclude the report expeditiously and scrupulously. The NYS swindle and those before it must be fully unearthed and the culprits punished.

Murang’a County Commissioner John Elungata has promised to give Sh100 to every resident who registers as a voter. Mr Elungata said it is a way of motivating people to enlist so that the electoral agency can meet its target. The money, he said, was for fare. He explained that he came up with the idea together with Gitugi MCA Duncan Njuguna after locals complained of not willing to enlist as voters because the Independent Electoral and Boundaries (IEBC) centres were far, and they did not have bus fare. "I understand people are failing to register as voters citing lack of money for transport. I will give Sh100 to anybody who registers," he said during his address to residents in Gitugi, Mathioya constituency. "If you register, go to your chief and show him [the voters card] and ask for Sh100. He will give you and I will refund," he said. He noted that the number of people who had registered as voters was low. In Kigumo, parliamentary aspirant Macharia Ben has sponsored a two-day free medical camp where locals will be advised on the benefits of voting as they get attended to. Dr Ben urged them to maximise on the opportunity. At the same time, Sheikh Alhaji Bakari complained that Muslim youth are being victimised when they go to register as voters. Speaking at Mukuyu mosque in Murang’a town on Saturday during Maulid celebrations, he said it is unfair for some people to be discriminated based on their religious affiliation. The sheikh said all Kenyans should be treated fairly.

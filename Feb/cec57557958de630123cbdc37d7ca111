Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) president Sam Nyamweya has filed a case at the high court seeking orders to suspend the Kenyan Premier League club licensing rules and regulations introduced by the federation. Nyamweya, who filed the case under a certificate of urgency, is also seeking to have orders issued by the Sports Disputes Tribunal on the tiff between KPL and FKF be suspended pending determination of his case. The former football boss charges Sports Disputes Tribunal, the FKF president Nick Mwendwa and Robert Muthomi for violating terms of the agreement between the federation and the league body over the running of the country’s top football league. According to Nyamweya, the officials have done so by agreeing to run the league. ADVERSE EFFECT In the suit filed at the Milimani High Court Nairobi,  Nyamweya argues that the violations will lead to severe wrangles which will adversely affect Kenyan football. “We may be banned from participating in football activities by Fifa and risk losing hosting rights of the Continental African Nations Championship (Chan) 2018 continental tournament,” Nyamweya said. The former FKF boss is also asking the court to restrain Mwendwa from discussing and interfering with the ownership, organisation, management and running of the KPL.   The wrangling can be traced to the last decade.

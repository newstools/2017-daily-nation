The government has began the inspection and commissioning of locomotives for the standard gauge railway (SGR), moving to indicate that the completion of the first phase will be on schedule. Speaking to journalists at State House, Spokesperson Manoah Esipisu said the first journey from Mombasa to Nairobi will start in June. "Testing, commissioning and inspection of these locomotives has already begun. Kenya remains on track to see the first SGR journey to Nairobi from Mombasa on June 1, 2017," Mr Esipisu said. Mr Esipisu said more locomotives and passenger coaches will be delivered later. The first batch of locomotives arrived at the Mombasa port on January 10. "Eight heavy haul freight locomotives, passenger locomotives as well as two shunting locomotives have been delivered. More deliveries are expected in the coming months," he added.

WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's first budget proposal includes a substantial $54 billion dollar increase in defence spending, with corresponding cuts in foreign assistance and other non-military spending. Highlighting what Trump has described as a "public safety and national security budget," the plan raises national defence spending - already the highest in the world - by almost 10 per cent, an official said on condition of anonymity. The proposal, which will be picked over by Congress, will have "a corresponding reduction in non-defence spending by 54 billion," the official said. "Most federal agencies will see a reduction as a result."

PALM BEACH The US Secret Service launched an investigation Friday, after an object was hurled at Donald Trump's motorcade as it travelled to his Florida resort. As Trump's motorcade was moving from the airport at West Palm Beach to his Mar-a-Lago home earlier Friday, an object appears to have been thrown at the convoy. "The Secret Service can confirm that an object appears to have been thrown at the motorcade this afternoon," an official said in a statement. "We are investigating at this time and don't have anything further." Trump's motorcade travel is often greeted by well-wishers and hecklers. In Palm Beach, Trump has received a mostly positive welcome, with fans lining the route with signs saying 'Welcome Home.'

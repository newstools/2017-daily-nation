A team comprising some of the biggest stars in the Kenyan Premier League will enjoy exposure at the highest level on Sunday night when they play English Premier League side Hull City. The trip is sponsored by the betting website SportPesa and is certainly an opportunity for the players to advertise their talents and possibly bag contracts to play abroad. However, the type of training they have received in the few days in which they have been in Hull city should offer pointers on the lessons to bring home. According to the players, they have received instruction on media relations and how to conduct themselves during press conferences. They have also attended finance management sessions. Athletes’ careers are quite short and they will generally be at the peak for about a decade. Planning for retirement is vital. Sport has helped many youth escape temptations such as drug abuse and a life in crime. Now that the industry has grown considerably in recent years, it would be prudent to organise teams along more professional lines. Football clubs, for example, would borrow a leaf from others by establishing youth academies. It has worked well in the United Kingdom and in African countries such as Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Egypt. The Kenyan players’ trip to the United Kingdom will only be useful if they apply at home some of the lessons they will pick up.

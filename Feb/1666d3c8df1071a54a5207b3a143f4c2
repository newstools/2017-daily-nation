Mathare United captain George Owino is upbeat his team will perform well in the forthcoming SportPesa Premier League season which kicks off on February 25. Owino, whose team lost dependable players during the off season, is has tipped Mathare to do do better compared to their seventh-place finish last term in the 16-team competition. “We have been in such (challenging) situations before and still performed. Don’t forget we are backed by an outstanding technical bench who have won titles before.” Owino, 36, who has been at the club for the past three seasons, explained. The defender was speaking Tuesday at a ceremony where the club’s shirt sponsors, mobile sports betting operator Betway Kenya, donated training equipment to the team at the Goan Institute grounds. The equipment included training bibs, cooler boxes, footballs, illuminated field markers and mineral water. “We recognise the potential of talented and rising players in this club. We’ve taken it upon ourselves to support them to achieve their dream,” said Betway Country Manager Wanja Gikonyo. Mathare have lost an array of stars during off season, the likes of Eric Johanna who has moved to Sweden and Robinson Kamura who joined AFC Leopards. Others who left are veteran forward Obadiah Ndege and Eric Mata. Mathare coach Francis Kimanzi has in the meantime signed custodian Levis Opiyo from Western Stima, midfielder Roy Okal from Ushuru, and promoted Ahmed Ahmad, Martin Ongori, David Owino and John Mwangi from the triumphant U-20 KPL side.   The outstanding coach each month will pocket Sh75,000, up from Sh50,000 awarded last term.

Does Mwamba, Nondescripts and Strathmore Leos still have hopes of making the Kenya Cup top six play-offs?That is the big question now as the three teams seek a breakthrough to the play-off vanguard on Saturday.Mwamba, who have a had a good run in the past matches, face Kenya Harlequin at the Railway Club while hosts Nondies play Nakuru in one of the double header at the Jamhuri Park showground.A battered Strathmore Leos, who have slumped to three consecutive losses, hope for retribution when they host leaders Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) in one of the double header at Jamhuri Park showground.Mwamba, who have four wins, a draw and five defeats for their tally of 26 points, are placed seventh, four points off the play-off cut. Nakuru are sixth with 30 points.Nondies are placed eighth with 15 points drawn from three wins and six losses while Strathmore, who 2013 finalists, are ninth on 11 points.Mwamba coach Kevin Bling Wambua is confident that Mwamba will finish in the top six to feature in the play-off for the first time since the knock-out play-offs were intruded in 2013. We still have a chance looking at some of the favourable matches we are remaining with, said Wambua, who has made two changes to the side that lost to Homeboyz 17-28 last Saturday.Wambua said injuries had brought inconsistencies to his team but he was glad that most of the players had recovered. We didn t have a good pre-season hence the many injuries but we have the momentum now, said Wambua.Mwamba will face Impala, Black Blad, Nondies, Strathmore and KCB in their quest for the play-offs. The first two teams after the normal league will automatically go into the semi-finals while the next four teams will engage in a play-off for a place in the semis.Paul Wahome is due to make his first team debut for Mwamba at lock where he replaces Steve Sikuta, who goes to the bench.Wambua, however, will be without his influential kicker Lavin Asego, who is away on personal commitments. George Mutuku takes his place. Strathmore Leos, who were hit hard at the beginning of the season when 22 players left the club, have been struggling through, having recorded only two wins against Nondies 43- 10 and Homeboyz 33-32.FIXTURES (All kick offs 4pm unless stated)Western Bulls v Impala Saracens (Kakamega High School)Mwamba v Quins (Railway Club)Mean Machine v Homeboyz (UoN)Blak Blad v Kabras Suga (Kenyatta University)Strathmore Leos v KCB (Jamhuri Park, 2pm)Nondescripts v Nakuru (Jamhuri Park) email print email print Blow to ODM party as its Kuria leader jumps ship.

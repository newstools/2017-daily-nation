The Kenya National Union of Teachers has said it will assess the agenda of all political parties before it decides on which one to endorse. Secretary-General Wilson Sossion said the union's decision will not be imposed on its members. "However, no member will be forced to comply with our decision. They will be allowed to make individual choices if they so wish. We will also back individual leaders regardless of their ethnic backgrounds or political party affiliations," Mr Sossion said. The Knut official said they are preparing questionnaires that would be presented to political parties, which will guide its choice. Mr Sossion said teachers will only back individuals with education interests at heart. He criticised the Jubilee administration for not addressing the grievances of workers, which has prompted strikes by lecturers, doctors and nurses. "It is quite absurd that under the Jubilee government we have witnessed several strikes, with the most serious one being of doctors, which has now lasted more than 80 days," Mr Sossion said. Additionally, he termed the jailing of Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials "most unfortunate".

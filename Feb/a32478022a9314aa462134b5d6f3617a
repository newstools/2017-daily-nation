My training was fine and I thank God so far because it was injury free. I want to run a good race on Sunday and my prayer is to be on the podium, Chepchirchir told Nation Sport. When I was told that I will be on the Tokyo Marathon start list, I started my training in November and there was no holiday season for me. I had a programme to follow and I m going there well prepared. We will run as a team from Kenya since our competitors from Ethiopia use this to beat us. We will plan how to run a night before the race so that we can sweep the medals, she said.Training with Sumgong, she says, gives her a lot of motivation as she wants to be like the Olympic champion one day. email print email print Wilson Kipsang will be going for a world record when he lines up to race in the Tokyo Marathon on February 26.

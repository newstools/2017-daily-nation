SportPesa Premier League giants AFC Leopards will on Sunday take on newly-promoted Kariobangi Sharks in a friendly match at Safaricom Stadium, Kasarani. Both teams will use the match to prepare for the new KPL season which kicks off on February 11. According to Leopards officials, fans will pay an entry fee of Sh100 for the match. Leopards coach Stewart Hall said most of the players he recruited during the pre-season transfer period will feature in the afternoon match scheduled to kick off at 4pm. Leopards will use the match to try out youngsters Marcelas ‘Sheyi’ Ingosi and Lewis Wanami who have been promoted to the senior team. The two impressed club coaches last week in three friendly matches against Embu County, Tetu Combined and Black Stars. Leopards won the matches 3-0, 5-0 and 3-0 respectively. Also expected to be on parade for Leopards is former Tusker and Mathare United attacking midfielder, Kevin Kimani who joined on the transfer deadline. Leopards was expected to play more friendly matches in Western Kenya as part of its preparations for the new season. The club’s secretary-general, Oscar Igaida, on Friday said they are unlikely to move their home matches from Nairobi to Kenyatta Stadium in Embu. He, however, said the team will use Mumias Complex in Western Kenya as its alternative venue for home matches since Nyayo Stadium is currently under renovation. Igaida said while the main team will be taking on Sharks at Kasarani, their team B will be in Narok to feature in another build up at the invitation of Narok Governor, Samuel Tunai. He said the team will conduct football clinics involving several youths stars from the county before playing the afternoon friendly match against Narok Combined.   Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka football club chairmen have vowed “through all means” to contest Football Kenya Federation’s decision to demote them to the lower tier league.

The 2013 World Youth 3,000 metres champion Lilian Kasait Rengeruk stunned Olympic 1,500 meres champion Faith Chepng’etich to win senior women’s 10-kilometre race at South Rift Cross Country Championships held at Olootepes Picnic Site in Kajiado on Saturday. Japheth Korir, the 2013 world cross country champion, continued to smoothen his return with victory in men’s 10km race, his second this season after winning during the second leg of Athletics Kenya Series in November in Kajiado. Two times world cross country junior champion Viola Kibiwott and 2016 Lagos Marathon champion Abraham Kiptum ruled the roost at the Central Rift Cross Country Championships held at the Mosoriot Teachers Training College in Nandi County. Japan-based Alex Mutiso and Grace Kimanzi reigned supreme to win senior men’s and women’s races during the Southern Region championship at Nguutani School in Mwingi. Kasait tore the rich field to shreds in 32 minutes and 41.5 seconds as Chepng’etich, who had withdrawn from the race but opted to compete in the last minute, came in second in 33:09.3. Interestingly, Kasait, who turns 20 on May 3, had won junior races during the Athletics Kenya Cross Country Series in Sotik and Nyahururu. Chepng’etich, who is the 2013 World Cross Country junior champion and the 2015 National Cross Country champion, had competed in two cross country races, finishing second respectively in Athletics Kenya Series in Machakos in December and at the Campaccio Cross in Italy early this month where Hellen Obiri won the two races. Chepng’etich’s elder sister, Beatrice Mutai, who represented Kenya at the 2013 World Cross, was third in 33:15.0 followed by Joan Chepkemoi 33:20.3 and Caroline Chepkemoi 33:23.0.

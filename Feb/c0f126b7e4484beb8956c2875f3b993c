Boda boda riders in Maralal Town held demonstrations over alleged misappropriation of funds meant for construction of shades. They accused the county leadership of squandering Sh5 million that was set aside for the work. The group's chairman, Mr Simon Lekeske, said that had a meeting with the county's secretary Stephen Letinina three months ago but no progress towards addressing their plea has been made. "Out of the 47 counties it is only Samburu that has got no single shade for boda boda operators. We will not get tired asking for our right as taxpayers," Mr Lekeske said Friday. He further condemned the county leadership for barring other leaders who had volunteered to help in the construction, a move he said was meant to frustrate them. Mr Lekeske noted that funds were provisioned to build 10 boda boda shades. Similarly, the organising secretary Josephat Leakono criticised Governor Moses Lenolkula for not attending to the matter even after filing grievances. "We have been paying taxes every day yet we don't have any shade to protect us during the rains and against the scorching sun," Mr Leakono said. They threatened to stage another protest on Monday if the county administration does not reach out to them. When asked about the issue, Governor Lenolkula said his government is always willing to address problems locals face. "We are always ready to listen to the residents and I encourage them to bring the complains to my office," he said.

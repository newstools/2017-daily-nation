Nasa co-principal Moses Wetang’ula has said he is ready to work with whoever will be elected as opposition flagbearer. Addressing supporters in Chakol, Amukura and Malaba town in Busia County in a campaign to popularise his Ford Kenya party, Mr Wetangula said Nasa’s main objective is to unify Kenyans who he said have been subjected to nepotism and tribalism under the Jubilee administration. “The issue of flagbearer shall not divide us the way others are thinking. I am ready to work with whoever will be endorsed as our leader. “Nasa shall bring unity, we will work together to ensure we deliver victory,” said Mr Wetang’ula in Amukura. “Our resolution is to send Jubilee home because they have failed Kenyans big time with empty promises. “A living example is the tarmacking of Busia-Malaba road which is a lie.” PROVIDE SECURITY Mr Wetang'ula promised the Iteso community that he will address their needs if he is chosen as Nasa flag bearer. “I will be Iteso’s first and last line of defence in everything if i become the flag bearer since you have been marginalised for long.” On rowdy youths who disrupted ODM leader Raila Odinga’s public rally in Katilia, Turkana County on Friday, Mr Wetang’ula tasked Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery to act with speed and bring to book those involved. “The government should provide security to all Kenyans everywhere. We don’t condone this kind of primitivism because everyone has the right to assemble as per the constitution,” he said. He called upon locals to take advantage of the two day extended period and register as voters in a bid to kick out Jubilee. He was accompanied by Butula MP Michael Onyura, his Kiminini counterpart Chris Wamalwa, activist and Busia senatorial aspirant Okiya Omtata among other candidates eying parliamentary and MCA seats.

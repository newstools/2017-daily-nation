Kwale Senator Juma Boy Juma has died at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi, Kwale ODM chairman Nicholas Zani has confirmed. He died at 1:30pm. His aide Hamisi Kidunga said the senator was in Mombasa Hospital for a week before being transferred to Aga Khan. Speaking to the Nation at Arabica Café in Mombasa on Sunday morning, Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo said his colleague had been ailing for the past one week. "Senator Boy has been sick for one week and has been receiving treatment in Mombasa Hospital before being transferred to Nairobi three days ago," he said. Senator Madzayo said Mr Juma was put under intensive care unit (ICU). Kwale Woman Representative Zainab Chidzuga and ODM Secretary General Senator Agnes Zani confirmed receiving the sad news. “We cannot speculate but the sad news has come from reliable sources close to the deceased,” said Dr Zani. The senator would be remembered for his poetic language whenever he addressed any gathering. Even when contributing to Senate business, the late Boy got undivided attention from his colleagues because of the way he delivered his message in a fluent and colourful Kiswahili language that mesmerised all and sundry. Senator Boy’s aide Hamisi Kidunga said the deceased's body would be transferred to Mombasa later on Sunday before being taken to Kwale for burial on Monday.

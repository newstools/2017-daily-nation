Anti-corruption detectives have arrested former electoral commission chief executive officer James Oswago over the Chickengate scandal. He was arrested along with Hamida Ali Kibwana and Trevy Oyombra, who is suspected to have been the mastermind behind the Sh46 million bribery scandal involving the printing of ballot papers. The officials are being held at Integrity Centre following their arrest by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives on Wednesday. The charges against them relate to the procurement of ballot papers for the 2010 referendum, as well as for the Shinyalu and Bamachoge by-elections. Prosecutors in the United Kingdom, who also investigated the matter leading to imprisonment of other accomplices there, alleged that the Kenyan electoral officials were paid a sum of £349,057.39 (Sh46 million). The Serious Fraud Office in UK alleged that the electoral officials accommodated bribes in pricing by inflating the prices of ballot papers by up to 38 per cent. More to follow…

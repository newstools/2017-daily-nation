HOLLYWOODEmma Stone completed a clean sweep of Hollywood's major acting prizes on Sunday with an Oscar for her performance as an aspiring actress in the romantic musical "La La Land."Her best actress prize was probably the least surprising victory of a glittering night for Damien Chazelle's nostalgic musical, as the 28-year-old also picked up trophies at the Golden Globes, British BAFTAs and Screen Actors Guild Awards. "To the women in this category... you were all so extraordinary and I look up to you and I admire you more than I can put into words.," said Stone of fellow nominees Isabelle Huppert, Natalie Portman, Ruth Negga and Meryl Streep."La La Land" casts Stone as a wannabe movie star who falls in love with a struggling musician played by Ryan Gosling, who was a losing nominee in the best actor category.The movie pays tribute to classic musicals, with nods to scenes from "Singing in the Rain" (1952) and "Grease" (1978) as well as old-school favourites like "Bringing Up Baby" (1938) and "Top Hat" (1935).Best Supporting Actor Mahershala Ali, Best Actress Emma Stone, Best Supporting Actress Viola Dvis and Best Actor Casey Affleck pose in the press room during the 89th Annual Academy Awards on February 26, 2017.

"I don't condone it. Everybody should go through high school and graduate."Her first role came with the part of Laurie Partridge in the VH1 talent/reality show "In Search of the Partridge Family."She has appeared in more than 20 movies since her 2007 debut in "Superbad" but really came to the fore as a major talent in "The Help," Tate Taylor's 2011 drama about the racism faced by black maids in 1960s Mississippi.A string of hit films followed, including two "Spider-Man" movies and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's "Birdman," which earned Stone a best supporting actress nomination. email print email print Regional chief orders the removal of containers in Sh5 billion Health scandal from NYS Miritini 246 dead and 2,000 displaces as rains pound Zimbabwe.

Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi has told off MPs Mohamed Elmi (Tarbaj) and Adan Keynan (Eldas), accusing them of political hypocrisy. Speaking to journalists in his office in Wajir Town on Sunday, Mr Abdullahi said he has fallen out with the two legislators because he decided to manage Wajir County without their interference. “I will not allow to be a political stooge. They fought me for four years trying to derail my development programmes with unnecessary court cases and petitions [in] the Senate. We kept them at bay and, God willing, in August we will defeat them,” said Mr Abdullahi. The two camps held parallel rallies in Wajir Town on Sunday with Mr Keynan and former Kenya ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohamud Abdi settling for a consultative meeting at a farm in the outskirts of Wajir Town. Mr Abdi is also eyeing the Wajir governor’s seat. Elders led by Degodia Council Chairman Ibrahim Hussein declared Mr Abdullahi as their candidate. Elders from the Ajuran clan last week vowed to support Mr Abdullahi after a three-day campaign tour of Wajir North Constituency. Governor Abdullahi’s team is led by Mr Hussein and is tasked with driving his re-election campaign. Mr Keynan together with Mr Elmi will spearhead Mr Abdi's campaigns. In 2013, the two MPs were opposed to Mr Abdi, whom they now accuse of lack of consultation in the management of the county. Mr Abdullahi was elected on an ODM ticket with over 42,000 votes against Abdi’s 35,000 votes. Mr Mohamed Ali Mursal, who came a distant third with 23,000 votes, is currently supporting Mr Abdullahi.

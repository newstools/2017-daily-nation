MPs will respect the decision of the the salaries agency but have a right to negotiate pay and terms of service like other public workers, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said. Mr Muturi on Friday said the Parliamentary Service Commission had not increased salaries for MPs at the start of the current term. "Parliament has not set its salaries and terms of service. We respect the work of the SRC (Salaries and Remuneration Commission) but we are enjoined to engage the SRC in negotiations, which any other arm of government does," said Mr Muturi at the start of the last retreat of the Assembly's leadership at Serena Beach Resort and Spa in Mombasa. SEVERANCE PAY "It is our legitimate responsibility as the PSC to engage the SRC and other arms of government on what is bestÂ  for our members. When we do that, it cannot be termed as arm-twisting. It is not arm-twisting. It is negotiating," said Mr Muturi. MPs are currently angling to get "severance pay" for the eight months by which their term will be shortened because the elections will be held in August. A court has issued an order stopping that payment as a case filed is heard and determined. The Speaker said efforts to get better pay for MPs should not be viewed differently from what other public workers, like doctors, are doing. "Why does it appear different when you're dealing with politicians?" Mr Muturi asked.  More follows.   Cabinet approves spending of Sh100 billion to increase salaries of all public servants.

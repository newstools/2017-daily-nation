Sauti Sol’s fans in Nakuru now have a reason to look forward to the weekend. Kenya’s favourite boy band are set to rock the town and offering their fans who come to see them perform live an unforgettable experience. Sauti Sol are headlining a concert which will be a street party dubbed “The Chrome Mega Bash with Sauti Sol” at Nakuru’s Grill Park Lounge, this Saturday. The concert by the afro-pop group is the first of three concerts that will see Sauti Sol tour Meru and Machakos later on in their role as brand ambassadors for Chrome Vodka to help drive the brand’s marketing campaign ‘Dream Big, Be Bigger’ #ShineOn. Last year, Sauti Sol held a nationwide tour to popularize their ‘Live and Die in Africa’album. The group have taken to social  media to share their excitement about their upcoming tour. Bien Baraza told www.nation.co.ke that he was sure the band would bring the house down in Nakuru. “We are excited to be going back to Nakuru, last year we had a massive turn out from our fans  and this year am sure we will have even a bigger turn out. We have been pushing ourselves every day to bring a great show to Nakuru. If you thought last year was hot this year will be massive. Chrome is a drink for the youth which embodies our story. We are grateful for this opportunity, come out and lets have fun,” he said. Nakuru concert follows Nairobi’s street bash that was held at Choices Bar along Baricho Road last year.

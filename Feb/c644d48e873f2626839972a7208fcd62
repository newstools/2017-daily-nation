Cord leader Raila Odingaâ€™s daughter Rosemary has been admitted to a hospital in Nairobi and is expected to undergo surgery to remove a suspected tumour in her brain. Sources privy to the matter said Ms Odinga had complained of a headache last weekend, prompting her family to rush her to hospital. The tumour is said to be non-cancerous and doctors suspect it could be applying pressure on her brain and hence causing the headache. It is not clear whether the family knew about the existence of the tumour before her admission last Friday. Ms Odinga was first admitted at Nairobi Hospital on Friday after complaining of headaches, before being transferred to Aga Khan University Hospital on Monday for further check-ups. It is also not clear why she was taken to the two private hospitals before finally being transferred to Aga Khan University Hospital. Although a member of the family confirmed Ms Odinga was indeed in hospital, they did not reveal what could be ailing the Kibra parliamentary aspirant or when she was taken to hospital. The Nation has learned she is under the care of renowned neurosurgeon David Livingstone Oluoch-Olunya, a part-time consultant neurosurgeon at Aga Khan University Hospital and a family doctor of the Odingas. The neurosurgeon operated on the Cord leader in 2010 to relieve pressure that had built up around his brain.   Rosemary Odinga is in the race for the Kibra parliamentary seat.

At least 12 houses were torched in Pimbinyiet, Trans Mara West after clashes between two communities in the area erupted afresh. Oronkai Chief Leboi Ole Munke said nine of the houses were torched on Saturday morning while the other two on Friday evening. Speaking to Nation.co.ke, Mr Munke  said tension was high at the moment but officials are working to contain the situation. "Security officers are alert to avert further damages," he said. The torching of the houses comes barely two days after Narok Governor Samuel Tunai visited Oronkai area that borders Pimbinyiet and promised to ensure amicable solution to a decade long land conflict. He said the National Land Commission Chairman Mohammed Swazuri will visit the volatile border soon. The area has in the past one year experienced tribal conflicts pitting the Masaai and Kipsigis communities. Over 10 people have been killed by gun and poisoned arrows and several others sustained permanent injuries in the conflict. Hundreds have been displaced from their homes after their houses were torched.

Laikipia University has been closed indefinitely following the prolonged strike by lecturers. Through a circular dated February 1, 2017, the university's registrar in charge of administration, J K Kairu, notified students that the institution's senate had resolved that it be closed until the situation returns to normal. "The university senate has resolved that the university be closed indefinitely as there is no teaching or any other academics activity due to the ongoing university staff strike," read the memo, also copied to the vice chancellor. The university has further directed the students to vacate campuses and go home until further notice. The action, according to the circular, will affect students from the main campus in Nyahururu and its satellite campuses. The decision to close the university comes as University Academic Staff Union (Uasu) officials and the government maintain their hard-line positions regarding striking lecturers' grievances. Uasu officials have accused the government of lack of goodwill to end the strike by not giving them a counter-offer on their 2013-2017 collective bargaining agreement. Uasu University of Nairobi chapter secretary George Omondi on Wednesday said the government's failure to issue a counter-offer shows it is not keen on ending the strike. “We had waited for them to send a formal invitation as agreed earlier but, until now, we have not received any,” said Mr Omondi.

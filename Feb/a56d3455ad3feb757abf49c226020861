Kenya’s national cricket team leave for India on Monday enroute to Nepal where they will take part in two 50-overs ICC World Cricket League Championship matched against Nepal at Kirtipur on March 11 and 13. The national team coach, Thomas Odoyo, on Friday said that in India, the boys will play four warm-up games in Ahmedabad and Baroda against select sides which will include Baroda State team players. Baroda’s state team tactician, Martin Jacob, will organise the fixtures. Jacobs is one of the professional players from the sub-continent who took part in the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association league in the 1990s. He represented Kanbis and was a major crowd puller. Whenever he was dismissed, the fans left the ground as they believed the game was over! There are two new faces in the touring squad, who were not in the side that faced Hong Kong in Nairobi last November, namely Elijah Otieno and Pushpak Kerai. They replaced Eugene Ochieng and Narendra Patel respectively.

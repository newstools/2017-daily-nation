Former Harambee Stars defender Simon Gundi died at his home in Mtwapa on Tuesday night after a short illness. Nafisa Gundi, the third born of the late Gundi, said her father got a stroke early last month and was under treatment until his death. She said his father will be buried at Rabai Jimba on Wednesday. Nafisa appealed to well-wishers to help their family with burial expenses. “Fund-raising is being held daily from 6pm behind Chicken Banda Hotel in Mtwapa,” she said. She said those who wanted to help them can also send their contributions through M-Pesa mobile number 0725762056. The late Gundi played as a defender for Kenya’s Harambee Stars and Kenya Breweries (now Tusker) where he made his name. Former Kenya coach Mohammed Kheri joined the football community in mourning and paying tribute to the late Gundi. Kheri said the deceased brought fame to the Coast and the entire country. “I first knew the deceased when  he played for Coast combined team in the 1970’s while I was in charge as the team coach,” said Kheri.

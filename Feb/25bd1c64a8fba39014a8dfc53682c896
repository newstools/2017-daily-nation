Dear Mr Kitoto,Your relationship column has for a long time been a point of reference for me, having answered a question I once sent. The advice that stands out for me is that of September 28, 2015, where you advised a gentleman called Cliff regarding his dilemma between the two women he was in love with. You told him to make a choice to live a disciplined and focused life, not to be selfish, and to be content with the choice you will make because he could not have two women. You also reminded him to make a choice he was willing to defend.This advice came at a time when I was in a relationship crisis. I could not decide who to choose between two women I was involved with since they both had outstanding personalities. At the time, I had just broken up with my ex, who came back to me, telling me that she wanted to give our relationship a second chance, yet I was already in a new relationship. Your answer to Cliff helped me to make a choice. I am happy to report that my relationship is still intact, and getting better and better each day. We are in our twenties and still refer to your articles on many issues that crop up.Thank you, sincerely,Collins Hi CollinsThank you for your response. This column is a platform for dialogue, one that offers help that is aimed at improving how we live. Those who question learn, and those who learn grow. I pray that this season of learning will not end for you. Kitoto. email print email print Governor insists region is an Orange Party zone and tells off opponents.

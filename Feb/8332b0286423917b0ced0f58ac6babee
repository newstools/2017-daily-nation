Are you aspiring to be nominated to run for governor on a Jubilee ticket? Be prepared to fork out an extra Sh400,000 nomination fee besides the Sh100,000 you had paid as registration fee. You only have 11 days to do that. DEADLINE The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has started receiving nomination applications for the different seats from the various parties, with the Jubilee Party saying theirs should be done by March 4. “In order to comply with the timeline, this is to notify the membership of Jubilee Party that the deadline for receiving nomination applications is March 4, 2017,” a notice from Jubilee Party Secretary-General Veronica Maina said. Apart from governor, Ms Maina said, the other affected positions are senator, woman representative, MP and MCA. The party has promised a 50 per cent discount for all aspirants who are women, youth and disabled people. SH500,000 “Even the incumbents are affected by this notice,” said Ms Maina. In the new fees, aspiring governors will part with Sh500,000 (registration plus nomination fees), senators, MPs and woman reps 250,000 each, while MCAs will be charged Sh50,000. “All women, youth and people with disabilities ... shall pay half the amounts for the respective position. However, the 50 per cent discount will not be extended to parliamentary women representative,” said Ms Maina. In the notice, there was no mention of whether the nomination fees will be sent to the IEBC, which the party has insisted must undertake its nominations. NO AGENTS The fees, Ms Maina said, should be paid to Equity Bank's NHIF branch, account number 0180270840079, with the account name Jubilee Party. “No agent or official has been appointed by the Jubilee Party to collect fees on their behalf. "You are therefore requested to report any such [incidents] to the police and Jubilee Party Headquarters,” said Ms Maina.

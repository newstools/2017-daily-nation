The opposition will on Wednesday officially launch the National Supper Alliance, a coalition of parties it will use to face the Jubilee Party in the August 8 elections. The launch, to be held at the Okoa Kenya offices in Nairobi, will be followed by an inaugural rally at Jeevanjee Gardens at 12pm. A communique from the Nasa secretariat to its governors, senators, MPs and National Executive Council members seen by Nation.co.ke states that the ceremony will be held at the Okoa Kenya offices on Jacaranda Avenue in Nairobi on Wednesday. “You are expected to be seated by 8:30 am and later to an inaugural rally at Jeevanjee gardens at 12 pm,” states the invitation sent to the leaders. SIGN COALITION AGREEMENT ODM Chief Executive Officer Oduor Ong’wen said Nasa principals Raila Odinga (ODM), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford-Kenya) will sign the coalition agreement during the ceremony. “The principals will officially sign the coalition agreement that will later be deposited with the registrar of political parties,” Mr Ong’wen told Nation.co.ke. On whether the alliances’ presidential flag-bearer would be announced during the ceremony, Mr Ong’wen said: “That is the very last thing we will do.” The agreement was formulated by the Nasa national co-ordination committee that was established to deliberate on the best choice to run for President under the alliance. ODM director of elections Junet Mohammed said he was aware of the planned meeting but was out of the country.   Ford-Kenya leader accuses local daily of portraying Jubilee as having already won.

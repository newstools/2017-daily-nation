The lawlessness rearing its ugly head in the run-up to the August 8 elections must be tamed before it degenerates into a full-scale conflict with devastating consequences. In Baringo County, two political aspirants have been slain. Granted, the North Rift is a violence-prone area, with bands of goons wreaking havoc in the so-called traditional practice of cattle rustling, which is nothing but a serious crime of armed robbery. With political rivalry thrown into the mix, one can understand the fears that violence could escalate. According to a former senior government official, some aspirants are hiring gangs to intimidate their would-be opponents. But some of the incumbents could also be using similar tactics against people they suspect could oust them in the coming poll. Whatever the case, this is unacceptable in a civilised and democratic country. Security personnel must not only get to the bottom of this particular incident, but even more crucial, come up with stringent measures to curb violence during the elections. For the true verdict of the voters in every ward, constituency and county to emerge, security is paramount. Therefore, more resources and security personnel must be deployed, especially in the traditional hot spots, to boost safety and ensure the holding of a free and fair poll.

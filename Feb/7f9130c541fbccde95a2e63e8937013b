Gachui Black Roots and Shooting Stars on Sunday secured crucial wins in the ward finals of Nairobi Governor’s Cup, and with that, qualification to the constituency phase of the competition. Stars defeated rivals Mutuini Rangers 2-1 in an enticing Dagorretti market derby to secure passage. Juma Stephen scored the opener for the victors in the early minutes of the game. Then Mutuini equalized 10 minutes later via a James Mungai penalty. Macheneri Erick scored the winning goal in the second stanza to hand his team the ward champions tag, alongside Sh50,000 in prize money. Meanwhile, Roots FC had to work hard to defeat determined Uthiru Leeds 5-4 on post-match penalties after the contestants had battled to a 1-1 draw after normal time. Dago Totos also required post-match penalty kicks to dismiss a stubborn Muthama United 5-3 after a barren stalemate. The game was watched by a capacity crowd at Dagoretti grounds in Waithaka ward. “We played without my two key defenders who are nursing injuries but they will be available in the next round of matches,” Totos coach Isaac Mwangi said after the match. The six-month competition, which has brought together about 150 teams mainly consisting of youthful players, has been sponsored by the Nairobi County Government’s Liquor Licensing body to the tune of Sh100 million, and aims at sensitizing the public against the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse.

Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi dissolved a bursary committee over alleged corruption. Speaking at Mukithi village while inspecting development projects, Governor Ndathi ordered the constitution of an new team to be in charge of Kanyekiini ward. The county boss acted on complaints by parents that some committee members were demanding bribes before awarding scholarships to needy children. They claimed they were being forced to pay Sh200 as inducement. "I have received numerous complaints that poor parents are compelled to fork out Sh200 each to get bursary for their school children. "This is corruption of the highest order. Those who are demanding bribes are heartless people who should go home," he said. Mr Ndathi told the parents that bursaries are awarded for free, hence they should not pay in order for their children to benefit. He explained that his government allocated money every financial year to facilitate the education of learners from poor families. "My government sets aside millions of shillings every financial year as bursary for bright and needy children and no one should exploit parents," he added. He said his administration is striving to rout graft. Further, he urged parents to continue exposing dishonest officials working in all the wards. Additionally, the county chief announced that Sh20 million will be spent to improve roads in Kanyekiini. "We have awarded tenders to various contractors and the improvement work will kick off next week," he said. The governor observed that roads are usually impassable, particularly during rainy seasons - making farmers incur losses for being unable to deliver goods to the markets for sale on time. "We want to make sure that all rural roads are improved to all weather status so that residents can benefit." He also appealed to the locals to register as voters in large numbers to be able to participate in the August polls.

Police in Mombasa have arrested two suspects in connection with the theft of 500 bags of sugar worth Sh2 million. The suspects allegedly drugged the driver and turn boy before driving the truck to a secret location off the Mombasa-Nairobi highway where they offloaded the sweetener. The incident took place between Mazeras and Mariakani. Coast regional CID boss Pius Macharia said the two took the sugar to Kiembeni estate in Mombasa and started transferring it into new bags. "After [the driver and the turn boy] gained consciousness they narrated how they gave a woman a lift who gave them juice. The drink appears to have been laced with drugs," he said. He added: "We are still doing investigations and will take them to court on Monday. This is a syndicate that is operating between Mombasa and Mariakani and we have crucial leads that will enable us to arrest the masterminds." The driver and his colleague were found unconscious by the owner of the vehicle on Thursday. Mr Macharia said last week a lorry ferrying stolen pharmaceuticals was impounded by police at Miritini. He suspects the same cartel to be behind the sugar theft.

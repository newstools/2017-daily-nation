Persistent delays in finalising and tabling the report of a parliamentary committee investigating the National Youth Service scandal have raised serious concerns about its integrity. In fact, there have been reports that some members might have been compromised to scuttle it. This is why we echo the pledge by some MPs to finalise the report in the next few days. The National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee that has been looking into the scam in which more than Sh791 million is suspected to have been stolen has an obligation to complete the job and recommend sanctions on those found culpable. The committee has spent time and public resources on the investigations and must deliver the results. By failing to make public the findings of an investigation that has taken months to complete, the PAC is presenting the public with an opportunity to doubt its competence and impartiality in the matter. What makes the team’s silence even more suspicious is the fact that Parliament could adjourn indefinitely soon, owing to the coming elections, making the whole investigation a nullity. The people whom the committee interviewed, including former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru, have a right to know if they will be cleared of allegations of fraud or taken to court. The PAC must release the report without further delay.

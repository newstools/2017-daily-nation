On Tuesday, a man with a striking resemblance to Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka set the internet on fire when his photo landed in the hands of Kenyans on Twitter (KOT). The man, identified as Jesse Kinyanjui, started trending when he was featured in a local daily, saying his neighbours had nicknamed him Kalonzo. Under the hashtag #Kalonzobro, #KOT made all manner of jokes, with some claiming Mr Musyoka could have sired the young man out of wedlock. Osumo Shem tweeted: "Kenya is a big nation. But men and fathers make it small", while Gilbert Kipp fired: "Ile siku Kalonzo aliambia journalist (the day Kalonzo told a journalist) 'your second name betrays you' nikajua (I knew) tribalism is a disease. Shame on him #KalonzoBro." IT WASN'T ME For a day, Mr Musyoka stomached the jokes. Not anymore. Today, he told a campaign rally that he has no blood ties with the Jesse who works in Nairobi’s Upper Hill area.   “It was not my work,” the former VP told residents of Embu town. He said he was equally surprised by the uncanny resemblance with the young man. “I have seen another Kalonzo on the internet,” he said. MEETING “Huyo kijana wa Kiambu anaitwa Kinyanjui ni Kalonzo kabisa. Ni Kalonzo tupu (That Kiambu young man is like my true copy). He is my complete look-alike. But be assured that I didn’t sire him,” he said. Mr Musyoka said he would look for Jesse so they can get acquainted, adding that their resemblance shows that Kenya is one. He also used the forum to urge Kenyans to live harmoniously and reminded people of Mount Kenya how he served dedicatedly under President Kibaki. He asked them to return the favour by backing him and the National Super Alliance (Nasa). Mr Musyoka was accompanied by Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. Additional reporting by Harry Misiko.

Police have arrested 23 boda boda operators believed to have been involved in the setting ablaze of a matatu that knocked down a cyclist on Lang'ata road on Saturday. Police spokesman George Kinoti, in a statement on Sunday evening, said the suspects will be arraigned in court once investigations are concluded. Mr Kinoti also said the man was fatally injured. "This comes after the police launched quick investigations into the incident where boda boda riders in the vicinity burned the Ongata Rongai Sacco matatu shortly after it knocked down a male cyclist, who sustained fatal injuries," the statement read. Further, Mr Kinoti condemned those engaging hooliganism, saying people must let police conduct investigations. "We have noted with grave concern that some boda boda riders have developed a tendency of quickly mobilizing their members whenever an incident involving one of them happens and proceed to harass members of public or even destroy property like the incident in Nairobi. "We wish to warn that this manner of hooliganism, disregarding traffic laws as well as other penal code laws will not be tolerated," he said. Mr Kinoti added that police officers have been instructed to deal firmly with all law breakers.

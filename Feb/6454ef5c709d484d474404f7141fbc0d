All is now set for the establishment of the first public university in Turkana County after Governor Josphat Nanok signed an agreement with Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. On Wednesday, Governor Nanok inked a deal with the university’s top officials, led by Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Prof Egara Kabaji, who is also acting as the principal of the constituent college. The governor urged the university to prioritise courses on dry-land farming, health and education, among others. These areas, he said, are critical in the development of the arid and semi-arid region whose many residents are pastoralists.

"However, I can assure you that there is goodwill from the people of Turkana and the county government,” Governor Nanok said. He informed the university’s administration that water from the Napuu aquifer will be pumped to the campus to ensure adequate and reliable supply. Masinde Muliro has already been given a parcel of land at Nadapal for setting up a campus. Prof Kabaji said the agreement will allow the university's administration to incorporate development programmes by the county government in a strategic development plan that is being formulated. He said the university had asked for the admission of 600 government-sponsored students to join the over 400 continuing students inherited from Mount Kenya University.

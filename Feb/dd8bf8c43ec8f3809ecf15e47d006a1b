Ulinzi Stars on Saturday edged out Al Hilal Benghazi of Libya 5-4 on post-match penalties to advance to the Caf Confederation Cup first round at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. Ulinzi beat the visitors 1-0 in the second leg at Kasarani to level the tie 1-1 following their 1-0 loss to Benghazi in Cairo, Egypt last weekend. Former Sony Sugar forward Samuel Onyango provided the solitary goal in regulation time, a well weighted shot from the right side in the 18th minute that beat goalkeeper Murad Alwuheeshi. The soldiers had a late opportunity to kill the tie after Makwatta, who missed the first leg due to paperwork issues, teed up substitute Enosh Ochieng with two minutes left, only for the former Muhoroni Youth forward to spurn the chance. Goalkeeper James Saruni emerged hero after the nervy penalty shootout, punching out a spot kick taken by Abdalla Alshafi to make up for the shortcomings of Enosh Ochieng, who had also failed to convert his penalty.   Oscar Wamalwa, Baron Oketch, Samuel Onyango, John Mark Makwatta and Mbongi were all successful in their spot kicks, sending the handful fans in the stadium into a frenzy.   Taking his penalty in the sudden death, Benghazi’s Essam Alamshi sent the ball ricocheting off the cross bar, igniting wild cheers from the soldiers.         This left Alamshi inconsolable as the soldiers mounted a mock guard of honour inside the pitch to celebrate their success.     “We didn’t focus too much on penalties during training because I believed that we would score more than two goals and proceed to the next stage. I just told the boys to relax and concentrate on the task at hand and although they lost several chances, I am happy that they frustrated the opponents,” Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso said after the match. Ulinzi coach Benjamin Nyangweso had made only one change to the starting lineup that did duty in the first leg match, bringing in Makwatta for Gor Mahia loanee Baron Oketch. Makwatta was guilty of fluffing two clear chances in the second half. Onyango was however enjoying a splendid afternoon and had threatened goalkeeper Alwuheeshi once before he found the back of the net. There was a bizarre moment in the ninth minute when Faisal Albadari raised his hands high in the middle of the pitch to obstruct an oncoming ball. He however got away with a yellow card as the soldiers threated to open the scoring. Makwatta also found himself wrongly booked in the 71st minute for a hard tackle on his marker, before the referee quickly rescinded his decision and sanctioned John Kago who had been the real culprit.   Ulinzi will now tackle Egypt's Smouha in the first round of the preliminaries in another two-legged tie next month.

Skin types have been divided into three general groups â€“ oily, dry and normal. This helps to identify general characteristics which make it easier to find a proper skin care regime. There are many people who do not fall into any one of these groups but fall under combination skin. This is where two skin types exist on one face. For example, the presence of an oily T-zone on the forehead and down to the chin, while the cheeks remain dry. Skin types are determined by measuring the amount of oil, or sebum produced in the skin. Normal skin is the ideal, whereby just enough oil is produced. Oily skin produces more oil than is needed and is identified by a greasy film and blemishes on the surface. Dry skin appears rough and flaky and often suffers from a lack of sebum. This leads to the loss of moisture from the surface, giving way to dehydration.

It is, therefore, important to tailor your skin care regime to incorporate these changes. This would go a long way in preventing problems. Pay attention to any changes and act accordingly.

Police shot dead two suspected robbers while responding to a distress call in Buruburu, Nairobi. A night guard had called the police at midnight to inform them of a robbery at Ngong Court in the estate’s Phase 5. “Officers [acted] on a tip-off from a watchman that there were three young men riding on a motorcycle and robbing members of the public. The officers confronted them and challenged them to stop and surrender, but they defied [the orders] and opened fire,” police said. According to police, a revolver loaded with three bullets and a homemade pistol with two rounds of ammunition were found at the scene. Police said two mobile phones were also found on the dead suspects. At about the same time, a different team of officers was engaged in a shootout with a gang in the city’s Hardy estate. The shooting happened at Sichuan Huash Enterprises on Karongo Road. The officers had rushed there after being informed of an ongoing break-in. “As the officers arrived at the gate a thug who was a sentry fired at the officers. The officers shot back but the gangsters managed to escape towards a nearby bush. Area combed but no arrest or recovery was made,” a police report said. An unknown amount of money and a laptop were stolen from an office in the premises. The owner of the premises told police that the gang gained entry through the fence.

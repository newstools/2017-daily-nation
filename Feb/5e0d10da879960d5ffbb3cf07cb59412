A general labourer at Comply timber factory in Nakuru’s Industrial Area died on the spot after a flying sharp metal cut him on the head as he was repairing a machine on Saturday. His colleague, who is a machine operator, sustained serious injuries on the head and is fighting for his life in Valley Hospital's intensive care unit. According to workers at the factory, the accident occurred at around 7pm. By the time Nation arrived at the factory at 8pm, the body of the victim was still lying at the scene of accident. Police from Kaptembwo Police Station arrived at 9.14pm, more than three hours after the accident occurred, and took the body to Valley Hospital mortuary. Speaking outside the factory, the branch secretary of the Kenya Building, Timber and Construction and Furniture Industries workers Union, Rev Maurice Shisoka Shiundu, said the two workers were on routine maintenance when the accident occurred. The union official said that the two workers were permanent employees and had worked at the factory for more than three years. MACHINE HAD METAL GUARD The union official said that the machine which the two workers were repairing had a metal guard which accidentally opened, giving way for flying metal objects which hit the employees heads. Rev Shisoka, who said that this was not the first time such an accident is happening at the factory, blamed the police for taking too long to arrive at the scene despite being informed of the accident soon after it occurred. “This accident is coming in the wake of another accident where an employee was beheaded by a machine while others have suffered serious hands and legs injuries,” said Rev Shisoka. The union official said that many of the workers who have lost their limbs and died while on duty have not been compensated. “Comply management should ensure that those who have been injured are compensated because there are many pending cases while the victims continue to suffer in pain,” said Rev Shisoka.

Eldoret lawyer Simon Lilan was dealt a blow on Tuesday after the court ordered him to pay the family of Mr Mark Too the costs they incurred while challenging a case he had filed against burial of the former Member of Parliament. Eldoret Principal Magistrate Harrison Barasa said: “I order that the plaintiff do bear the costs and incidentals of this application, as prayed for by the defendants”.The family had filed the case last week, requesting payment of the money they had spent defending themselves after the lawyer sought orders to stop Mr Too’s burial. Mr Lilan’s quest to stop the burial was dismissed. Last week, through lawyer Steve Biko, the family argued that Mr Lilan should cover all the costs they incurred since he is the one who took them to court. The former MP collapsed at his home in Eldoret on December 31 and was pronounced dead at St Luke’s Hospital, Eldoret.

A minibus driver was on Wednesday night killed by suspected Pokot bandits near Tot in Kerio Valley as insecurity in the region deteriorates. The ill-fated vehicle, christened "Taproots", which operates on the Eldoret-Tot road, was attacked at Chemukutet, a few metres from Tot in Marakwet East Sub-County at around 7.30pm. The driver, identified as Paul Kanandi, 32, died on the spot, according to Marakwet East Deputy County Commissioner Erick Mulevu. Three other people were injured after the bandits sprayed bullets on the vehicle once the driver lost control and it started rolling. Officers from the nearby Tot Police Station rushed to the scene as the bandits started shooting at the injured passengers. The same bus had narrowly escaped an ambush by the bandits at the same spot three days ago. At the time of the attack, it had only eight passengers as others had alighted before reaching Tot. Security officers estimated that at least 10 gun-wielding suspected Pokot bandits from Tiaty lay in wait for the bus. When it arrived, the gunmen began shooting, first aiming at the driver, who instantly lost control. Mr Mulevu said the vehicle then started rolling with the passengers inside. One passenger suffered gunshot wounds while two others were hurt when the vehicle rolled. “Were it not for quick response from the nearby Tot Police Station, the passengers could have been killed by the bandits who were moving in to descend on the rolling vehicle,” said the administrator. Residents said all the passengers would have been killed were it not for the swift response by the police. County Police Commander Tom Odera said the officers are already on the ground pursuing leads in their search for the bandits.

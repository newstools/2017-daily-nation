The Labour Party of Kenya (LPK) has protested against a move by the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal to restrain Budalangi MP Ababu Namwamba from acting as its member and leader. In a letter dated February 28 signed by LPK Chairperson Julia Auma Ojiambo, the party states that: “No case, suit or complaint of any kind can be filed in the name of Labour Party without a resolution of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party.” CONFIDENCE “The party NEC has not made any such resolution or even discussed or contemplated such cause of action.” In the letter to the registrar of the tribunal, Prof Ojiambo argues that they have not been served with any “purported suit papers.” “We have instructed out attorneys to promptly deal with this “fraudulent action.” Prof Ojiambo said the party has full confidence in Mr Namwamba, adding that “any attempt to misuse the good name of our party and to besmirch the character of our leadership should be dealt with the contempt it deserves.” AFFIDAVIT On Monday, the tribunal, led by Kyalo Mbobu and Milly Odongo barred Mr Namwamba from acting as a member and party leader pending the hearing and determination of the application. This followed an application my Mr John Barasa Makokha, on behalf of LPK, asking the tribunal to bar Mr Namwamba from transacting any business on behalf of the party. Mr Makokha had sworn an affidavit with the tribunal on the matter on January 27, 2017. MOTION On Monday, the tribunal also ordered the claimant to serve the notice of motion together with the statement of claim. The matter is scheduled to be heard on March 9. Mr Namwamba had resigned as secretary-general of the Orange Democratic Movement in 2016 before joining LPK where he was named party leader. He cited "frustration" as the main reason why he ditched the party led by Mr Raila Odinga.   Tribunal suspends his membership in the Julia Ojiambo party.

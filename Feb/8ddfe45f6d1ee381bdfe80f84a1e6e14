Three suspected remnants of the Sabaot Land Defence Force were on Friday lynched by irate residents in Cheptais, Mt Elgon. The angry residents also torched the suspects' houses. According to the residents the three youths allegedly killed an elderly man whose body was found in Mt Elgon forest.

Cheptais police boss Ezekiel Kiche said the three were hunted down, seized by angry villagers before they were stoned to death. "Investigation is ongoing, the law does not allow mob justice they should have arrested them and handed them to us,‚Äù he said. He said security personnel have been deployed in the area to stop further killings. Mr Kiche added that two other suspects are receiving treatment in hospital while 10 youths have been arrested and are being held at Cheptais Police Station.

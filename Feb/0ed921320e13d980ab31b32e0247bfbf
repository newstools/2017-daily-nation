LONDON Arsene Wenger insisted on Friday he would still be a manager next season even if he was no longer at Arsenal. The Frenchman, in charge of north London side Arsenal for more than 20 years, is under intense scrutiny following the Gunners' humiliating 5-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday. Wenger, 67, who is out of contract at the end of the current campaign, said he would make a decision on his Arsenal future in March or April. "No matter what happens I will manage next season whether it is here or somewhere else, that is absolutely for sure," he said.

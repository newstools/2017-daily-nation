The curtain falls on the Africa Cup of Nations tonight when a young and exciting Cameroon team squares off against the more experienced Egyptians. It has been a month of surprises in Gabon as several favourites, including the holders Ivory Coast and the heavily fancied Algerians, were sent packing in the early stages. Once again, Kenya has been reduced to spectating on television with only Uganda (which put up a creditable performance despite being eliminated in the first round) representing the wider Eastern African region. It is to be hoped Kenya will learn lessons from countries such as Cameroon which, despite not having the usual galaxy of superstars, have crafted a young, exciting and cohesive team marshalled by a clearly gifted head coach in the Belgian Hugo Broos. Their success shows a team does not need a huge number of established stars to make headway. A good youth football setup and proper guidance at the national team level is all it takes. Overall, there are many positives to take from Gabon 2017. The quality of refereeing has been of a high standard and general discipline on the pitch has been good. However, the standard of playing surfaces was often dire, something that should change before the next edition. Looking further ahead, one change that organisers should consider is holding the tournament every four years rather than every two. The critics that have long demanded this change have a legitimate point that it would serve to set the stage for a more exciting, high-stakes battle than currently exists. Cameroon and Egypt deserve to be in the final. It is to be hoped they serve up a contest worthy of what has been a generally well-organised tournament.

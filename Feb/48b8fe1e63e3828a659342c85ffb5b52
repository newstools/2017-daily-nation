Resolving land matters and promoting environmental conservation are likely to take shape following a move by the United Nations providing Nandi County with Sh1.2 billion. The county is among seven others that will benefit from a five-year programme by Food Agriculture Organization (Fao), officially called 'Support to the Attainment of Vision 2030 through Devolved Land Reforms in Community Lands of Kenya'. It will be conducted in collaboration with the national and county governments and the National Land Commission. Speaking during a courtesy on Nandi County, Fao's representative to Kenya Husna Mbarak said the initiative is ready for roll out, with key interest in land administration, natural resources, planning policy and capacity development. "We are here in Nandi to roll out the programme on land resource and governance. Itâ€™s our hope that we are going to have a fruitful engagement with all the partners for a long and sustainable partnership in order to attain our objective," she said. On his part, Dr John Chumo, Lands, Environment and Natural Resources executive, commended the organisation for the commendable task it has set out to do. "We wish to thank Fao for considering Nandi County. Automation of land tittles will significantly resolve cases of lost files and improve service delivery. "We want to assure the organisation of our support and we are going to implement it to the letter," he said. Other beneficiaries are Tana River, West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo, Samburu, Marsabit, and Laikipia; which are all arid and semi arid areas. Some of the forests in Nandi include Kimondi, Tindiret, Nandi North and Nandi South.

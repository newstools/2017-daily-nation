More than 4,000 youths from the Somali community living in Mombasa and other Coast counties lack national identity cards to enable them register as voters. Officials of the Mombasa Somali community committee Thursday held a closed-door meeting with the Coast Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa to raise their grievances including alleged extortion by registration officials as they seek to get IDs. Led by their chairman, Mr Mohamed Hurie Ibrahim, they told journalists that they have been assured by Mr Marwa that their grievances will be investigated and appropriate action taken. Mr Ibrahim told reporters that they have registered complaints from several members of their communities that registration officers demand between Sh50,000 to Sh200,000 in bribe before attending to them. “Our community [members] have been turned into money minting machines by State officers who demand for bribes before serving them yet we pay taxes like any other Kenyans,” said Mr Ibrahim. He alleged that those who fail to bribe are asked to travel to their counties in north eastern region to apply for the IDs. The Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya treasurer, Sheikh Hassan Omar, who also attended the meeting told reporters that some senior registration officers who have worked for long time in one stations are the one perpetrating the taking of bribes. “We have their names and if appropriate action will not be taken, we shall document their names and send them to the appropriate offices,” added Sheikh Omar.

One person was shot and beheaded while another was critically injured when bandits raided a village in Kerio Valley on Sunday afternoon. Locals said they believed the killers were given instructions to take the heads of their victims. According to Marakwet East deputy county commissioner Erick Mulevu, the headless torso of the 60-year-old, identified as James Cheptoo Cheserek, was found at the scene of the attack in Kaptora Sub-Location. Police took the body to the mortuary and the injured man to hospital. The cattle rustlers took eight cows. According to Kaben chief Joseph Lokanda, another person sustained gunshot wounds in another daytime attack at Sindar grazing fields in Endo Ward when Marakwet youths repulsed a group of rustlers believed to be Pokot. Elgeyo-Marakwet Police Commander Tom Odera told the Nation that the situation was getting worse. “We are yet to make a full report on the fighting,” he said. There were concurrent attacks in Mogil, Cheptarbei and Sindar in Kaben, Marakwet East, confusing locals and police officers. Tot Day Secondary School principal Lawrence Mutwol asked the government to improve security. “What does this government think about this banditry? How does it expect students and teachers to concentrate in their work when guns are never silent? This is very traumatising,” said Mr Mutwol. Endo Ward Rep Festus Kirop yesterday called for an overhaul of the security team, starting with County Commissioner Fredrick Ndambuki, insisting that the team had failed residents and the government. “What is the need of having people like Ndambuki who do nothing when people are dying?” asked the politician whose ward has borne the brunt of the violence. Inspector-General of Police Joseph Boinnet, who was to open two police posts in the valley on Saturday, cancelled the visit following an ambush on a convoy of security chiefs on Friday.

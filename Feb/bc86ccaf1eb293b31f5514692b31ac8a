A police officer accused of defiling a nine-year-old girl has a case to answer, a Nakuru court has ruled. Resident magistrate Judicaster Nthuku in her ruling on Monday said the police had established enough evidence to put James Kiarie Gicho an Administration Police officer attached to the Ngera AP Camp in Bureti, Nakuru County to his defence Mr Kiarie has denied charges of defiling the minor on in 2015 at his house at the police camp in Bureti. The minor who testified in court said she had gone to visit her aunt whom she found not available at her place. The girl told the court that her aunt’s neighbour handed her to the police officer at the police camp where she was to spend the night. The court heard that the officer however took advantage of her since it was late and she had nowhere to spend the night. “The man locked me in his house and forced me to undress while on his bed before he did to me bad manners,” said the girl. The court further heardd that the accused person threatened to kill the girl and told her not to tell anyone what had happened. She however told the court that she had to tell her mother after she experienced much pain in her private parts. The mother reported the matter to the police leading to the arrest of the suspect. The case will be heard on April 3.

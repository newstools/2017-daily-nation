Mukidza converted two of them for KCB s first half score. Peter Kilonzo added only one try for the bankers in the second half but it was not enough to prevent the defeat.Mwamba failed to uphold the spark from last weekend s 15-7 win against Quins when their player Marcus Mureiithi dropped the ball with the tryline in sight to squander an equalizing opportunity.That saw Mwamba lose 33-40 to Impala. Impala led 33-7 before they incurred three successive yellow cards to see Mwamba reduce the deficit at 33-35. email print email print Counties will take care of their medical workers after that, Rotich says.

"I just wanted to test my body and see how I will handle the rich field at the national cross," said Rungaru, who is based on Japan but competed for Embakasi. "I know the nationals will be challenging but all I want is to finish in a respectable position to make the team for the World Cross." The 2014 Africa Cross Country junior champion Moses "Mukono" Letoiye,who was expected to compete in the senior event, stayed out but still got a wild card to the Nairobi team for the National Cross Country due February 18 at Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.

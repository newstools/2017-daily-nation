Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has challenged governors in the Nyanza region to set up a kitty to pay elderly people a monthly stipend to uplift their living standards. Mr Midiwo said the programme currently funded by the national government had left several people out and they have continued to wallow in poverty. The county governments, he said, should have a budget to complement the programme. “It is a serious case of failure by our governors to let elders suffer in poverty when just between Sh2,000 and Sh3,000 can address their plight,” said Mr Midiwo on a morning radio talk show on Monday. He said parting with the amount to cater for food for the elderly should not be a problem to the governors. He said if the elderly can get Sh100 for food daily, they can live comfortably. He said there is a need to elect “clean” governors to help ODM leader Raila Odinga achieve his devolution dreams. “Let’s not elect governors with poor manifestos,” he added. Leaders of the Luo Council of Elders Willis Otondi (chairman) and Owino Nyady (secretary-general), had proposed that county governments support elders.

A local insurance company is exploring the possibility of introducing a policy to compensate SportPesa Premier League clubs in the event their players either get injured, or are not available for duty for one reason or another. This was revealed on Tuesday by Fidelity Insurance Managing Director Matthew Koech at a function in Nairobi where the firm extended its Coach of the Month sponsorship deal with the Sports Journalist Association of Kenya (SJAK). Under the new deal, the outstanding coach each month will pocket Sh75,000, up from Sh50,000 awarded last term. “Just as we celebrate Kenyan players doing the country proud in foreign leagues, we need to celebrate coaches when they are sought after to improve the game elsewhere,” said Koech. “We take great pride in the fact that our national team coach is Kenyan and Harambee Stars’ performances have continued to improve. It’s our hope as SJAK that this association with Fidelity will inspire our coaches to attain higher qualification and even seek jobs abroad,” said SJAK chairman Chris Mbaisi. The best performing coach each month will be selected by a panel of football writers, who will analyse mainly the individual trainer’s performances and results.   George Owino is upbeat Mathare will perform well in the forthcoming season.

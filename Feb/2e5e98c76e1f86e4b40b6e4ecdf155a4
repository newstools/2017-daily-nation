The Kenya Medical Association (KMA) has asked their members in private hospitals and universities to strike for 48 hours in solidarity with their seven colleagues who were jailed on Monday. The 48-hour count starts from Wednesday midnight. Doctors, the lobby said on Tuesday, should await further instructions should the doctors’ leaders be still in jail “at the expiry of this period.” TRANSFERRED Seven officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union are serving a 30-day jail term at Langata and Industrial Area prisons in Nairobi but there are reports that some have been transferred to other jails. Judge Hellen Wasilwa sent them to prison for contempt of court after they called a nationwide strike on December 5, 2016 against her order. Led by KMA Chair Jacqueline Kitulu, the doctors and specialists from 18 medical professional organisations have also asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to axe Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu and his Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri with immediate effect. MEMBERSHIP REVOKED “There will be no negotiations if the doctors are in jail as they are the only ones mandated to do so. The Cabinet and Principal Secretaries are collectively responsible for this crisis and they should sacked,” Dr Kitulu told journalists on Tuesday. At the same time, KMA has stripped Dr Mailu and Dr Muraguri of their membership. The doctors have also appealed to the Court of Appeal to “set aside the current judgment” and for the government to take all necessary steps to end the “judicial circus to amicably resolve this crisis.”  More follows.    Cotu boss accuses Muraguri of secretly inciting doctors’ officials to take a hard-line stance.

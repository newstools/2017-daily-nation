BARCELONA Barcelona boss Luis Enrique admitted his side's 4-0 Champions League mauling at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain could have been even worse as he insisted he has taken no decision over his future on Saturday. The Spanish champions are on the verge of not reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 10 years after defeat in Paris that matched their heaviest in Enrique's three-year reign. "Evidently, it is a huge blow for everyone, but the sky hasn't caved in," Enrique said on Saturday ahead of his side's clash at home to Leganes."The opponent deserves more. They were better, we have to accept that. "It was a fair result. The truth is it could have been even more." Enrique has received fierce criticism over the past few days with even midfielders Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta questioning his tactics. The former Barca captain is out of contract at the end of the season with no talks scheduled over a renewal. However, he claimed that the debacle in Paris would not decide whether he decides to stay on if offered a new deal. "The only thing that is clear is that what happens in these months has nothing to do with my decision," he added. "Not one game, not 10 games, no even our 38 games this year. "I still haven't made my decision."   Madrid-based AS's headline ran "total disaster."

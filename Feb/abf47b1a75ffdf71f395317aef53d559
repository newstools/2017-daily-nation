Natural products are kinder to the skin and body than chemical products are. Although they take a tad longer to work, the results they produce are well worth waiting for. When you think of your skin as a precious possession requiring good care to see you through a lifetime, you will seek out the best that nature offers. Some most helpful face products include skin tonics which help to clarify and revitalise your skin. The tonics can be easily made at home for daily use. Here are some of the most effective ones. • Basil skin tonic Basil, also known as the holy plant is not only excellent as a food flavouring. It offers great skin beautifying benefits as well. Use on acne-prone skin for fast healing. It works well to freshen up dull skin and to restore sun burnt skin back to glowing health. Make a tonic by boiling basil leaves for 5 minutes. Strain the mixture and use daily as a toner. TIP: Basil is also helpful for dandruff and falling hair. • Green tea toner: Green tea helps to tighten and brighten the skin. The results are often noticeable immediately. It works well on pigmented patches and sunburns. To make a tonic, steep one teaspoonful of green tea leaves in hot boiling water for 5 minutes. Strain and pat onto clean skin. Allow it to dry and then follow with moisturizer. Do not rinse it off. •  Chamomile skin tonic: Chamomile contains azulene, a powerful anti-acne remedy. Add a spoon of this herb to hot water for face steaming. Steam your face for 10 minutes during which the azulene vapour is released. Pat dry and rinse before applying moisturizer.

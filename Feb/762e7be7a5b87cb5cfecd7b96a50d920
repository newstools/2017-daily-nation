A 33-year-old man committed suicide by self-immolation after a quarrel with his wife in Nyamarambe, Kisii County. Police said Evans Ondieki had an argument with his wife over an alleged extramarital affair. "Following the disagreement, Ondieki chased away his wife, locked himself in his bedroom and set himself ablaze using mattresses. He died on the spot," county commander Agnes Mudambi said. The incident occurred in the evening in Mochachi village, Bomonyara location, on Saturday. Ms Mudambi said the couple had fought on several occasions. "The coupleâ€™s problems are well known in the village. But it seems the alleged infidelity was the last straw that dove him to suicide," she added. The charred remains were found on the bed after the fire was put out. The body is at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital awaiting a post-mortem. Police are investigating the incident.

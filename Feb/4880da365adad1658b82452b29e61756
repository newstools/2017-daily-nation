Ford-Kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula says he has no plans to ditch the National Super Alliance (Nasa) should he fail to become its presidential flag-bearer. Mr Wetang’ula said he and the fellow opposition leaders Raila Odinga, Musalia Mudavadi and Kalonzo Musyoka have an equal chance of clinching the ticket to fly the coalition's flag. "It will not matter whether it is Raila, Musalia, Kalonzo or myself who is picked [to be] the Nasa flag-bearer. Our aim is to ensure the Jubilee administration is sent packing for running down the country," the Bungoma senator said. READ: Raila should back me, says Wetang'ula The legislator, who took his mass voter registration campaign to Mumias East constituency, urged the Luhya community to reject Jubilee. Mumias East is the home turf of MP Benjamin Washiali, a key Jubilee point man in Kakamega County. Both Jubilee and opposition politicians have been criss-crossing the country urging Kenyans to enlist as voters before the window is closed on February 14. Mr Wetang’ula said campaigns by Jubilee politicians aiming to discredit Cord leaders will not bear fruit. He addressed residents at Makunga, Kayimba and Shianda. He said opposition leaders will do all it takes to promote unity among its members. Further, Mr Wetang’ula urged sugarcane farmers in Mumias to support Nasa and pledged its leadership would address their plight, and ensure the financially troubled Mumias Sugar Company is revived. He was accompanied by Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, who declared he will challenge Governor Wycliffe Oparanya for the post in the August 8 elections. Senator Khalwale said he wants to be the next governor because he will manage county funds better unlike the incumbent. "We have received a lot of money as a county in the last four years, but the funds have not been properly managed due to lack of financial discipline among county officials," he said.

Butchers in Nakuru County who wrap meat with old newspapers will be fined Sh50,000 or go to jail for three years if a Bill before the assembly becomes law. The Bill is sponsored by Kapkures MCA Joseph Lang’at. It states that traders should wrap meat using materials approved by a public health official. At the same time, butchers who cut bones using an axe or a panga instead of a saw will be fined Sh5,000 or be jailed for nine months, or both. The Bill also restricts aspirants for political seats from pasting campaign posters in public places. Instead, they will be required to paste them in authorised places or they will be fined Sh20,000 or be jailed for six months, or both. EXPIRY DATES Supermarkets that have been selling fast food without showing expiry dates on it will now be required to comply with the new law or pay a fine of Sh50,000 or serve a nine-month jail term, or both. Jua Kali workers who accumulate refuse for long periods will be fined Sh75,000 or serve one year in prison. Those found discharging toxic effluent into Lake Nakuru will be fined Sh100,000 or serve three years in jail. The Bill now awaits its third reading before it is forwarded to Governor Kinuthia Mbugua for his signature. Mr Lang’at said the objective is to improve safe handling of food, promote proper methods of sanitation and disposal of hazardous waste, and conserve the environment.

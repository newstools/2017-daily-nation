Reports from the violence-torn North Rift are a strong indictment of the government. It seems the State has surrendered and left the region under the control of rag-tag and barefoot gangs. The killing of seven people in the past one week, the exodus of some residents and closure of dozens of schools are a statement of anarchy. And a humanitarian crisis looms large as relief agencies, including the Red Cross, have closed up shop as they cannot guarantee the security of their staff. The gangs have become so daring that they do not give a hoot about the government. On Friday, Deputy President William Ruto found himself in a cross-fire in Baringo as his meeting was disrupted by armed gangs who clearly sought to flex their muscle. His shoot-to-kill directive had not subdued the blood-thirsty gangsters. At the face value, the internecine fights in Baringo, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Pokot and Turkana are attributed to cattle rustling and contest over pasture. But that is simplistic. Politics and economics are right at the centre of this. The slaying of two politicians in Tiaty constituency in Baringo brought to the fore the deadly rivalry for power. Cattle rustling, which in days yore was a traditional practice, has been turned into a money-minting enterprise. Discovery of oil and water in Turkana have added to the resource-greed. Clearly, the violence raises pertinent questions the government must answer. Where do the gangs obtain the dangerous weapons? Where is security intelligence? How many lives must be lost before a solution to this perennial problem is found? Why canâ€™t the armoured vehicles and equipment recently acquired be deployed to these areas? Politicians from the region pretty well know the gangs, their hideouts and their funders. They must be investigated. Time is running out and President Uhuru Kenyatta and the government must deal with the matter fast and decisively. Politicians and security officials involved must be apprehended and punished.

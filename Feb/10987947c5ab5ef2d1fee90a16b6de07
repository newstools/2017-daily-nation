A teacher said to have beaten a pupil to death has been freed on a Sh100,000 bond after the prosecution failed to charge him. Prosecutors handling the case of Venezio Njuguna, the deputy headteacher of Mukandamia Primary School, said post-mortem results on the pupil had not been released. Mr Njuguna is suspected of beating and injuring Joy Waguthi on January 26, 2017 because she could not read. The pupil died days later. The case will proceed on March 17, 2017.   The 49-year-old Venezio Njuguna Maina was arrested at a hideout near his home in Chaka.

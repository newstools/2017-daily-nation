Football administrators are unable to make up their minds on the composition of this year’s SportPesa Premier League that is set to kick off next Saturday. The Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Appeals Committee on Thursday ruled against Muhoroni Youth and Sofapaka for failing to comply with the organisation’s club licensing regulations, effectively relegating the two top tier teams to the National Super League. The two clubs have vowed to challenge the decision in court. Football managers should ensure a timely resolution of such disputes. This will in turn encourage better management of the clubs themselves. A week to the opening of the league, fixtures are yet to be released, making it practically impossible for teams to prepare for their opening games. This contrasts sharply with other countries where fixtures are made public weeks in advance. Is it a surprise, then, that Kenya always performs poorly in football on the international scene? The tussle between clubs and administrators of the SportPesa Premier League does not augur well for Kenyan football and certainly does not instil confidence in the leadership of the FKF.

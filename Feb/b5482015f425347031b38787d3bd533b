Non-unionised teachers will start paying an agency fee for getting salary increases negotiated by the unions. Employment and Labour Relations Court Judge Nelson Abuodha ordered Labour Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie to gazette payment of an agency fee to the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet). Justice Abuodha said the deductions should be from June 21 last year to June this year and should start immediately. “That the order to last until then,” ruled the judge following an application by Kuppet on February 9. Statistics indicate that there are about 50,000 teachers who are not members of either Kuppet or the Kenya National Union of Teachers. Labour laws demand the deduction of agency fees from the salary of each unionisable teacher covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Since members of teachers’ unions contribute two per cent of their basic salary to the unions per month, non-members will now pay two per cent of their basic salary to Kuppet.

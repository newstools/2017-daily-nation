IN KINGSTON UPON HULL, UKKenya s SportPesa All Stars are all fired up for a potentially bruising match against a select side of English Premier League club Hull City Tigers on Monday.The match will be staged at the 25,000-capacity KCOM Stadium in Kingston upon Hull.Tickets to watch Hull City matches at KCOM usually go for about 30 (about Sh3,870), passes for this particular game will be sold at only 1 (Sh129) each. SportPesa All Stars assistant coach Patrick Naggi acknowledges the thick cloud of anxiety that currently hangs around the players, and advised them to churn out a performance that would reflective on their quality as Kenya s best footballers. If these players go there with the mentality that they are playing an English Premier League team they will not do anything at all. That is why I have asked them to forget about the opponent and the sideshows that this game brings with it and just concentrate on giving their best. That way they will be able to concentrate and who knows, one or two of them may remain behind and get a deal of a lifetime from the team, he said. His sentiments were echoed by revered old boy Dean Windass, who was part of the team that took the players through the media response training on Friday morning here in Hull. These boys have not come here to lose. Hull City players will not go into the match to get beaten. It is going to be a great match to watch by all means. I would just like to tell the players to forget the moment and think only about the game and nothing else because if they start to think about the moment then they will not be able to play the game, said Windass, a Hull City club ambassador. email print email print Leaders accuse senator of belittling DP by interfering in Jubilee s affairs.

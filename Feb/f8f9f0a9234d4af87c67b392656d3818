Four terror suspects arrested Friday night in a police operation in Mombasa have been remanded for 21 days. They will be held by police pending investigations. Shanzu Principal Magistrate Diana Mochache remanded Nasra Hyder, Salim Rashid, Aisha Hyder and Fatuma Rashid after an application by the prosecution. Ms Mochache said prosecutors had established compelling reasons to warrant the detention of the suspects while noting that investigating terrorism is a complex issue. “Terrorism is like a chain link and a cobweb, it takes time to investigate every chain,” said the magistrate. She also directed the investigating officer to ensure the suspects get basic needs while in remand, such as change of clothes. The four will be held at Port, Mtwapa, Bamburi and Nyali police stations. In her application, prosecution counsel Berryl Marinda told the court that Ms Nasra and Mr Salim were intercepted at the Syria-Turkey border. Ms Marinda said the two are suspected to be Islamic State (ISIS) sympathisers. Defence lawyer Teresa Mwangeka opposed the remand application, saying it is prejudicial for the prosecution to label the suspects as ISIS sympathisers.   The OCPD said police are yet to establish the suspects' plans.

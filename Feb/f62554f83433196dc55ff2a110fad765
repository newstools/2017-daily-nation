Police in Nairobi shot dead three suspected robbers early Friday morning. Police seized an AK-47 rifle, several license plates, a pistol, a magazine and several rounds of ammunition from the suspects. Another suspect that police said was armed escaped during the 3am shooting in Tena estate, dropping a magazine loaded with three rounds of ammunition. Police said officers on patrol in Kayole had earlier asked the suspects to stop when they noticed that they were behaving suspiciously, but they defied the orders and the officers alerted their colleagues in Buruburu. The suspects' silver Toyota Axio, registration number KBC 879L, was again stopped in Buruburu but on realising that they were driving into a trap, they tried to escape, shooting at police officers on Manyanja Road. The three died in the shootout that also resulted in the injury of an officer attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations office in Buruburu. The officers seized a Tokalev pistol, a motor vehicle, several vehicle ignition keys, seven motor vehicle switches, four mobile phones, cash and other items. Buruburu OCPD Geoffrey Maiyek said the identities of the suspects were unknown as they had no identification documents on them.   They find four guns, two homemade pistols and several rounds of ammunition.

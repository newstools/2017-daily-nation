A group of residents in Kisumu stormed a building housing Governor Jack Ranguma's office, grabbed his adviser and frog-marched him out on claims that he was preventing them from meeting with the county boss. They opted for political adviser Philip Ochieng after they failed to access the governor's office on the ninth floor, where Mr Ranguma was meeting with Kenya National Union of Teachers officials, led by Secretary-General Wilson Sossion at Prosperity House. The young people, who numbered about 30, said they were unhappy with the governorâ€™s leadership and blamed his political adviser for always barring them whenever they tried to reach him to express their complaints. They also accused the governor of favouritism. "The governor has ignored our plight for the past four years. He only gives tenders and jobs to his friends and clansmen from Kano. "Enough is enough. We will no longer sit back and watch as our rights are violated," explained Elvis Omondi, one of the youth leaders. Mr Ranguma cut short his meeting and fled. Later, the governor's representatives held a meeting with the youth and police officers. The building also houses a Huduma Centre, and the offices of the regional Administration Police boss and the Teachers Service Commission, among others.

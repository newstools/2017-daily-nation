Dear KitotoOne of the articles I benefited from was titled, Why should I bother to get married? published on October 16, 2016.You said that unlike what people say, marriage is pleasurable and stimulating, even though it requires hard work from both partners. You emphasised on openness and transparency as one of the most important key factors to a happier marriage, mutual submission, shared values and dreams, and mutual goals.I have learned that marriage is a relationship where two people must listen, compromise and respect each other. It is an arrangement that requires decisions to be made together. Listening, respecting and compromising go a long way towards keeping peace and harmony in a relationship. It is indeed true to say that marriage is a partnership of two unique people who bring out the best in each other and who know that even though they are okay as individuals, they are even better together.Thank you Pastor Kitoto for you have increased my knowledge and changed my perception on marriage. I am more positive about it.Your loving reader,Maureen. Hi Maureen,Thank you for being a regular reader of this column. I am delighted that the referred article helped you. Indeed, the factors you picked out are key to the building of a great relationship. What is saddening is that although many people know this, not many are faithful to their cultivation.

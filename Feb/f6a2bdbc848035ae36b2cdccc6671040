MADRID Ghanaian international Thomas Partey tied his long-term future to Atletico Madrid by extending his contract with the Spanish giants to 2022 on Tuesday. "Partey has renewed his contract with our club until 2022," Atletico said in a statement. "I am very happy and want to keep improving at Atletico," Partey told the club's website. Partey, 23, joined Atletico in 2011 and made his breakthrough into the first team last season after loan spells at Mallorca and Almeria. He has scored three goals in 31 appearances for Los Rojiblancos and was part of the Ghana side that reached the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations this month.

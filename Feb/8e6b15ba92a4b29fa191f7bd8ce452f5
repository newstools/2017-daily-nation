LOS ANGELES "The Lego Batman Movie" dominated the North American box office over the Presidents' Day weekend, industry data showed Tuesday, almost matching the combined haul of "Fifty Shades Darker" and "The Great Wall." Featuring the voice of Will Arnett as the caped crusader, the Warner Bros spinoff of the "The Lego Movie" took $42.7 million from Friday to Monday for a two-week total of $107.3 million, industry tracker Exhibitor Relations said. The 3D, computer-generated action comedy follows Batman as he tries to save Gotham City from being taken over by the Joker, voiced by Zach Galifianakis. Universal's second installment of the steamy "Fifty Shades" franchise based on the novels of E.L. James made $22.7 million for a total of $91.4 million while fantasy feature "The Great Wall" debuted at number three with a disappointing $21 million. Universal's lavish action thriller starring Matt Damon — filmed with a $150 million budget and billed as the first English-language production shot entirely in China — follows European mercenaries who get caught up defending the Great Wall of China against a group of monsters. Lionsgate's "John Wick: Chapter 2" dropped one spot to fourth place during its second weekend with $19 million in revenue for a two-week total of $61.2 million. The thriller stars Keanu Reeves as a hitman forced out of retirement in order to repay a debt to a fellow hired killer with whom he has signed a blood oath. "Fist Fight," another debut, came in fifth with $14.1 million for the three-day weekend. The comedy set at a school on senior pranks day follows a fired teacher played by Ice Cube, who challenges another teacher, Charlie Day, to an after-school fight. Rounding out the top 10 are: "Hidden Figures" ($9 million) "Split" ($8.5 million) "A Dog's Purpose" ($5.7 million) "La La Land" ($4.6 million) "A Cure for Wellness" ($4.4 million)

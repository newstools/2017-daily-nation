LONDON Manchester United's record goalscorer Wayne Rooney returned to training on Tuesday having missed the last four matches with a muscular injury. The 31-year-old forward — who became United's all-time goalscorer passing Bobby Charlton's tally of 249 when he scored against Stoke on January 21 — took part in the squad's last session before they fly to France for Wednesday's Europa League last 32 second leg clash with St Etienne. United — who will be without suspended midfielder Ander Herrera and the injured defender Phil Jones — won the first leg 3-0 part of a four match winning streak coinciding with Rooney's absence. Rooney - whom United manager Jose Mourinho said would not be sold despite reported interest from China as the club chases three Cups — trained in front of the media in a group also comprising Anthony Martial and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.   Bayern Munich coach Carlo Ancelotti will not be punished for showing Hertha Berlin fans his middle finger.

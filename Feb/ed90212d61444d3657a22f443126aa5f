Four opposition chiefs have signed an agreement creating a new political coalition, the National Super Alliance (Nasa). The agreement is largely a framework of operations and highlights seven key pillars under which the coalition's agenda will be anchored. The agreement did not contain any deal on power sharing or how to nominate a joint presidential candidate. The new alliance brings together the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), led by Raila Odinga, Wiper party, led by Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford-Kenya, led by Moses Wetang’ula, and Musalia Mudavadi’s Amani National Congress (ANC). While formalising the new alliance, the opposition leaders did not unveil any power-sharing agreement.   The two coalitions share the 3.7 million new voters registered at the end of the mass listing.

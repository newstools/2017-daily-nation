Some religious leaders have accused the Jubilee and the National Super Alliance (Nasa) leaders of dragging the country into election campaigns instead of addressing pressing issues facing Kenyans. The Council of Islamic Scholars of Kenya, Coast chapter has also accused both the government and opposition leaders of diving Kenyans along tribal lines and using vulgar language in their rallies. The council’s Coast representative Sheikh Abu Hamza called on both sides of political divide to end bickering and provide solutions into the water and food shortages caused by prolonged drought and address strikes by doctors and lecturers. The scholars cautioned that “the high political temperature” compounded by “escalating abusive, provocative language and incitement” is a recipe for election-related chaos and urged Kenyans to set aside their religious and tribal differences to avoid a repeat of the 2007/08 chaos. “Surprisingly we have allowed these people to run this country the way we want. They say once beaten twice shy and we all need to recall vividly what happened to this country in 2007 and 2008,” added Dr Abubakar Kher, a member of the council. Sheikh Abu Hamza called for suspension of all campaigns by Jubilee and Nasa leaders in pretext of mobilising citizens to register as voters saying all Kenyans are properly informed of their duty to register as voters. They also observed that some Kenyans are reluctant to register as voters due to endless failure by leaders to fix some of pressing issues facing the country. The scholars called on the media not to air any content where politicians will abuse each other during campaigns and live television programmes.

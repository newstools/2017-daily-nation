Kenya Ports Authority have signed up two promising teenagers to bolster the squad ahead of this season’s Kenya Volleyball Federation men’s league. The two are Matthews Kemboi, 17, a setter from St Patrick’s High School Iten and Migori High School alumnus Thomas Owuor, 19. Owuor is a left-handed right sided attacker. While confirming the arrival of the players, KPA’s team manager Joel Kosgei said that veteran player Mike Chemos who doubles up as the team’s coach, has also been registered to play in the new season after recovering from a niggling knee injury he suffered while in Japan early last year. “The medical team has given Chemos thumbs up to play. His addition alongside that of his youngsters gives us a clear chance of challenging for the title this season. Our performances last season show that we are capable of achieving that,” Kosgei said. KPA will also count on the services of veteran attacker Bernard Musumba, formerly of GSU, this season. Other players in their ranks are Nashon Biwott, David Thuita, Sunday Juma and Solomon Salberi.

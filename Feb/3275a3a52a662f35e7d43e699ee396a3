Holiday learning for teachers may be abolished, according to a report. Parallel university courses may be restructured, says the report by the Commission for University Education. It also recommends that honorary degrees be scrapped. The commission wants holiday learning, which enables teachers to pursue their studies during school breaks, to be replaced with part-time classes. The audit, conducted in both public and private universities, says holiday learning does not give teachers sufficient time to learn hence universities are producing half-baked graduates. The report has also proposed a change in strategy to curb the problem of missing marks in universities and to ensure supervision of doctorate degree students is done in a timely manner. Parallel degree courses, which have been blamed for the declining quality of university education, may also be reviewed. ESTABLISH SATELLITE CAMPUSES The courses have resulted in a rush by universities to establish satellite campuses to get more students. “We are concerned that some universities are admitting students without minimum entry requirements,” said Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i recently.“We are going to take difficult and painful decisions to restore order in university education. We cannot have people getting degrees without learning,” he added.The report will be released today at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development by Dr Matiang’i in an event that will be attended by vice-chancellors and principals of universities and colleges.The audit took place between January 23 and February following a directive by Dr Matiang’i to ensure universities comply with standards.

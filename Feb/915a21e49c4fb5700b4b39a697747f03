Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka has hit out at Ford Kenya leaders for terming the Rai Paper Mills project in Webuye a white elephant. Some leaders have alleged that the plant was grounded immediately after its relaunch by President Uhuru Kenyatta. But Mr Lusaka has called the allegations baseless and only meant to deceive locals for political reasons. He said those making the claims have not visited the plant to ascertain whether it is indeed grounded. “Their argument is baseless since it’s based on the fact that they have not seen smoke or smelled any wire from the plant like in the past. "The plant is operating on different technology,” he said. Saboti MP David Wafula said the leaders have been laying focus on cheap propaganda instead of being part of development initiatives. But separately, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa accused Mr Lusaka of deceiving locals “just to paint the Jubilee Party as pro-development yet it is clear that the plant is not functional”. “If they are claiming that plant has a smokeless and odourless technology, why are they not telling us who is working there because the firm was to offer job opportunities?” he posed.

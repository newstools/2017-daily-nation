Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has warned private developers against encroaching on school land. Speaking in Kisii Town Parish Catholic Church, Dr Matiang'i said the Ministry will protect all church-sponsored schools from land grabbers. The CS said such schools are susceptible to grabbers because most of them were built in the colonial era and hence have no title deeds. "Land grabbers should take note that the ministry is going to protect all schools in the country," he said. He urged politicians to help in resolving the issue, and not be a part of the problem. "It has been realised that leaders - especially politicians - have [been] associated with this problem and we are urging them to help us [end it]. "Where will our children go if leaders are the ones grabbing school land?‚Äù Dr Matiang'i added that the national government will aid schools acquire titles. "We are grateful that the national government has offered us support in this matter and we are going to work tirelessly to ensure that no land belonging to a school is grabbed," he said.

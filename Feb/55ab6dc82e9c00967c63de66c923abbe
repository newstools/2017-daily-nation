The government has given striking lecturers an offer, igniting hope for an end to their three-week work boycott at public universities. Prof Ratemo Michieka of the Inter-Public Universities Councils Forum on Tuesday said the lecturers had a counter-offer from the government. “We are waiting for their feedback once they are done with analysing the proposal, which is very good,” said Prof Michieka. However, he declined to disclose the contents of the counter-offer. The lecturers are set to meet with the forum on Wednesday for talks that many hope will lead to an agreement. On Tuesday, non-teaching staff held talks with the universities’ management and another meeting is scheduled for Thursday. “We will only talk of calling off the strike once we have seen this offer that the government is talking about,” said Universities Academic Staff Union Multimedia University chapter secretary-general Onesmus Mutio. Uasu chairman Muga K’Olale declined to discuss the offer with the media.

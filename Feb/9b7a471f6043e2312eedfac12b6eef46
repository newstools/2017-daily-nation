Governor Amason Kingi has told Kilifi residents not to vote for the Jubilee government, claiming that it was the cause of the problems that afflict them. Addressing a crowd at a public rally in Mwanamwinga, Kaloleni, after inspecting county projects, Mr Kingi said since Jubilee took power in 2013 the economy of Kilifi has suffered. The governor claimed that the national government had hatched various schemes to derail projects initiated by county government so as to indicate the county leaders are not performing. For instance, he mentioned delayed disbursement of funds as one of the ways that have crippled the completion of projects. "We know the Jubilee government well and we understand their tactics to delay various initiatives so that we are unable to carry [out] development projects in time. When that happens, they will again tell the people that we are not working," he said. Mr Kingi said, early this week, his administration received Sh200 million from the National Treasury, which is ironic because there are projects with estimated cost of Sh589 million. "We only received Sh200 million this week meant for development but we require a total of Sh589 million for our projects....when will these projects be completed?" he posed. The governor was responding to questions Mwanamwinga residents about why many projects had not been completed. "We only hear of some projects that your government is undertaking. When we go to other areas we see many water projects. What is happening in Mwanamwinga ward?" Selina Tsapi, Maendeleo ya Wanawake Organisation treasurer for Mwanamwinga sub location, asked. Kaloleni MP Gunga Mwinga urged the county administration to put in place measures that will deal with the ongoing drought. They toured the Ikanga dam project and the construction of a water pan at Kwa Ndhudhi village.

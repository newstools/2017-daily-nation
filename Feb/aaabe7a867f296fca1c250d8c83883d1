Six years ago, Wilson Kipsang stunned a press conference in Germany when he declared he was looking to break the world marathon record the following day on the streets of Frankfurt.Such open confidence isn t common among Kenyan runners, and Kipsang s declaration had tongues wagging in the German financial capital.But a few hours later, Kipsang went flat out and fell just four second shy of setting a new world record, running into the Festehalle finish in two hours, three minutes and 42 seconds, just outside compatriot Patrick Makau s then world record of 2:03:38The indefatigable police officer then went on to eventually break the world record with a brilliant 2:03:23 in the German political capital of Berlin two years later, only for his team-mate at Volare Sports management company, Dennis Kimetto, to throw down the gauntlet once again, shattering Kipsang s record and become the first man to dip under 2:03 with an amazing 2:02:57 on the same Berlin course 12 months later in 2014. Now, Kipsang has taken up the challenge again, and on Friday, he was at his usual confident best when he announced at a pre-race press conference that he will run a new world record 2:02:50 in Sunday s Tokyo Marathon!What makes his latest world record attempt more interesting is the fact that, while training for Sunday's race that starts at 3:30am (Kenyan time, live on SuperSport), he has also been busy rallying Elgeyo-Marakwet locals to register as voters.Because he will be running for the Keiyo South Parliamentary seat at August s General Election, one of his three main races this season besides Sunday s world attempt and a stab at a late year, big city marathon, probably in Chicago or New York. I m really excited and looking forward to running in this year s Tokyo Marathon, Kipsang, who improved his PB to 2:03:13 in finishing second behind Eliud Kipchoge in Berlin last year, said in Tokyo on Friday as race director Tad Hayano gleefully looked on.Meanwhile, Kipsang s Keellu Resort in Iten will be on all night vigil awaiting the 3:30am start of the Tokyo race on Saturday with deejays Calz and Magdee along with MCs The Teacher and ZK keeping revellers on toes as they watch Kipsang s world record attempt in the wee hours. The Tokyo course has been altered slightly to make it faster, and the stellar field should provide impetus for Kipsang with former winner Dickson Chumba, Bernard Koech, Evans Chebet, Marius Kipserem, Bernard Kipyego, Alfers Lagat, Gideon Kipketer and Geoffrey Rono completing the stellar Kenyan cast.Lucy Kabuu, a 2:19 runner, Sarah Chepchirchir and debutante Betsy Saina will take the Kenyan battle to a strong Ethiopian contingent of Birhane Dibaba (second in 2014), Amane Beriso (second in Dubai last year) and Amane Gobena who finished behind Kenyan winner Helah Kiprop in Tokyo last year. email print email print Mr Pkosing said Jubilee, with or without Kanu, will still win the polls.

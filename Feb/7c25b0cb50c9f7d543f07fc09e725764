Over 260 internally displaced persons residing in Subukia want to be enjoined in a contempt case in which ten women seek to revoke their settlement on Ndonga farm by the government. In a suit filed in 2013, the ten women, led by Ms Irene Kanyi, accused the government of contempt after it settled the 2007/2008 post-election violence victims on the 750-acre piece of land against court orders issued in 2011. The women, who are claiming ownership of the expansive farm, want the court to return to them the land, which was allegedly sold to the government by their brother. Through their lawyer, Mr Steve Biko Osur, the women denied having been involved in any transaction with the government for the sale of the piece of land. DECISION TO AFFECT LIVES In their application at the lands court in Nakuru, the IDPs have requested to be enjoined in the case saying the court’s decision will impact on their lives. “We seek to be involved in the case as the decision of the court will greatly affect our lives,” they said through their lawyer. The IDPs also say they have settled in the farm which they now recognise as their home. But according to the ten women seeking tom remove them, the government acquired the land fraudulently without following the right procedures. “My clients have never agreed to sell a piece of land to the government and believe that there was fraud in the whole process,” said Mr Osur. The court heard that the government totally disregarded court orders and went ahead to settle, allocate and subdivide the land to the IDPs. The case was adjourned until March 3, 2017.   The IDPs have said that it has taken the court too long to settle the matter.

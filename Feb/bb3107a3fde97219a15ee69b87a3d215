The government is set to roll out a fish-caging project in Bondo and Rarieda sub-counties as part of a plan to revive the industry. Principal Secretary for Arts and Culture Joe Okudo, while addressing 30 representatives of youth groups and co-operative societies from the sub-counties on Wednesday in Nairobi, said the project has won acclaim from experts as a sure method of sustainable exploitation of fishery resources. "This project is going to transform the living standards of the fishing community and will also help the fishermen end their usual wild-chase use of nets, hooks and lines and refocus their efforts on a predictable cycle of yield-guaranteed and low-cost fish caging," Mr Okudo said. The PS added that representatives of the groups have agreed to form an umbrella society to co-manage the fish-caging project alongside the State Department of Arts and Culture and the Lake Basin Development Authority. It is anticipated that there will be two fish cages for every 50 members of a society. Meanwhile, Mr Okudo said the government has begun fulfilling its pledge of rebuilding a music band, Boyieta ‘Ohangla’ Boys Band, whose nine members perished following a boat tragedy in Lake Victoria last year.

"The director of PPMC, Donald Otoyo, has developed a training module to ensure you get back on your feet and do so as the standard bearers for quality delivery of ‘ohangla’ music in Kenya,” the PS said. The boat, which was ferrying 17 artistes, capsized en route to Ndenda Island in Siaya County from Lihunda beach in Bondo on June 25.

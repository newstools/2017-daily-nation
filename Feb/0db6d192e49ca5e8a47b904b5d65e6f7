Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed the show of unity by leaders of the National Super Alliance (Nasa). The deputy president has said the opposition chiefs only want to remove the Jubilee administration in order to get power but not to develop the country. Addressing a rally in Kaloleni, Kilifi County, on Wednesday, Mr Ruto said the opposition leaders are only interested in sharing political seats. He said that unlike the Jubilee Party, which he said is keen on developing the country and had the interests of Kenyans at heart, Nasa is only keen on sharing positions. "The difference between Jubilee and the opposition is as clear as day and night. While Jubilee is for [the] development of the country, our competitors are only good [at] empty rhetoric and organising demonstrations," he said. The deputy president urged Coast residents to join Jubilee and re-elect its leaders during the August polls. JUBILEE CANDIDATE He vouched for Kisao Kahindi, an aspirant for the Kaloleni constituency seat, to be the Jubilee candidate. "Mr Kisao should join MPs Gideon Mung'aro and Mustafa Iddi to make a formidable team to enable Jubilee win in Kilifi," he said. Although Mr Iddi and Mr Mung'aro were elected on ODM tickets, they have since defected to Jubilee. On Wednesday, the two said Jubilee belongs to Coast residents, has a national outlook and has helped develop the region. They accused Nasa leaders of having nothing to show for their years in government. Mr Ruto hit out at Kilifi Governor Amazon Kingi, saying he had failed to work with the Jubilee administration to develop the county. He enumerated government projects in Kilifi and promised locals more goodies including roads, water and electricity.   Opposition leaders are expected to tour Meru, Embu and Tharaka Nithi to drum up support of Nasa.

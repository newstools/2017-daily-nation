ODM leader Raila Odinga has told residents of Tharaka-Nithi County to support the National Super Alliance (Nasa) in the coming elections, promising them that they will get State jobs if the coalition takes over power. Mr Odinga was speaking Tuesday during a meeting at Marimanti with leaders from the county. He was accompanied by Mr Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Mr Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Ford Kenya’s Moses Wetang’ula. Mr Odinga said they will deploy monitors in all polling stations to ensure there is no rigging during the August 8 elections. He also welcomed Senator Kithure Kindiki's elder brother, Prof Isiaih, to the coalition. Prof Isiaih says he does not agree with his brothers political ideologies and hence his decision to support the opposition. RIGGING CLAIMS On his part, Mr Mudavadi challenged the electoral commission to come clean on its preparations for the elections. Mr Mudavadi alleged that IEBC is planning to use advanced technology to rig the elections. "This time round there is no room for theft. Our strength lies in Nasa," he said. Speaking at the same function, Mr Musyoka said it is time for the Tharaka people to leave the Gema grouping saying that as a community, they have suffered enough. However, Mr Musyoka said the Nasa coalition is yet to convince people from the county popularly referred to as “the stronghold" to vote for them. At the same time, Mr Wetang'ula said Tharakas are not an appendage of their Meru neighbours. “We want an equal society where all communities are treated the same way," Mr Wetang’ula said. He said Nasa will change the bad history of leadership in Kenya and restore its glory.   Mr Odinga addresses locals at Timau bus stage in Burri Sub-County on first day of tour.

A nine-month-old baby has drowned after falling into a bucket of water as the mother did her laundry in Mathare, Nairobi County. The woman told police that she left the girl sleeping on their bed on Wednesday and went outside to wash clothes. She returned to the house 25 minutes later and found the baby had fallen into a 20-litre bucket of water. “The baby was rushed to Marura nursing home but was pronounced dead on arrival,” police said. In another incident, a man was found dead in a trench on Jogoo Road, a day after heavy rains pounded Nairobi. The incident was reported by members of the public on Wednesday morning. “The body was pulled out of a trench that seemed to have overflowed with water. The body had no visible injuries,” the police report said. Police estimated the victim was aged 26 years and the body was taken to City Mortuary as police work to identify him.

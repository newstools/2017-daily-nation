The 2010 World Half Marathon champion Florence Kiplagat might have won her fourth Barcelona Half Marathon title on Sunday, but she failed in her bid to break the two-day old world half marathon record when she clocked 1 hour, 08 minutes and 15 seconds. On Friday, Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir won Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) Half Marathon in 1:05:06, lowering Kiplagat’s previous record of 1:05:06 from 2015 Barcelona Half Marathon by three seconds. Many held their breath as Kiplagat sought to reclaim the record she had broken twice - in 2014 and 2015 - but the windy course in the Spanish city made it impossible for the 2011 and 2013 Berlin Marathon champion. It’s Kiplagat, the reigning Chicago Marathon champion, who broke her compatriot Mary Keitany’s three-year-record of 1:05:50 from 2011 RAK Half Marathon with an explosive record-break feat of 1:05:12 at Barcelona Half Marathon in 2014. Kiplagat would better the world record in a new time of 1:05:09 on the same course in 2015. However, last year, Kiplagat, 29, failed to break the world record on her third attempt but was happy to have claimed a hat-trick running a relatively modest season’s best of 1:09:19. That gave Jepchirchir a chance for the stunning victory in United Arab Emirates on Friday. Kiplagat, who seemingly had an easy affair, trounced Portuguese European half marathon bronze medallist Jessica Augusto to second din 1:10:36 as Sara Hall from United States sealed the last podium place in 1:11:19. The 2010 Cologne Half Marathon champion Leonard Lagat won men’s race in 1:00:52, beating compatriot Meshak Koech to second by two seconds in 1:00:54 while another Kenyan, Joel Kimurer, came third in 1:00:59.    Two-time World Marathon champion Abel Kirui came in fourth in 1:01:30. The women’s World record could come under threat once again with one of the finest fields heading for Lisbon Half Marathon on March 19.   Kiplagat is intent on securing a position in the Kenya team for the 2017 championship.

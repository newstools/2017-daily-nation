Former Journalist Anderson Ojwang' has lit up campaigns for Karachuonyo parliamentary seat following his donations of match boxes bearing his campaign details. Mr Ojwang', a former bureau chief with the Standard Media Group in Kisumu thrilled locals when he appeared for campaigns with branded match boxes urging them to register as voters and elect him as MP in the coming elections. A resident, Martin Shikuku, said Mr Ojwang's modest campaign style had amazed locals whom he said pledge to elect the youthful businessman. "They say it is better to vote in a genuine and frank aspirant rather than a rich man flashing money with questionable sources," Mr Shikuku said. Mr Ojwang' said even though some people view his donation of match boxes as "too simple", the move had touched many families. "They say you cannot cook your best meal without fire and am offering them an option. My slogan remains Osemoke oliel (Itâ€™s been lit and it's burning up)," Mr Ojwang' told Nation.co.ke. He is seeking to unseat philanthropist MP James Rege who has since defected to Jubilee party. Mr Ojwang' said he will vie on an Orange Democratic Movement party ticket.

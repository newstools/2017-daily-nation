Mbeere South MP Mutava Musyimi has recommended shared democracy between members of the dominant Mbeere and Kamba communities in the coming elections. Mr Musyimi suggested that either side can produce a deputy governor or an MP, which will enhance inclusivity. "There [has] to be a give and take. If the MP is from Mwea, the deputy governor should be from the Mbeere side so that people feel included in the whole process. "It is not good for both seats to go to one side. We must have dialogue over the issue," he said. The Kamba community is dominant in Mwea and Makima wards while Mbeeres are concentrated in Mavuria, Mbeti South and Kiambere wards. Speaking at Kirima Secondary School during the constituencyâ€™s prize-giving day, Mr Musyimi called on residents to elect leaders based on merit and not on their tribe affiliations. Mr Musyimi said he turned down an invitation from Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka to join the opposition party. During a tour of the region last week, Mr Musyoka had claimed that there was a plot to deny Mr Musyimi the Jubilee ticket since Mwea people, where the MP hails from, voted overwhelmingly for Raila Odinga for president in the 2013 elections. The legislator will be defending his seat on August 8 on a Jubilee Party ticket. He said he supports the re-election of the party's head, President Uhuru Kenyatta, because his constituents have gained from his leadership. "That is very kind of him, but I am happy where I am. When we fought for democracy, we wanted people to have the opportunity to vote for and join the [parties] of their choice," Mr Musyimi said.

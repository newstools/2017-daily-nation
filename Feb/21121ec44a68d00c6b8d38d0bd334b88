Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has castigated the Jubilee administration for not stamping out runaway insecurity in the county. Speaking at Mochongoi in Baringo South on Friday, Mr Moi said the residents are entitled to protection by the government, calling on President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to do so. The senator said he will meet elders from warring Pokot and Tugen communities to end perennial conflict. Tension remains high at Kapkechir village in Baringo South after a raid by suspected members of the Pokot community on Wednesday that left two people nursing bullet injuries. The armed bandits also torched 52 houses and stole dozens of livestock during the 4pm incident. He urged the residents who had fled following the attack to return. Further, he told the government to compensate victims of cattle rustling.

He said the chairman of the parliamentary security committee, Tiaty MP Asman Kamama, should address the matter. The senator vowed to push for more Kenya Police Reservists (KPRs) to be deployed at the hotspots. Baringo South assistant county commissioner Michael Gakinya raised concern over the rising number of herders with illegal firearms. Some of the areas where locals have fled are Kapkechir, Lomoiywe and Chebinyiny. Schools such as Kapkechir primary, and three others, remain closed.

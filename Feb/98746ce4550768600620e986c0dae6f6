Leonard Barsoton from Kenya Police stunned teammate World and defending champion Geoffrey Kamworor to win the men's 10km National Cross Country Championships title on Saturday at Uhuru Gardens. Barsoton, the 2014 Africa Cross Country champion, swung to the lead with two laps to go and never looked back to win the race on his third attempt in 28:56.3. World Cross Country silver medallist Bedan Karoki rallied from seventh place to finish second in 29:02.3 as Kamworor, the World Half Marathon champion, came in third in 29:03.4 to complete Kenya Police's podium places sweep. Barsoton had finished second behind Karoki in 2014 and third behind Karoki and Kamworor in 2015. Barsoton also came in third behind winner Kamworor and Karoki in 2016. "It's a sweet victory having played second fiddle to Kamworor and Karoki three times. I thank God," said Barsoton. "It now gives me hope for a World title, having beaten the World champion and silver medallist."   Barsoton is confident of winning the World title as he goes back to Kampala on March 26, a place where he won the Africa Cross Country title in 2014.Karoki will however not compete at the World Cross Country opting to give his chance to other athletes. Kamworor, who was competing for the first time since Rio Olympic Games, said he is slowly regaining his form having just resumed training in December. "My body feels great and I should regain full form before the Kampala race," said Kamworor, the World 10,000m silver medallist.

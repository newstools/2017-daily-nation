Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to ban politicians who fan violence from vying. Governor Mutua said the country's peace is a priority that must be protected. "We wish to tell IEBC that we need peace in our country. Leaders causing chaos through spreading hate speech should not be allowed to vie," he said. Speaking on Saturday at Kianjai market in Meru, Dr Mutua said he and his Maendeleo Chap Chap party endorses President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election because he is a visionary and development-minded leader. However, he said his decision to back the President earned him criticism from various leaders. The governor urged the residents to eschew any activity that may disrupt harmony in the country. Also, Dr Kilemi Mwiria urged the locals to elect him as the next governor, which is also being contested by Meru Senator Kiraitu Murungi. Peter Munya is the incumbent. Dr Mwiria is vying via a Maendeleo Chap Chap party ticket. They later visited Laare and Timau to popularise the party.

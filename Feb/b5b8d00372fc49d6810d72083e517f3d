Disgruntled casual workers of the Nyandarua County government on Monday emptied faecal matter at the entrance of the county public service board offices, paralysing operations. The workers were protesting against alleged violation of a tripartite agreement between them, the county management and the board on promotions and confirmation. Earnest Macharia, the chairman of the Nyandarua county branch of the Kenya County Government Workers Union, said the workers would not resume their duties until they are served appropriately.   “We had an agreement with the county management board and the public service board that by the 19th of December our promotions and confirmations would have been issued. It has been more than two months now and nothing to show for it,” he said. The more than 100 workers, who camped at the offices, said they had been lied to by the government since its inception. They complained that some of their members seconded to the county government had not yet had their confirmation letters.   The protesting workers have been promised appointment letters for the past three years but that has not been forthcoming, they said. They complained that public service board secretary Jack Mbugua had been ignoring them. Efforts to reach Mr Mbugua were futile and he was said to be on leave. The workers camped at the offices hoping that an appointee of the governor’s office would resolve the issue.

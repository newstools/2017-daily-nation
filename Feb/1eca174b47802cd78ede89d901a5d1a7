A man has died in Wanyororo, Nakuru County after of the wall of a pit latrine he was working on collapsed, burying him alive. The father of two identified as Amos Kariuki, 25, was among four others who were working on the 30-feet deep latrine being built CDF when the incident occurred. His colleagues escaped unhurt in the Wednesday morning incident. The five were working on a concrete wall of the community latrine when it came tumbling and covered the pit. According to residents, the building of the latrine started more than five years ago and several contractors have worked on it and left it open without completing it. “The pit is in a marshy ground and so while the five were digging, a nearby wall caved in and came tumbling down covering the pit. “Four of them managed to escape while one remained trapped inside,” said Mr Julius Musau, a resident. NO ASSESSMENT Residents claimed the ground was not assessed before the construction begun, resulting in the incident that claimed the man’s life. “As area residents, we have been contributing towards the construction of the latrine even though we were not consulted before the exercise,” he said. Three years ago, according to the residents, a police officer fell into the pit and broke his legs and is still unable to walk. “It is until we called for the coving of the pit which has been open for years that the construction [started] again,” said Ms Esther Ng’endo. Confirming the incident, Nakuru North Police Boss Edward Wafula said the body was retrieved and taken to Nakuru County Hospital mortuary.

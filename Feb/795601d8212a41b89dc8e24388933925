Mugere, whose winning ticket was 40325358433, bagged the prize after playing 330 times and has hinted at expanding his business with the fortune from Lotto, one of Kenya’s most popular gaming programmes. Having began playing since Lotto started its operations in November, 2015, Mugere affirmed his commitment to Lotto saying he was glad that his long-term association with the firm paid off in a big way. A businessman for over five years, he understands that some returns come in the short run while others come in the long run. Mugere joins Ol Kalou-based farmer Geoffrey Kungu on the list of multi-millionaires with Kungu having struck the Sh100 million jackpot on New Year’s eve last December. In the latest draw, Mugera and his wife became Lotto’s 122nd and 123rd millionaires respectively. With his dream of winning the Lotto out of the way, Mugere now plans to focus on his family’s dreams and build a home in their own piece of land which he will purchase after consultations with his wife. Mugere also plans to expand his wife’s business along with his own.

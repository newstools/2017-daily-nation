The national men’s cricket team leaves for India on Monday for a series of friendly matches. The Kenyans will then cross over to Nepal for the ICC World Cricket League Championship. Kenya is currently placed fifth, with eight points from four wins and two losses in the eight-team league.They now must win all their remaining matches against Nepal, the Netherlands and Scotland to finish in the top four, which will guarantee them a place in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The bottom four teams will be relegated to Division Two, and will play the finalists of Division Three for the remaining two spots next year. While there is still hope, long term planning is required to get Kenya out of these minor leagues back to Associate membership with ODI and T20 Status. Cricket Kenya should take the bull by the horns and immediately set up the right structures for development.  Kenya needs a well-structured league to nurture quality players. That it’s only Nairobi that has a vibrant league goes without saying. The Nairobi league doesn’t really help much if at all some of its top players can’t make the national team due to politics, with the frequent wrangles not making it any better. Cricket Kenya really needs to define the path the game has to take, if the country is to regain its past glory. The situation is dire.

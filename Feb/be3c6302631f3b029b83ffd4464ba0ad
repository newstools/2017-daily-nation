Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has claimed the opposition is plotting to reduce the powers of a President by amending the Constitution. The minister alleged opposition leaders are discussing how they will share power if they win the August elections. “The National Super Alliance (NASA) team is sitting in boardrooms deliberating on how they can share power in the government. A government they are not working to build," he said. Mr Kiunjuri said the opposition is planning to change the law to have a ceremonial President with two deputies and a prime minister, who will serve as a loyalist leader and be the head of government. “They are plotting on how they take over power from Jubilee while instead they should be busy mobilising people to register,” said Mr Kiunjuri. He was speaking during a thanksgiving ceremony at Kanjuri Boys High School in Nyeri. He urged residents in central Kenya to register in large numbers, with 10 days remaining before the closure of the mass voter registration.

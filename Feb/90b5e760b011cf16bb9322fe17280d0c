Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki has denied accusations that development projects from the national government have been concentrated in Chuka Town through his influence. Addressing residents at Kirubia Stadium on Thursday, Prof Kindiki said he has made sure that the projects are evenly distributed in the three constituencies of Tharaka, Maara and Chuka/Igambang’ombe. He accused some local politicians of dividing residents by alleging that he has sidelined some regions in terms of development for political reasons. “I am not foolish to concentrate projects in one area because I know I am a leader of the whole county,” said Prof Kindiki. He said he has always made sure there is an ongoing road construction and irrigation project in the three constituencies and is looking for more projects. MEGA PROJECT FOR KATHWANA He added that that he is pushing for the speeding up of another mega sports project that will be established at the county headquarters in Kathwana. The senator has been facing criticism from Governor Samuel Ragwa and residents of Tharaka and Maara constituencies who claim that he has favoured Chuka/Igambang’ombe. Some of the projects that Mr Ragwa argues should have been established in Kathwana and not Chuka Town include the High Court, Huduma Centre and Kirubia Stadium among others. However, Prof Kindiki maintained that his opponents are wasting time inciting residents since his work can be seen and he will win with a landslide in the August 8 elections. He asked his competitor, Kiambi Kiriiro, to wait for another one term because in 2022 he will be running for presidency. “Those who want the senate seat should wait a little bit because in 2022 I will be battling it out with men and women from other parts of the country for the presidency,” he said. He maintained that he is not fearing anybody because he is sure of being re-elected.

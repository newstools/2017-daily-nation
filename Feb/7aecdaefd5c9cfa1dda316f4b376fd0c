"This is not only [a] campaign to clean the airwaves on TV and radios, but also to get rid of inappropriate content that is being played in restaurants, public service vehicles," he said. The chair advised musicians not to be fooled that only songs that carry explicit sexual content become popular. He also said the board will not bow down to detractors questioning its mandate of moral policing.

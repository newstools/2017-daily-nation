Five people from the same family died Friday in a crash at Landi on the Voi-Mwatate road while transporting a body to a burial in Wundanyi, Taita Taveta County. The crash involved a lorry and a matatu that was carrying the casket and mourners. Four people died on the spot while the fifth one died in hospital. Eight other people suffered injuries and were being treated at St Joseph Shelter of Hope Hospital in Voi. Those who died included four men and a woman, who are close relatives of the deceased woman whose body was being transported for burial. Family members said the husband and father-in-law of the deceased are among those who died. “We were waiting for the body to arrive for burial today (Friday) and this incident has shocked us,” said Rachel Mbatia, a relative. The six bodies, including the one in the coffin, were then moved to the Moi County Referral Hospital mortuary in Voi. Some of the family members revealed that there had been a wrangle between the deceased woman's family and that of her husband on where to bury the body. The woman's family had demanded to bury her, saying her husband had not paid dowry. They said the two parties finally agreed on where the woman would be laid to rest. County commander Fred Ochieng urged drivers to be extra careful while driving along unmarked roads.

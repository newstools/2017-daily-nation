Nairobi County nurses’ union has called on its members to turn up on Wednesday for a mass demonstration after the Salaries and Remuneration Commission rejected their collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The procession by the nurses will start in Uhuru Park at 9am, head to Afya House, the SRC offices then end in Westlands at the Council of Governors Office. Speaking to the Nation, the Kenya Union of Nurses Nairobi branch secretary general Eunice Ngari said that they are expecting all nurses to show solidarity by coming out in large numbers to demand for their rights. “We will hold a peaceful demonstration…we are inviting even our friends from the neighbouring counties to join us in the walk,” said Ms Ngari. Nairobi County has employed over 1,600 nurses based in various city hospitals including Mama Lucy Hospital, Mbagathi Hospital, Mutuini hospital and Pumwani Maternity. NOTHING TO DO The Nairobi County Executive for health Bernard Muia said that the standoff is beyond the county and that it can do nothing to end the strike. “Health care providers should never participate in strikes, they should negotiate and dialogue while still working. The effect of them striking is dire to the society,” said Dr Muia. Dr Muia added that operations in county health facilities had not been completely paralysed as doctors and clinical officers were offering emergency, inpatient and outpatient services. He said that nurses in charge of health facilities and those on managerial positions are still at work. However Ms Ngari said that those who are still at work cannot sustain the pressure of the job that the nurses do. Ms Ngari said that both clinical officers and doctors cannot operate without the nurses hence the need for the government to Fast-track the signing of the CBA.

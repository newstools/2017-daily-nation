The High Court has referred to the Chief Justice a case challenging the awarding of a ballot printing tender to a Dubai firm. Justice George Odunga on Friday asked CJ David Maraga to appoint a three-judge bench to hear and determine the matter. PRINTING He noted that the matter raises weighty issues touching on the Constitution and fair administration of justice, and is also of great public interest and should be urgently determined. The case filed by the National Super Alliance will be heard on Tuesday next week and parties are required to file their responses expeditiously. Judge Odunga, however, declined to stop the execution of the tender awarded to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing. He also directed that presidential candidate Ekuru Aukot, the Attorney-General and the Jubilee Party be enjoined in the suit.  More follows.   IEBC awarded the Dubai firm tender to print ballot papers for six elective positions.

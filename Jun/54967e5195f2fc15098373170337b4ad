ACCRAGhanaian international defender Samuel Inkoom has been banned from all football-related activity for a year, world governing body Fifa said on Saturday.The 28-year-old, who plays for Bulgarian club FC Vereya, was punished "for refusing to pay compensation due to his former agent", Fifa said in a statement.Inkoom was ordered to pay agent Andy Evans based on an agreement between the two parties."The ban remains in effect until Mr. Inkoom pays the full amount due to his former agent," Fifa added.Inkoom was already fined by Fifa in December 2014 over the affair, with the player then failing in his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).Inkoom reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana in 2010 and the quarter-finals of that year's World Cup. email print email print

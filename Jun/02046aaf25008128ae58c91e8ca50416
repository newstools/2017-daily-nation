President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto have defied their key financiers and disgruntled former Jubilee politicians now running as independents in their push for key numbers in Parliament.But for the Jubilee duo, theirs will be a battle against a new political animal threatening to eat into their bastions and support ahead of the high-stakes August 8 election.

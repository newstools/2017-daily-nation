The World Under-18 Athletics Championships Local Organising Committee has said it is determined to host a successful championship next month in Nairobi. Speaking on Tuesday at Shanzu Teachers College in Mombasa, the Local Organising Committee’s Chief Executive Officer, Mwangi Muthee, said his team will ensure Kenya is strictly represented by youth, adding that they have put measures in place to ensure this is achieved. Muthee also said his committee has come up with creative ways to ensure youngsters drawn from all the 47 counties attend the championships set to run from July 12-16 at the Safaricom Stadium in Nairobi. Muthee was speaking during the opening ceremony of this year’s secondary schools Term Two ‘A’ national games where he was the chief guest. The games will also feature athletics. Muthee said already, 130 countries globally have confirmed participation at the games, adding that the number might increase to 150 by the time the championship begins. “This will be like a World Cup for Kenya because the whole world will be here and all eyes will be looking at us. We expect it to be huge and that’s the reason why we want as many youngsters as possible to come and meet their peers from other parts of the World,” Muthee said. Muthee said his team has come up with incentives to attract youngsters to the championships. Local schools that will plant indigenous trees in groups of 50 will get 50 tickets for their students and five for their teachers to enable them watch the games. The national trials for the championship will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Nairobi. Muthee said there will also be incentives for those who will attend the championships in traditional attire. “We want to take opportunity to show the world our rich culture."   In total, Muthee said they have spent Sh36.8 million on Team Kenya's preparations.

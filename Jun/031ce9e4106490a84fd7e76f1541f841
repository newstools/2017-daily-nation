The Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) Judicial Appeal Panel on Saturday dismissed the seven-month ban handed to Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) coach Curtis Olago and called for a fresh hearing. The Judicial Panel had banned Olago for seven months and two weeks after it found the tactician guilty of assaulting referee Mwangi Karimi in September last year, following a dispute from a Kenya Cup match in April. KCB lodged a successful appeal on behalf of Olago on Thursday before KRU convened a session on Saturday under Appeal Panel headed by Edward Rombo. Olago, KCB team manager Ronnie Kangeta and secretary John Ojara attended the hearing that had CEO Ronald Bukusi and Martin Ngunjiri from KRU. “It’s a good thing that the ban was dismissed and we hope the fresh hearing will be conducted by an independent panel,” said Ojara. “We are waiting for the official ruling from the appeal hearing for us to know if the fresh hearing will be on Saturday." Ojara said it will be important for the hearing to take place next Saturday since KCB will be leaving on on June 29 for a tour of South Africa.   The appeal will be heard on Saturday.

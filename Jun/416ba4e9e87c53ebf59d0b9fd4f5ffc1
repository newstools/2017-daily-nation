Five young people have been arrested in connection with the murder of businessman Elias Kalama in Nyamalani village in Kinango constituency. Kinango OCPD Frederick Lai said the suspects were picked up following a tip and are still in custody. All the suspects are related to the slain man and are aged between 17 and 22 years. “Family feuds could be the reason for the murder, but we are still investigating the incident,” said the OCPD. Mr Kalama was attacked at his Nyamalani Village farm at around 1am on Monday. “Unknown people cut his throat with a sharp panga after hitting him once on the head with an axe,” he said. BURIED Family sources said the farmer was in the company of one of the suspects that night. The suspect is alleged to have alerted the other members of the gang once Mr Kalama fell asleep and they attacked. Mr Lai said an axe and a panga believed to have been used in the crime were seized. The family source said two of the suspects are nephews of Mr Kalama, one is a cousin while two others are uncles. Police also said they are exploring the possibility that the youth were hired by another person to kill the businessman. Mr Kalama was buried on Wednesday at his Nyamalani home. Former area assistant county commissioner Mwatela Kamanza and area county assembly member Musa Ahmed and a host of political aspirants and administrators attended the burial.

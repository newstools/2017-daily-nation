According to Siaya county IEBC Returning Officer Ms Ruth Kulundu, the decision was made after a meeting between the electoral agency officials and the county security team following heightened tension. Ms Kulundu was speaking to journalists after presiding over a meeting with aspirants in the county. She said that the directive takes effect from Saturday, July 1 and will be lifted on July 6. "With powers bestowed on me by the Constitution as the county Returning Officer I have decided to suspend the ongoing campaigns until the tension eases on the ground," said Ms Kulundu. VIOLATE Ms Kulundu was accompanied by County Commissioner Josephine Onunga, County Police Commander Beatrice Gachago. The Returning Officer warned any candidate who violates the directive will be barred from participating in the August elections. "This directive is final, and any candidate who will be found violating this directive will be committing an electoral offence which attracts a hefty fine," she said. Ms Kulundu also asked the politicians to ask their supporters to desist from acts of defacing and pulling down campaign materials for their opponents, using abusive languages, burning of opponents’ effigies and engaging in violence. "This is my verbal warning and I expect all the aspirants to adhere to it as we monitor the situation on the ground. We will lift the ban if things get back to normal and enforce the ban if the situation remains the same,” she said.

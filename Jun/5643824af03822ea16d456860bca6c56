Veterinary officers in Nakuru vaccinated dogs against rabies, following cases of attacks on humans. The dogs were vaccinated in Moto village, Kuresoi North. In the latest incident last week, a stray dog attacked four people in the village putting them at risk of contracting rabies. DISEASE OUTBREAKAddressing journalists, Dr Peter Mwangi, a veterinary officer, said the exercise will prevent an outbreak of the disease. "Any victim of a dog bite should be treated immediately since the bite can easily cause death," Dr Mwangi said Friday. He also advised dog owners to immunise their dogs regularly. "Mature dogs should be vaccinated once a year while younger dogs receive the vaccine twice a year." COST OF VACCINE Dr Josephat Karoki, also a veterinarian, said the county would cater for the treatment of victims. Ms Beatrice Wanja, whose son was bitten, thanked the officers for treating her son for she could not afford the anti-rabies vaccine, which costs Sh1800. "I was treating the wounds using traditional medicine at home. I was not aware that a dog bite can turn deadly if not treated immediately," Ms Wanja said.

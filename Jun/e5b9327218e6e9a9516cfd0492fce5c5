Regional aviation firm Safarilink is on July 1 set to launch weekly flights to Zanzibar Island. The airline, which is mostly known as a tourist destination carrier, will operate the flights from Wilson Airport Nairobi. Safarilink head of sales and marketing Hamisi Mwanundu said four weekly flights would be available on Monday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. “We thought it wise to provide a new solution and supplement what we already have due to demand the service from our agents and clients,” he said. “Our first direct flight on July 1, to Zanzibar will not be a commercial one but an inaugural one. We will start commercially on July 3.” This comes months after the regional airline launched daily flights to Kitale starting last November from Wilson Airport on a Beech1900 aircraft, which carries a maximum of 19 passengers.

Mr Mwanundu said they have been providing flight extensions to some of their tourist passengers to Zanzibar, which has proven cumbersome. “Those passengers who have been going to Zanzibar before have been forced to go through the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Kilimanjaro in Tanzania then on to Zanzibar, but now we are providing them with an alternative,” he said.

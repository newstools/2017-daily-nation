Nigerian artiste Burna Boy is in trouble over copyright infringement. According to a Nigerian creative studio called Insecta, Burna Boy used some of their work without compensating them.Part of the statement that Insecta issued reads: Towards the end of last year, we made it public that Burna Boy and Aristokrat had taken our artistic work and used it in South Africa for Burna s performance at Essence Concert without paying or giving us any form of credit, It continued: ...Letting this slide would only give them more grounds to keep taking advantage of our sweat without acknowledging or truly understanding the value of what we give So we decided to just do it. Yesterday, we filed a N20 million suit at the Federal High Court against Burna Boy and Aristokrat for copyright infringement. However, Burna Boy s management has denied claims that the Pree Me musician has been sued saying they haven t sued Burna Boy. This is defamation of character, it has nothing to do with Burna, it happened in South Africa. At the same time, there have also been reports that Burna Boy has been banned from performing in the USA and Canada. He was allegedly sued by a promotion company, Vibesland Entertainment, LLC, for failing to turn up for a tour for which he had already signed a contract. email print email print

Jamaican musician Sean Paul has called out rapper Drake for failing to give credit to the dancehall genre which has contributed to part of his success.Speaking to Metro UK, the hit maker did not shy away from calling out the Controlla rapper because some of his songs have been influenced by dancehall music. I think at the time when it was popping off, it would have been good for him [Drake] to actually put accolades towards the whole culture. [Drake is] friendly with a few people in the business in Jamaica and that s good, I love it, he continues. But if he had given more accolades when he was actually making it and said this is the music I love, it would have been cool. Paul singled out Ed Sheeran s massive hit Shape of You saying that it was influenced by Island music. email print email print

At least 123 people were killed and scores injured in central Pakistan early Sunday when a fire erupted after crowds rushed to collect fuel from an overturned oil tanker. Here are the most serious such incidents around the world over the past decade. In many of the most deadly of these, people were trying to recover spilt fuel and were caught in the subsequent fire.   Pakistan has an appalling record of fatal traffic accidents due to poor roads.

CAPE TOWNAs Cape Town suffers its worst drought in a century, residents have been told to restrict showers to two minutes and flush toilets only when "absolutely necessary".The city South Africa's biggest tourist hotspot and the surrounding Western Cape Province have been declared a disaster area by the local government, with just 10 percent of usable water left in the dams supplying the area.DESERTTwo hours from the city, Theewaterskloof Dam, the main source of water for Cape Town, has been reduced to a flat and sandy desert, with the petrified remains of orchards flooded when the dam was built in the 1970s standing starkly under the sun.At the local watersports club, exposed moorings reveal where sailboats once floated.People queue up to collect drinking water from taps that are fed by a spring in Newlands in Cape Town on May 15, 2017.

The dam has less than 20 per cent of its water capacity.

That's the scary bit."A man collects drinking water from taps that are fed by a spring in Newlands in Cape Town on May 15, 2017.

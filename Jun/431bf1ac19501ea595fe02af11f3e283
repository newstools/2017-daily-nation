He will also compete in the 4x400m relays.TO COMPETE IN OSLOAfter the nationals, Nyairera intends to compete at the Oslo Diamond League on June 15 before returning for the World Championships trials on June 23-24 at Nyayo Stadium.

My endurance is superb and the short races are part of my speed work. I have realised that I run out of gas in the last 200m, said Nyairera, who finished second behind Olympic and World champion Caster Semenya in Doha and Eugene. I started by preparations in February and I think things could have been different if I started much earlier in December, said Nyairera.Also in the Prisons team for the nationals are the 400m hurdles national champion Maureen Jelagat, who has just arrived from Germany, and Africa and All Africa Games 10,000m champion Alice Aprot, who is also the World Cross Country silver medallist.World Under-20 1,500m champion Kumari Taki will battle it out for Prisons in 800m while Africa 5,000m silver medallist Wilfred Kimitei will compete in his specialty.Kiprop will lead said he has fully recovered after a bout of flu that saw him finish a distant seventh at Prefontaine Classic on May 27. I took some strong antibiotic on the eve of the race and the morning which really weakened my body, said Kiprop. But I am okay now and ready for the national championships.

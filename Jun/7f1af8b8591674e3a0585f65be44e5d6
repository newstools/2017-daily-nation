Civil servants have been awarded a pay increase of up to a third of their salary, which will be spread over four years from Saturday. State employees in Job Groups A to D, who have been earning between Sh8,910 and Sh11,370 as basic salary, will take home Sh12,192 to Sh14,442 in an agreement signed on Tuesday. The deal, which will cost taxpayers Sh20 billion, will benefit 130,000 government workers. The highest beneficiary of the deal, at Job Group N – who were earning Sh48,190 to Sh65,290 – will be paid Sh51,486 to Sh81,184 per month from July 1. UNCHANGED HOUSE ALLOWANCE However, the civil servants will have to contend with an unchanged house allowance, whose increase will be implemented next year and harmonised by grade. It is expected to be between Sh7,500 and Sh100,000. The basic salary increase is between 16 per cent and 30 per cent with a health service allowance, nursing service allowance and risk allowance for veterinary personnel as part of the new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). However, civil servants in Job Groups P to U were left out of the deal as they are considered to be at management level. COMMUTER ALLOWANCE All the employees will also receive a monthly commuter allowance of Sh3,000 for those in Job Groups A-F while those in Group G will get Sh4,000 and Group N Sh6,000. Leave allowance will be paid once in a financial year to all employees at between Sh4,000 and Sh6,000.  “An employee stationed in any designated hardship area may proceed on leave twice a year (from January 1 to June 30 and from July 1 to December 31) provided that the employee takes not less than half of his/her leave entitlement,” states the CBA. “The employee will be eligible for payment of leave allowance twice per year.” TRANSFER ALLOWANCE The CBA states that a transferred employee will be paid a transfer allowance equivalent to one month’s basic salary prior to their release to the new station, provided it is not less than 40 kilometres from the old one. Those travelling on duty within and outside the country will be paid a daily subsistence allowance at rates to be determined by the government.

She hoped it will lead to increased productivity and also raise staff morale and confidence.

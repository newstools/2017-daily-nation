While the elite golfers will be battling it out for points in the Limuru Open, a Kenya Amateur Golf Championship (KAGC) series event, it is action as usual elsewhere in the country.A total of 13 tournaments are scheduled for this weekend at different clubs in the country. They include the annual Polycarp Igathe Cup at the par 72 Ruiru Sports Club course which was the venue last weekend of the Accountants Golf Day. This weekend s tournament, sponsored by Polycarp Igathe, a former Vivo Energy managing director, has attracted a field of 200 golfers drawn from various clubs in Nairobi as well as Kiambu, and Thika.They will be vying for over a dozen prizes courtesy of Igathe, also a member of Ruiru, who is the running mate of Nairobi Gubernatorial candidate Mike Sonko.Hence the theme of this year s event which marks its 15th year, is Let s Fix Nairobi".

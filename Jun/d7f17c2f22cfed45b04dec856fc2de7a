PARIS Caroline Wozniacki reached the French Open quarter-finals for the first time in seven years on Sunday with a 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 win over 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. Danish 11th seed Wozniacki, who made her only other last-eight appearance in Paris in 2010, faces either Australia's Samantha Stosur or Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia for a semi-final place. "Svetlana's a great player, especially on clay so I knew it wouldn't be easy," said the 26-year-old after her eighth win in 14 meetings against the Russian. Sunday's clash was their first on clay. "I played a great first set but I still knew I had to stay cool and aggressive."

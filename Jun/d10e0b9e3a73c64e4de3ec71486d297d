A 78-year-old man from Nkabune in Meru shocked his family after he vowed to sell his property and channel the cash to President Uhuru Kenyatta s campaign.Mr Zablon Mukiira, who has voted in General Elections since 1970s, took the radical decision over what he said is a threat posed to Mr Kenyatta s re-election by the Opposition.He has told his family he intends to sell a bull and three sheep to campaign for the Jubilee Party's presidential candidate across Kenya.Mr Mukiira has also said that he would sell a prime plot in the outskirts of Meru Town if he runs out of money before accomplishing his mission.The father of six says he came up with the radical decision after he learnt that Nasa flag bearer Raila Odinga was enjoying significant support in parts of Meru and Tharaka-Nithi.When the Nation visited his home, the former Mau Mau fighter was unmoved by pleas from his sons. I will sell my only bull at Sh40,000 and three sheep at Sh25,000 to campaign for the President because I feel some people don t want to vote for him. I believe in his leadership because he has done a lot for us in the last five years. I will move from village to village to tell people what the Jubilee government has done, Mr Mukiira said.AGAINST MOVEHis wife Esther and their two sons Gregory and Dominic Mutethia are against the move and have been begging him to abandon the idea for the last two months. We are afraid that our father will make true his threat because he has been asking us to look for buyers. If he succeeds to sell the livestock, he is likely to auction the plot too. He is not ready to listen to anyone including fellow elders, said Gregory.The son noted that two prime acres sit adjacent to Nkabune Technical Training Institute and could fetch up to Sh10 million.Mr Mukiira said he would target parts of Imenti and Nyambene where Nasa was gaining ground. As a Mau Mau fighter, he said, he used to meet with President Jomo Kenyatta in Embu, something that endears him to the current President. email print email print

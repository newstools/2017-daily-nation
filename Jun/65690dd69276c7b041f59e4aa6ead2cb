It was a sad day for a Rift Valley Region athlete, Kelvin Kibiwott who collapsed with just 100 meters to the finishing line in the boys 10,000m event during the Copa Coca-Cola National Secondary Schools Term 2A Games at Mbaraki Sports Club, Mombasa on Thursday. Kibiwott was highly favoured to finish second but with only 100 meters to complete the hotly contested race, he started wobbling before collapsing on the track.

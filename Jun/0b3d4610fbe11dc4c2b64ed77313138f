Nine people have been arrested for vandalising Meru governorship candidate Kiraitu Murungi s billboards.The more than 10 billboards were vandalised on Wednesday night in Meru town a few hours after they were put up on streetlight posts along a stretch where Meru CID headquarters, county government and Meru County Commissioner offices are located.Some of the billboards were torn to deface the message while others were completely torn.Meru police commander Nelson Taliti said the suspects will be arraigned in court on Friday. The suspects must be opponents of Mr Murungi. The billboards are worth millions of shillings and were destroyed about two hours after they were erected, Mr Taliti said.This happened as Mr Murungi planned to launch his campaign on Thursday after presenting his papers to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.He will later hold day long rallies in Meru governor Peter Munya s backyard.In January this year, PNU billboards were vandalized ahead of President Uhuru Kenyatta s visit to launch the Jubilee party in Meru. email print email print

By directing school principals to keep politics out of the learning institutions during the election campaign period, the Teachers Service Commission is spot on and deserves the support of all. Because schools are spread around every corner of the country, they are invariably pushed to the centre of the electioneering during the campaigns since they often serve as venues for public rallies and voter registration centres, as polling stations and vote counting centres. Teachers also form the bulk of the staff hired by the electoral agency to serve as returning officers, presiding officers and clerks on the polling day. OPINION SHAPERS Still, because teachers are generally considered as being opinion shapers in towns and villages, political aspirants often consult them. With that kind of scenario, it is easy to see why TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia on Tuesday warned headteachers to ensure that schools remain free of the toxicity of the poll euphoria. While teachers, like any other Kenyans, have a right to exercise their democratic rights to choose whom to vote for, they should not do so at the expense of their core mandate. They should not also be allowed to poison the minds of their charges with campaign propaganda, because they are not old enough to get entangled in the muck and mire in our politics.

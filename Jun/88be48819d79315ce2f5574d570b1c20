Nasa flag bearer Raila Odinga has termed the recent compensation of Internally Displaced Persons by the Jubilee government as a bait to woo voters.Addressing supporters at Kamere grounds in Naivasha, the Opposition chief claimed there were more than 5,000 IDPs in Naivasha who were languishing in poverty and were yet to receive a penny from the government.He said the IDPs were victims of the post-election violence that rocked Naivasha, citing a Mr Bernard Orinda Ndege, who lost his entire family, but was yet to receive any compensation. The government had claimed months earlier that it had closed the chapter of IDP compensation only for them to resurface in Kisii with IDP kitty. It s suspicious, said Mr Odinga.SKEWED DISTRIBUTIONHe tore into the Jubilee administration for what he termed as skewed distribution of the IDP cash, with some communities receiving more money than others. The IDPs received a paltry Sh50,000 compared to their counterparts in other areas who got more than 400,000, claimed the Nasa presidential torchbearerHe wondered why the government continued to ignore the plight of IDPs residing in Naivasha, yet it had been compensating other victims across the country and making pledges.The crowd cheered when Mr Odinga assured the Naivasha PEV victims that they will be among the first to be compensated if they ascend to power.RETALIATORY ATTACKSDuring the violence, retaliatory attacks on perceived ODM supporters took an ethnic dimension after members of the Kikuyu community who were fleeing hostile regions in the country arrived with harrowing tales of their ordeals.The arrival of the IDPs combined with the accumulation of minor incidents throughout December 2007 and the first half of January 2008, led to an extremely volatile situation and laid the ground for the revenge attacks on non-Kikuyus in Naivasha between January 27 and 30, 2008.READ: IDPs in Kisii get Sh358m compensation - VIDEOMr Odinga at the same time, faulted some of the flower farm owners whom he accused of mistreating their workers by paying low wages among other malpractices.INDUSTRIAL PEACEHe told the crowd that under Nasa the region would experience industrial peace and job security, saying the Jubilee government had done little to address the plight of the workers.The politician claimed that the idea of extending the Standard Gauge Railway line to Naivasha was meant to benefit few influential individuals. We are aware that the project is designed to pass at private farms which will in turn benefit the group that is close to power, he said.READ: Before you vote: The truth about integrated IDPsThe alliance s co-principal, Mr Musalia Mudavadi, accused President Kenyatta and his deputy of taking credit for projects initiated by the coalition government.SAME REGIMEMr Mudavadi said the two have persistently accused Nasa leaders of not having done much during their tenure in government, yet the duo was also serving in the same regime. If the retired President Mwai Kibaki failed in developing the country as they are alleging, then they are products of the failed government, he said.A heavy downpour curtailed speeches by other speakers who included Nasa co-principal Moses Wetang ula and Senator James Orengo.Chama Cha Mashinani gubernatorial candidate in Nakuru Peter Koros and Woman Rep contender Gladys Kamuren were in the entourage. email print email print

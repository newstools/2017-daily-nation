Ugandan musician Jose Chameleone has an upcoming concert dubbed Legend: Hit after Hit, but the performance could hit a snag after one of the alleged sponsors distanced itself from it. StarTimes was advertised as one of the sponsors of the concert which they have denied.In a Facebook post, the television service provider revealed that it is not aware of such a performance. StarTimes wrote: Disclaimer. It has come to our attention that this promotional advert is running across all social media platforms. As StarTimes we are not aware of any partnership in this concert. Please ignore it. Chameleone however responded saying: The dates changed from one to another as we sought the appropriate one. Whether true or false, as claimed in the picture we are bound for the moon. The concert is slated for June 30 in Uganda. Chameleone will also hold two more performances on July 1 and 2 respectively. email print email print

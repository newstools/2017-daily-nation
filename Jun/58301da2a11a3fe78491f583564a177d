A campaign meeting by Tharaka-Nithi Governor Samuel Ragwa at Mutindwa wa Mbogori market in Maara Sub-County has been disrupted after supporters of two MCA candidates for Chogoria Ward clashed. Ms Cirindi Kithinji, who is vying on Maendeleo Chap Chap accused Mr Ragwa of side-lining her and favouring her rival, Ms Purity Wanja, the incumbent MCA who is seeking re-election on Narc Kenya. The rowdy supporters paralysed the meeting for almost one hour as they continuously shouted slogans of their favourite candidates. The governor’s security team intervened and ejected the violent supporters to avoid more clashes. After normalcy resumed, Mr Ragwa condemned the incidence and called for peaceful campaigns. "This is my meeting and no one is allowed to ferry supporters to disrupt it," said Mr Ragwa. He added that he is not interested in the MCA’s position and vowed to distance himself from ward politics.

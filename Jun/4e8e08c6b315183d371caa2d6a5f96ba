Menengai Day Mixed Secondary won the rugby sevens title after a hard-fought 7-5 win over Chavakali High in the National Secondary Schools Terms Two A Games at Shimon la Tewa, Mombasa on Saturday. It was Menengai’s first national title having finished seventh in their last appearance at this stage in 2014. “I think we wanted it more and our defence won it for us today. The missed conversion for Chavakali cost them and we were able to hold on,” said Menengai coach Evans Adenya after the match. Chavakali drew first blood, Felix Makokha sprinting half the length of pitch to cross over for a 5-0 lead. Menengai reacted superbly pinning back Chavakali before Nyaundo Ochieng scrambled home a try that Anthony Mwangi converted for a 7-5 lead at the break. CAGEY AFFAIR The second half was a cagey affair but Menengai held out for the famous win to clinch their maiden title. Muhuri Muchiri secured third place after a 21-15 win over Bungoma. They also secured the third and final slot for the East African Games set for August in Gulu, Uganda. Muchiri led 14-5 at half time thanks to tries from hooker Kelvin Ogwambo and Martin Chege with Daniel Mokua converting twice. Bungoma reduced the deficit just before the buzzer as Frank Saenyi powered through the Muchiri defence to score. The resulting conversion attempt was however unsuccessful. Bungoma improved in the second period and scored another try through Collins Wanyonyi.   Dolphine Omare from Nyanza region struck a double.

The Jubilee Party candidate for the Garissa woman rep seat has received a boost after she was endorsed by a clan to unseat the incumbent. Anab Subow who was fronted under negotiated democracy following the Tolomoge agreement between Samawathal and Abduwak clans was this week endorsed by a section of Samwathal who have two candidates in the race. Speaking at function held in a Garissa hotel, Mrs Subow vowed to prioritise improvement of education and health if elected as the next woman representative in the county. She said she will use the Affirmative Action fund to pay school fees for children from poor families, adding that the current holder of the seat has been selective in giving out the funds. SCHOOL FEES “It’s unfortunate that many children are dropping out of school due to (lack of) school fees. If elected as your women representative I will use affirmative action besides lobbying for funds for children in school,” she told the gathering. The Jubilee candidate said there has been a rise in maternal mortality in the county that needs urgent intervention, adding that if elected she will lobby to have mobile clinics in all sub-counties. BRUISING BATTLE Amina Keinan (Kanu) and Fatuma Kinsi (ODM) who are from the Samawathal clan, having rejected the Tolomoge verdict, have promised a bruising political battle in the August polls. Other in the race is the incumbent Shukran Gure (Wiper), Maryan Sheikh (Third Way Alliance) and Ebla Sahal (ANC). Mrs Subow exuded confidence that she will emerge victorious, refuting allegations that she is not up to task and is only a beneficiary of clan endorsement. “Those allegations are being peddled by my political detractors because when I was being chosen by Tolomoge alliance there were others who applied for the same position and I emerged the winner in that contest,” said Mrs Subow.

The number of  mother-to-child HIV infections dropped by 50 per cent in 2015, thanks to the Beyond Zero campaign, that has embarked on better maternal health. First Lady Margaret Kenyatta on Tuesday said out of the 79,000 HIV-positive expectant women in 2015, there were only 6,600 new infant infections — down from 12,000 in 2013. “We have averted 2,000 deaths among our mothers, dropping maternal deaths from 6,000 to 4,000 annually,” said Mrs Kenyatta.

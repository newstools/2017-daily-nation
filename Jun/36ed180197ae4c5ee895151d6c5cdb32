The government has launched a jetty in Shimoni and patrol boat at Kisite Mpunguti Marine Park, both in Kwale, aimed at boosting tourism and conservation. Mr Harun Khator, the director of administration in the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy, said the government was committed to putting in place appropriate policies that support fisheries and the maritime economy. “The Fisheries Management and Development Act 2016 provided for the establishment of institutions, like Kenya Fisheries Service, Kenya Fish Levy Trust Fund, Kenya Fisheries Advisory Council and Fisheries Marketing Authority,” Mr Khator said in a press release on Thursday.

The projects were funded by the World Bank and implemented by Kenya Coastal Development Project, which brings together seven State agencies including the KWS.

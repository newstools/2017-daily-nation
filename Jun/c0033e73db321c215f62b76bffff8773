Jubilee Party's candidate for the Nakuru senatorial position, Ms Susan Kihika, has suffered a major setback after the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal nullified her candidature. The tribunal led by Kyalo Mbobu said that Ms Kihika is ineligible because she still holds the Office of Speaker of the Nakuru County Assembly. "A declaration is hereby issued that Ms Wakarura’s candidature for the Nakuru County senatorial seat on Jubilee party ticket is unconstitutional," the Tribunal ruled. ARREST WARRANTS It also said that the Jubilee Party violated the law by presenting Ms Kihika’s name as its candidate yet she had not resigned as required by law. The petition had been filed by Ms Margaret Wanjiru Kiiru, who is eying the same position as an independent candidate. Meanwhile, Labour Court judge Monica Mbaru lifted warrants of arrest against Nakuru Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and two other county officials after they told the court that they will comply with orders to pay six former county employees their dues, as had been ordered by court. PAYMENTThe court had directed Governor Mbugua and the two staff to compute and pay the wages accrued while the employees were suspended, but the orders had not been complied with, compelling the petitioners to file contempt of court applications. Through lawyer Professor Tom Ojienda, the governor and the county secretaries today said they have already factored the wages in the county budget and the same will be paid.

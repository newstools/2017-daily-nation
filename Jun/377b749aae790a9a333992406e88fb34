Just who will fit in the big spikes left by the diminutive world 10,000 metres champion Vivian “pocket rocket” Cheruiyot? That is the question as finest long distance track and road runners face off in the women’s 10,000 final of Kenya’s World Championships trials at the Nyayo National Stadium on Friday. Arguably, there is no other Kenyan woman who has dominated the 10,000m race at the World Championships than Cheruiyot who won the title in 2011 (Daegu, South Korea) before recapturing it in 2015 in Beijing. Only other Kenyans have claimed the global title namely Sally Barsosio (at the 1997 Athens championship) and Linet Masai (2009 in Berlin). This year’s World Championships will be held in London from August 4 to 13. The focus on Friday will also be in men’s 5,000m final where the field is awash with youth and experience that include the World 5,000m silver medallist Caleb Mwangangi, who hopes to put behind nagging injuries for the ticket to London. QUIT TRACK Cheruiyot, who won silver in 10,000m before going for the 5,000m gold at Rio Olympic Games last year, has since quit track for the marathon, making her debut at last April’s London Marathon where she finished fourth in two hours, 23 minutes and 50 seconds. Perhaps multiple continental champion Alice Aprot and 2017 world cross country champion Irene Cheptai stand out in the star-dotted field that also has 2015 world cross country champion Agnes Jebet and World Half Marathon Championships record holder Joyciline Jepkosgei. Aprot, who is the African Games and Africa 10,000m gold medallist, represented Kenya last at the Rio Olympic Games where she finished fourth, is eying for her maiden appearance at the World Championships. Aprot, who has personal best 29:53.51 from the Rio Olympics, the best in the field, warmed up for the trials with victories over the same distance at Kenya Prisons and National Athletics Championships. “I have not trained well since the World Cross, having lost my father immediately after graduating from Prisons College. I know it will be tough but I will give it my best shot,” said Aprot. In the men’s 5,000 metres, world silver medallist Mwangangi finished fourth in 3,000m in Doha but had rough time in Eugene, finishing 23rd in 5,000m at the Prefontaine Classic in 13:31.45. He will be in a field that also has the 2013 World 5,000m bronze medallist Isaiah Kiplangat and Africa 5,000m champion Douglas Kipserem.   Maiyoro is among the pioneer Kenyan long distance runners.

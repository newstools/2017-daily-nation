About 10,000 youths will benefit from free training on securing freelance jobs in the quest to tackle the growing unemployment. The training, under a Sh280 million project funded by taxpayers and Rockefeller Foundation, will impart among other skills how to navigate the Internet, online pitching of jobs and how to respond to employers. The first phase of the project dubbed Ajira Digital Programme kicked off on Monday and will see about 8,100 youths in Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Meru and Kisumu undergo the training. The training is set to lay the foundation for the subsequent launch of a freelance job portal that will connect employers and the youth. “Globally people are beginning to work from home and Kenya cannot afford to be left behind. We have skilled youth that need to be molded and showed the way,” said ICT Cabinet Secretary, Joe Mucheru. “The trainings we are conducting countrywide are meant to give youths necessary skills that will enable them to navigate online to get these jobs and to seal these deals successfully.” Employers have shown interest in the plan which will also allow them to cut the cost of labour through the freelance jobs that eliminate the need for works stations and auxiliary benefits like medical and pension costs. ‘We intend to use this programme to create awareness around the changes going on in the work environment, to scale-up the number of Kenyans working online and letting the business community know they can create these opportunities for people working online,” Kepsa chief executive Carole Kariuki said Tuesday.

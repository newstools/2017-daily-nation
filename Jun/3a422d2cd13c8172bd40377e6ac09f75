A group of 462 women, who entertained guests during Madaraka Day celebrations at Kabiru-ini stadium in Nyeri County have been paid Sh3.2 million after President Uhuru Kenyatta’s intervention. Nyeri County Commissioner Ngumo Karuku said the women were paid their dues by State House following a standoff between them and the county government. “The money is for allowance fee promised for the six days they had practiced their songs prior to the celebrations,” said Mr Karuku in an official communication. The women, some carrying their children less than three years old, spent the night in the cold after the devolved government failed to pay them on time. Jane Gathinwa, from Kabaru location in Kieni constituency, said the county government hired their entertainment services and had pledged to pay each one of them Sh1,000 daily. Wearing black and white attires, the women thrilled the crowd with traditional songs and dances in the event attended by the President, his deputy William Ruto, ambassadors and other dignitaries. “We had no fare and the local government officials jumped the deal. We later camped outside the IEBC offices where we were allowed to spend the night in the corridors. Some politicians came and gave us breads and sodas for supper,” said Ms Gathinwa. She added that two elderly women collapsed during the night and were rushed at the Nyeri Level Five Hospital for treatment. “We walked from Kabiru-ini grounds after the county government neglected us. But we appreciate the President has saved us,” said Ms Leah Mumbi another traditional dancer.

Four people died on Tuesday after a Machakos county government vehicle was involved in a road accident along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway at dawn. The vehicle, which had been from escorting Governor Alfred Mutua’s wife Lilian Ng’ang’a, collided head-on with a Toyota Land Cruiser near Lukenya, leading to the deaths of two police officers and two county inspectorate officers. Athi River Officer Commanding Police Division Shama Wario said the driver of the Land Cruiser was taken to The Mater Hospital, where he was admitted, but was out of danger. The driver is said to have been overtaking when he collided with the vehicle carrying Ms Ng’ang’a’s bodyguards, who were travelling from Nairobi to Machakos. The bodies were taken to Athi River Shalom Community Hospital's mortuary. Governor Mutua sent his condolences to the families and friends of the officers. “We pray to the Almighty God to comfort the families of our departed colleagues and give us all the strength to bear the loss,” he said in a statement. The governor said: “Some of the officers had spent the day with me during my very busy trip to Yatta Sub-County on Monday”. The county vehicle was dropping the officers home when the accident occurred. It had just dropped off one of the bodyguards and was heading to take the others to their homes.

Doping is increasingly becoming a major threat to Kenyan athletics. It is recalled that Kenya almost got banned from taking part at the Rio Olympic Games due to doping. The country only escaped the wrath of the World Anti-doping Agency after Parliament moved fast to make amendments to the anti-doping Bill. Russia is currently suspended for what Wada described as systematic doping. The countryâ€™s sportsmen and women missed out on the Rio Olympics. The penalties for doping are severe. The ongoing anti-doping seminars for athletes, coaches and doctors are timely. Ignorance on doping regulations will not be an excuse again. The Anti-doping Agency of Kenya and Athletics Kenya must intensify their campaigns. At the same time, the government must bust those administering doping. The country must get rid of the doctors, managers and athletes perpetrating this vice. There is no honour in cheating. The county should not relent in the fight against doping.

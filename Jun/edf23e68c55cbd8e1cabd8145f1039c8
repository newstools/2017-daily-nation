Awe-inspiring moments beckon when favourites — Olympic 1,500m champion Faith Chepng’etich Kipyegon and Olympic 5,000 metres silver medallist Hellen Onsando Obiri — take on star-studded fields in their respective races on Saturday as the trials for the London World Championships draw to a close. The famous threesome of Olympic 10,000m silver medallist Paul Tanui, world 10,000m silver medallist Geoffrey Kamworor and World Half Marathon Championships silver medallist Bedan Karoki have scores to settle in a rich men’s 10,000m field in the afternoon programme. “I’m tired of playing second fiddle and I should do something good this time around,” said Karoki as he takes the battle to Kamworor and Tanui from 12:10pm. After a rather low key start to the season, world 1,500m champion Asbel Kiprop will be under pressure to show his mettle in men’s 1,500m race that has world silver medallist Elijah Manangoi, fast-rising Commonwealth Games 1,500m silver medallist Ronald Kwemoi and latest sensation Timothy Cheruiyot. Arguably, Olympic 800m bronze medallist Margaret Nyairera is favourite in women’s 800m field that has 2013 world and 2015 Commonwealth 800m champion Eunice Sum and Nelly Jepkosgei. World javelin champion Julius Yego, who is also the Olympic silver medallist, should once again be the crowd favourite as he also seeks to rally Africa bronze medallist Alex Kiprotich to qualifying for the global competition. The women’s 3,000m steeplechase will also be an interesting affair with world champion Hyvin Kiyeng having a battle at hand against world under-20 and under-18 champion Cellphine Chespol who is fresh from setting a national record at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, USA, and Beatrice Chepkoech. Chepng’etich, who is the national 1,500m record holder, and has had a good Diamond League season, winning in Shanghai and Eugene and says she is ready for the trials as she looks forward to a better show on her second appearances at the World Championships. “I’m always happy running in Kenya and I’m ready to give fans the best,” said Chepng’etich, the 2011 World Under-18 Championships and 2012 World Under-20 Championships 1,500m champion. “My graph is steady and I’m loving it.” Chepng’etich will take on Winny Chebet who recorded a second place finish of 3:59.16 at the Rome Diamond League meeting. Also in the race are Viola Lagat and World Cross Country Championships mixed relays gold medallist Winfred Mbithe, among others. Obiri, who boasts two world lead times of 14:18.37 (national record) from Rome and 14:22.47 in Shanghai is enjoying good form at the moment hence it will take something special to stop her. It will be the first time Obiri is racing over 5,000m at the World Championships.   Jebet cruises to victory in 31 minutes and 56.0 seconds at Nyayo Stadium.

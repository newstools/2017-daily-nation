For the third consecutive year, Shailesh Chandaria won the Total Excellium Economy Run after using just 3.4 litres of fuel to drive from Nairobi to Naivasha in his 1,800 cubic centimetre Alfa Romeo Giulietta car. Mike Anderson came second in his 2,200cc Alfa 159 sports saloon which consumed only 3.65 litres of fuel over the same distance as Mickey Bassi s Alfa 75 came in third in the day-long competition held on Sunday after consuming 3.70 litres of fuel. This is a very happy day for me as I have achieved my ambition of a hat-trick of wins with strong competition from my friendly rivals Mike Anderson and Micky Bassi. I was fortunate to have a comparatively clear road, enabling me to drive for most of the distance in fifth gear using very low engine revs, Chandaria said in his acceptance speech.In addition to taking home the Beppe Scarpellini Memory Trophy for finishing in first place, Chandaria also won in the category of carburettor engine cars with capacity of up to 1,800cc class, while Mike Anderson also came tops in the over 1,800 cc fuel Injection category. Sati Gat Aura brought his 2,000 cc Alfa GTV into fourth place, and this performance earned him the Peter Karanja Memorial trophy for most meritorious performance.

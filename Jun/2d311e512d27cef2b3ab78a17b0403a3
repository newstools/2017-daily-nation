MOSCOW Portugal left-back Raphael Guerreiro suffered a suspected broken leg in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Russia at the Confederations Cup in Moscow. The Borussia Dortmund defender had to be helped off the pitch on 65 minutes, and Portugal head coach Fernando Santos fears the worst. "He was hospitalised and we think he broke his leg," Santos said. "It's a black spot for Portugal - he had a great game. It could have an impact on the start of next season. "We are sad, we will see what the diagnosis is and we hope it will not be as serious as we fear." Cristiano Ronaldo's eighth-minute header gave the European champions their first win in the tournament, and a victory over New Zealand on Saturday would secure a semi-final spot.   Ronaldo picked up the man-of-the-match award in Portugal's opening 2-2 draw with Mexico on Sunday.

Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko Mbuvi has been discharged by a Mombasa court from being a surety for fugitive Mombasa Republican Council (MRC) leader Omar Hamisi Mwamnuadzi. Principal Magistrate Francis Kyambia, however, ordered Mr Mbuvi to deposit Sh200,000 in court for two cases in which he stood surety for Mr Mwamnuadzi. Mr Kyambia said although the Nairobi gubernatorial seat candidate would have forfeited the Sh1 million he had deposited as surety for the accused, the court was satisfied with his determination to bring the MRC leader in court. The senator had earlier told the court that he had sent people as far as Tanzania to track the missing MRC chairman without any trace.

He ordered police to track Mr Mwamnuadzi and take him to court. The court, which had also issued a warrant of arrest for Mr Mwamnuadzi, ruled that it would also hear an application by Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko to proceed with the case without the accusedâ€™s presence. The MRC leader was charged alongside Ms Maimuna Hamisi Mwavyombo with being in possession of offensive weapons. The case will be heard on July 28.

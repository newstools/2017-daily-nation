A charge of illegally erecting billboards against Vibrant Democratic Party Mombasa gubernatorial candidate Hezron Awiti has been dropped. The candidate was to face the charge of erecting billboards without approval from the county government. The ruling was made by Senior Principal Magistrate Charles Ndegwa on Friday. This is after Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko told the court that Mr Awiti and former county assembly Speaker Thadius Rajwai were charged with a criminal offence without the knowledge of his office. A letter from the DPP produced in court said there was no sufficient evidence to prove the charge. The DPP further indicated that no political candidate should be charged without his approval.

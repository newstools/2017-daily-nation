Kenya Railways has postponed the launch of Madaraka Express inter-county train services set for Saturday. In a statement Friday evening, Managing Director Atanas Maina said the plans for the launch were delayed by the late arrival of some of the operator’s key staff. “This has in turn delayed critical technical and operational processes that should have been completed by now in order to enable the service commence on July 1, 2017. “We had anticipated that critical technical and operational handover processes would have been completed by now,” he said. Mr Maina said China Road and Bridge Corporation employees, who are key to the operations, had just arrived in the country and need time to “go through the handover process.” “We expect to conclude the handover processes in the coming weeks and launch the Inter-County train service soon,” he said. He reiterated the corporation’s commitment to meet the demand for train transport since the launch of Madaraka Express. He said the Madaraka Express has transported approximately 75,000 passengers in the one month it has been operational.

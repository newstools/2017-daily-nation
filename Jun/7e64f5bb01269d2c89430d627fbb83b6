The second passenger train on the newly launched standard gauge railway left the Miritini station in Mombasa for Nairobi at 9am on Thursday. Excited passengers arrived as early as 7.30am and booked tickets for their journey. The passengers paid Sh700, passed through security checks before being ushered to a waiting bay. “We left Mombasa at 9am, we are now in Emali, the seats are comfortable with enough legroom,” said passenger Ibrahim Bocha. He added that at every station along the railway line, passengers were informed through public address systems where they were. GOOD TIDINGS On Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta joined over one thousand people, among them diplomats and senior government officials, on the inaugural ride aboard the train, christened Madaraka Express. The President said the inaugural trip signalled the start of good things to come for the transport system in the country. Mr Bocha added that when the train reached Tsavo National Park, the crew alerted passengers, who excitedly took the chance to look at wild animals, such as elephants and buffaloes along the way. He added that the crew also apologised for not providing dining services to passengers and promised they would resume the services in subsequent trips. During the inaugural trip, the over 1,200 passengers were treated to free meals. Another passenger, Mbatia John, said the train ride was exciting, comfortable and secure compared with travelling by bus. “There are no bumps or potholes, the ride is very smooth and I am not tired at all, there are also police officers on board,” he said.

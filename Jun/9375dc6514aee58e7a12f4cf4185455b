A grieving father’s desperate appeal to MPs to help him find out how his 15-year-old daughter died has evoked national sympathy and sent waves of apprehension among millions of parents of children in boarding schools. The girl’s death in January, was especially painful because too much time was wasted treating her for a disease she did not have, a bacterial infection. She would most likely be alive today had she been taken to hospital as the malaria infection could have been diagnosed and promptly treated. Sadly, this is just one of the many deaths that occur in schools as a result of poor health care, bullying, swimming pool accidents, brutal punishments by teachers, school fires, and so on. This raises the question: are our boarding schools safe for our children? Are the teachers skilled in handling emergency illnesses or accidents? Are they properly informed about how to respond to such occurrences? In this particular case the teacher on duty failed to sense the urgency to contact her parents immediately even as she went about ensuring that the child received first aid. Boarding schools must have skilled medical personnel such as nurses and clinical officers and appropriate facilities to ensure proper diagnoses. Above all, teachers must always reach out to parents in case there are emergencies in order to forestall such deaths.

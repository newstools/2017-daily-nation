Kirinyaga County Governor Joseph Ndathi was cleared Thursday by the electoral body to defend his seat as an independent candidate. He announced that he had picked county education execute Stanley Gachugo as his new running mate. Speaking to journalists at St Michael Primary School in Kerugoya town after presenting his papers to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Mr Ndathi said he chose Mr Gachugo because his former running mate had shown an interest in the gubernatorial seat on a DP ticket. "I had to drop Mr Reuben Ndegwa when I learnt that he wanted to run for the same county seat," he said. Mr Gachugo comes from Mwea constituency, the largest in the county with 120,000 registered voters. "I have chosen Mr Gachugo because I know we can work together and recapture the gubernatorial seat in the August 8 polls," said Mr Ndathi. Mr Ndathi said he had resolved to vie as an independent candidate after he lost in the Jubilee Party primaries. "I was deliberately rigged out but vowed that I will be in the gubernatorial race. I am confident that I will win," he said. He said he will campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta.

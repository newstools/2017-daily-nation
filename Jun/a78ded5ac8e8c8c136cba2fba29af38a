The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will on Wednesday grill 14 candidates who risk being barred from the race over misconduct. The IEBC has the power to bar candidates who, after being found guilty of misconduct, default in the payment of a fine imposed on them. Among those summoned are Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka (Jubilee) and his Ford Kenya opponent Wycliffe Wangamati. The IEBC did not give reasons for summoning the two candidates but their supporters engaged in throwing of stones on June 2 in Bungoma town, an incident that led to a woman’s death . Others to be grilled are Kibwezi East MP Jessica Mbalu (Wiper) and Prof Philip Kaloki (Jubilee), whose supporters are reported to have also clashed. Others are Starehe MP hopefuls Steve Mbogo (ODM) and Thomas Makori, Rarieda’s Eric Onyango and Netto Adhola, as well as Jubilee’s Langata parliamentary candidate Nixon Korir and independent candidate Kavore Kariuki. MCA candidates Benson Ong’onge and Fredrick Okeyo of Kayole South and Raphael Musyoki and Peris Ayuma of Mountain View in Westlands have also been summoned.

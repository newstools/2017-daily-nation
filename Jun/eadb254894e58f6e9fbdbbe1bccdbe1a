Just over a week after a video of Nakumatt midfielder Timonah Wanyonyi saying he regrets quitting Gor Mahia went viral, the Aspire Academy product has been released by the club. Wanyonyi is among four players that have been released by SportPesa Premier League debutants Nakumatt as the midseason transfer window nears its end. The Aspire Academy product was filmed openly admitting to regretting his decision to quit K’Ogalo for their arch-rivals AFC Leopards in June 2014. Once a bright prospect, hopping from one club to the other has not helped get his mojo back. His former teammate at Gor Eric Ochieng’ is another causality as well as former Kakamega Homeboyz, Chemelil Sugar and Leopards defender Cresten Mwanzo. Veteran striker Obadiah Ndege has not been spared either. The former Ushuru FC and Mathare United man has spent most of his time on the bench in the Anthony Mwangi-coached side. “It’s normal to release non-performers in the transfer window. We want to reinforce our squad ahead of the second leg,” club’s secretary general Albert Wesonga told Nation Sport on Wednesday. Wesonga has added that they are closing in on the signing of defender Jackson Saleh and Victor Okulu from Western Stima and FC Talanta respectively. Nakumatt, enjoying their first year in the top flight, have managed to register five wins, four draws and four losses in 14 matches. They sit 10th on the 18-team standings with 19 points from 13 rounds.

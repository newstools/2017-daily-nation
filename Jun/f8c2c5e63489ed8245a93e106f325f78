One of the unfortunate facets of the education system in Kenya is the wide disparity between the performance of top schools and those at the bottom of the scale. A new initiative by the ministry of Education in partnership with the World Bank aims to help schools that traditionally perform poorly to raise their standards. Under the programme, 4,000 schools that recorded average Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) scores below 243 marks in 2012 and 2013 will receive intensive support to raise standards. Among other things, the institutions will be provided with resources to develop a School Improvement Plan. ACCOUNTABILITY The focus is on strengthening school management and accountability for results in the delivery of primary education. This is a welcome development. It is a well-established fact that the education students receive at the foundational level has a major impact on their life chances. Too many lives have been wasted by lack of proper instruction at that level. This programme should therefore be carefully implemented with sufficient results-based audits to ensure that the resources are put to good use. Officials should also do more to ensure the graft that blighted past such initiatives at the ministry does not feature this time. Raising the standards of the worst performing schools in thousands of schools would have an immensely beneficial impact on tens of thousands of pupils. This is an initiative that deserves support.

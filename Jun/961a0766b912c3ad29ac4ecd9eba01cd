They played against an experienced side. Penalties have no specialist, he said.The home side were fast off the blocks, pegging the Leopards backline in the early exchanges though they failed to trouble Ian Otieno in the Ingwe goalpost.Leopards slowly grew into the games, with Duncan Otieno s long range free-kick failing to test Munishi after Emmanuel Martin fouled Marcus Abwao down the left flank in the 18th minute.AFC Leopards defender Marcus Abwao (right) dribbles past Yanga's Antony Mhilu during their SportPesa Super Cup semi-final match at Uhuru Stadium on June 8, 2017.

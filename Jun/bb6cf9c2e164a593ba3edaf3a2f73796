Presidential candidate Abduba Dida of the Alliance for Real Change has written to the Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery seeking to be provided with security. Mr Dida, who was cleared by the IEBC on May 28 said in his letter that since he was cleared, his security detail and that of his running mate have not been enhanced. He complained that despite several calls to police spokesperson Charles Owino, no help has been forthcoming. “I have called the police spokesperson several times after clearance and reminded him of a failed responsibility.

PROVIDING SECURITY When contacted, Mr Owino said Mr Dida has failed to provide a list of the people he wants.

We told him to provide us with his list but he has failed to do that,” said Mr Owino. “We are interested in providing security to all presidential candidates but none has come to police headquarters about the matter.” REJECTED REQUEST Early this month, Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga asked Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to increase the number of his bodyguards from the current 16 to 50, but the IG rejected the request. In the same request, Mr Odinga had also asked the government to provide him with 11 new cars.

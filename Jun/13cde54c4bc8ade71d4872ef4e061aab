Pastor Kitoto,I am 21 years old and happened to date a 26 year old man who is married. At the time, he had broken up with his wife, and I moved in with him for two weeks, after which he told me that his wife was returning, so I had to leave. Then, I was jobless, and my land lady was threatening to kick me out since I hadn t paid rent.I asked the man to lend me the money and he promised to send me, but did not fulfill his promise. I was kicked out. Later, I managed to get a job, and I am doing well. Recently, he called me to apologise for mistreating me, saying that he wants me back. I don t know what to do.Please help me. Hi there,I am surprised that you actually see this man as worth giving another chance. As much as he and his wife were separated, he was still married to her, and your being in his life was due to selfishness on his side. Now that his wife is back, I would suggest that you move on with your life. He has a wife and a life, and you have a life to live. And you are still very young.I pray that you see the selfishness behind this man s desire to get back into your life. What is he after? I also suggest that you work on your self-esteem. Your choices are key to the freedom and happiness you will enjoy. email print email print

Six suspected members of a Mombasa criminal gang have surrendered to the authorities. The six from Old Town presented themselves to the office of Deputy County Commissioner Mahmoud Salim while accompanied by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir and human rights activists. This comes a day after County Commissioner Evans Achoki gave a 10-day ultimatum for the youth to surrender. REHABILITATIONHe gave the order a few days after notorious criminal gang leader Mohamed Bobocha was killed by a mob. Speaking after receiving the six at his office at Treasury Square, Mr Salim said the youth would be taken through a process that will ensure they follow the law. “We are happy they heeded our calls to surrender. We are now going to take their fingerprints and send them to Nairobi for further analysis. "They will also be required to report to the authorities every week for a follow-up,” he said. PARENTS SHOULD HELPMr Salim urged the remaining youth who are part of the gangs to surrender to the authorities. Mr Nassir asked the authorities to follow the right procedures in helping the young people. “I want to tell parents who are still hiding their children to let them come forward so that we can help them. This is for the good of our society,” the lawmaker said. HUMAN RIGHTS Kenya National Commission on Human Rights chairperson Kagwiria Mbogori urged the security agents to deliver justice to the affected families. “We have been following this matter and we came here to see how we can help the youth and their families. "This is a problem Old Town is facing and we are doing all that is possible to help end the menace,” she said. She added that there is need for relevant authorities to ensure peace prevails as the country heads for the General Election.   They said insecurity has taken away the glory of the resort city.

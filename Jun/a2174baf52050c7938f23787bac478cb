Elders contracted by the National Youth Service to supervise cohorts in Subukia, Nakuru County are calling on the government to pay their wages dating back more than a year. The more than 50 elders claim they worked for three months from May to August 2016 but were never paid and there is no one to explain to them what transpired. According to Mr Josephat Kuria from Subukia Sub-County, they worked for two phases, each lasting three months but were only paid for the first phase. “We were supposed to be paid Sh1,000 per day in the three months but we have not received any money since then. We worked for 60 days but were later informed that we would receive Sh59,000 since one of the days was a public holiday, the amount we are yet to receive to date,” said Mr Kuria. HUGE DEBTS They now claim they are unable to move on with life since some have entered into huge debts with the hope of repaying after getting the wages from NYS. “We are unable to pay bills which include school fees for our children. The administrators further pushed us to look for halls that were used to train the youth. They have not been paid for to date and the business owners are now on our necks,” said Mrs Chelang’at Ng’eno. They claimed that one of the administrators only known to them as Mr Michuki has since gone missing. They called on the government to look in to the matter to ensure they are paid before the August elections, expressing fears that they may not be paid thereafter.

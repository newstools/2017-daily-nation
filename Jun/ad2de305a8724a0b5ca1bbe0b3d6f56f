The Taita-Taveta administration is embarking on multimillion-shilling water projects to address shortages. Governor John Mruttu said Tavevo Water and Sewerage Company has already signed a deal that would see water supplied to various parts of the county. "Once the project is complete it will enhance food production, improve farming activities and ensure that the residents have access to clean water for domestic use," Mr Mruttu said. DROUGHTSpeaking to the residents, Mr Mruttu said the Maunguâ€“Bughuta project will be carried out in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Society. It will cost Sh40 million and will benefit more than 18,000 people. The governor said the current water shortage, caused by drought that started last year, has led to low yields, which has in turn caused hunger. FOREIGN PARTNERSHIP He said that the county is also working on another water project dubbed Kisambinyi-Konenyi, which will require Sh20 million. More than 15,000 residents will gain. Other water projects include Kaloleni and Nakuruto that will cost Sh50 million, with over 20,000 poised to benefit. "Apart from these projects, the county has also engaged foreign donors who have agreed to establish Banana Processing Plant in Taveta at a cost of Sh116 million," he said. RAIN WATERHe said the processing plant would not only create job opportunities but also reduce poverty. The county boss said that once the plant is established, farmers will have a ready market for their produce. More importantly, Mr Mruttu said the projects will move locals away from over reliance on rain water. Other alternatives are the drilling of boreholes and dispatching of bowsers. During the dry season, water will be drawn from Lake Challa and Njoro kubwa canal and supplied to dry areas such as Maktau, Mwatate, Voi, Kasighau and Kishushe.

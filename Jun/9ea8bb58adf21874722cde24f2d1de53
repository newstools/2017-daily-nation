The building of a Sh274 million stadium at Kirubia in Chuka/Igambang’ombe, Tharaka Nithi County, has kicked off with President Uhuru Kenyatta expected to launch the project on Tuesday. Sitting on a five-acre piece of land, the stadium, which is run by Sports Kenya, is being built by Toddy Civil Engineering and Construction Company, will have a tartan track, swimming pool, football, rugby and volleyball pitches and a gymnasium. President Kenyatta, who started his campaign tour of the Meru region Friday, is slated to officiate the ground-breaking ceremony of the stadium project during his visit to Tharaka-Nithi County next week. On completion, the stadium is expected to encourage sporting among the county’s youth and boost the economy of the fast-growing Chuka Town, the county’s commercial hub. SPORTS KENYA Chuka/Igambang’ombe MP Muthomi Njuki said his constituency has spent Sh18 million to relocate some societies’ offices, grade and fence the stadium before it was taken over by Sports Kenya. The MP who is seeking Tharaka-Nithi governorship on a Jubilee Party ticklet lauded the government for considering to build the stadium in the county, adding that he will seek more funding for the project during the President’s visit. “This will be the only stadium built by the national government in the region to be used by the neighbouring counties and also hold national and international sports activities,” said Mr Njuki at the site. Mr Kenyatta is also expected to commission the tarmacking of Chuka Town streets, the multimillion Kibunga market stalls, Mwanjati Technical Institute, Tharaka Technical Institute and Muring’a Banana Water Irrigation Project, among others. He will also inspect the ongoing tarmacking of Gatunga-Chiakariga road and other national government projects.

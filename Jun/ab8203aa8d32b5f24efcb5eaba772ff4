Eleven people who were arrested in connection to vandalism of the multibillion-shilling Standard Gauge Railway line have been charged with sabotage, destruction of infrastructure and engaging in organised criminal activity. Among the accused, seven were charged with dealing in scrap metal without a license contrary to the Scrap Metal Act. ARREST WARRANTThe accused who appeared before Mombasa senior principal magistrate Lillian Tsuma Lewa denied the charges. They are Peterson Senteu, Theophilas Mwongela, Bernard Maina, Joseph Mbugua, James Ndichu, Wilbrod Omondi, Joel Kabiru, Mugi Nyaga, Moses Wanyama, David Musyoki and Nicholas Muthuku. The prosecution applied for a warrant of arrest against another suspect Paul Sila. LIFE SENTENCESenior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Alexander Muteti opposed the release of the accused on bond. He said the timing of the destruction manifests the intention to sabotage the launch of the railway service. Mr Muteti further argued that the offence of sabotage attracts a sentence of life imprisonment upon conviction, hence it may tempt the accused to escape should they be released on bond. The court will deliver a ruling on Monday next week whether the accused will be released on bond or not.

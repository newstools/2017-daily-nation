A group of Kiambu residents want Governor William Kabogo, his cabinet and all ward representatives to refund the monies and other benefits they were paid in form of salaries and allowances while in office on grounds that they failed to perform their mandate. This follows a ruling by Justice Isaac Lenaola in February this year, which annulled all the county legislations on grounds of their constitutionality since they were never published in the Kenya Gazette, as mandated by Article 199 (1) of the Constitution. Justice Lenaola, in his judgment delivered on his behalf by Justice Chacha Mwita, had however given the county n a 90-day window to regularise the legislations, and allow it to use the “illegal laws” to avert staling of operations. But should the county fail to do correct things within the three-month period set by the court, Justice Lenaola ruled that it would automatically lead to invalidation of the laws. PETITION On Thursday, seventy residents led by James Gacheru filed a petition at the Kiambu High Court seeking a determination as to whether members of county executive and the assembly deserved any form of payment, arguing that all their functions in the last four years were unconstitutional. “The court should determine whether persons elected, nominated or appointed state offices can neglect, ignore or refuse to discharge their statutory duties for which they mandated discharge, and at the same time draw salaries and emoluments from public coffers,” the petition read in part. The petitioners are of the view that the county executive and the MCAs have nothing to show for their work since all the legislation which they approved, were nullified, and therefore ought not to have been paid anything. Should the respondents be found not to have performed their duties, the petitioners want Justice Joel Ngugi to order the county secretary and the County Assembly to recover all the monies paid to the governor, his deputy Gerald Githinji, all county ministers, Speaker Gathii Irungu and 82 MCAs.

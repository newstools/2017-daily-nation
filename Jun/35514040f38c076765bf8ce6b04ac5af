Karan Patel has maintained steady rise in the Kenya National Rally Championship series standings with another good performance in the latest round. Patel, who spent most of last season in the European circuit as part of the Ford Fiesta Team, is adjudged to have gained considerable experience oversees to now become one of the top drivers in the local series. “It is a good feeling to have had a podium finish in the Rallye Sport Club event with a third place. It is now important to be consistent to stay at the top with the most established drivers in the competition,’’ said Patel. The 26-year-old driver, driving a Mitsubishi Evo 10 car, has now jumped to fifth place in the overall standings of the 2017 KNRC with 59 points after finishing third in Fly540 Rally. Patel added: “Punctures affected most of the drivers like (Ian) Duncan, Tapio (Laukkanen) and rest of us suffering heavy penalty. I had one but fortunately did not cost me heavily." Karan’s other achievements so far include three Class Championship titles in 2014 where he won the Division Three and Group S titles after finishing ninth overall. He also competed in five rallies in the WRC circuit last year. Duncan, the former multiple national champion, has reclaimed to the top spot with 72 points after finishing fourth in the latest event where earlier leader, Tapio Laukkanen failed to score any points. Another youngster making news is Farhaaz Khan, whose Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10 finished fifth in the latest rally. He is now placed seventh overall in the standings. The next round of the championship will be held in Nanyuki from July 21-23.   This was Laukkanen’s first retirement of the current series.

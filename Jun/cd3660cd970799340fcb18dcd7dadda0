Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero has said that despite sabotage from the national government, he has managed to deliver most of the promises he made to city residents in 2013. Addressing the media on Tuesday after meeting over 1, 000 National Super Alliance (Nasa) women leaders from Westlands constituency, Dr Kidero said that his development track record and service delivery to Nairobians was unrivalled. “Despite the national government not paying us the Sh72 billion they owe us in debts, we have made good account of the monies we have received. We have fulfilled most of the promises we made in 2013,” said Dr Kidero. He said that the debt owed to the county government, if paid, would have made the operations at the county easier as the county only collects around Sh14 billion annually and gets on average Sh13 billion from the national government yet they have a wage bill of around Sh18 billion every year. The governor said that even with the little they have, they had managed to develop the city by building roads, refurbishing and modernising hospitals, dispensaries and schools. “We have done roads, hospitals, 17 dispensaries are now 24 hours, built maternity and modern mortuary at Mbagathi, modernised City mortuary, built an inpatient hospital at Mutuini, and schools,” he said. However, he could not resist taking a swipe at his opponent, Senator Mike Sonko, chiding him for being full of theatrics exuding confidence that Nairobi voters would support his re-election. “Nairobi is not a town for playing circus. Nairobi sio jiji la sarakasi ni ya wale watu wamekomaa,” said the governor. He urged peace to prevail before, during and after the August elections saying that the unity of the county was more important than individual interests. “Nairobi has 42 tribes and people live in peace and so we will not entertain people trying to divide us along tribal, religious or racial grounds,” he said.

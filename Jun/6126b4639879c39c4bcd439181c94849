LONDONAt least 12 people perished on Wednesday after a massive inferno tore through a London apartment block, with witnesses reporting terrified residents had leapt from the tower and dropped their children in a desperate bid for survival.As smoke continued to billow from the gutted building, survivors voiced anger over longstanding safety fears at the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, which was home to between 600 and 800 people.Parents wrapped wet towels around their children as they tried to escape, while others were seen desperately waving for help from the higher floors, which firefighters could not reach at the blaze took hold.Fire engulfs Grenfell Tower, a residential tower block on June 14, 2017 in west London.

They had used drones to examine the upper floors.Blazing chunks of debris fell from the wrecked building, a 1970s local authority-built block in the working-class area of north Kensington, just streets away from the wealthy homes of Notting Hill.Residents claimed the fire spread on the exterior of the tower, which had been covered in cladding in a major refurbishment completed last year.The London Fire Brigade said the cause of the fire was under investigation, but its chief Dany Cotton said she had "never seen anything on this scale" in her 29-year career.WE SAW THEM DYINGWitnesses said they heard screaming from the upper floors as the flames raced up the tower."I saw people jumping out of their windows," Khadejah Miller, who was evacuated from her home nearby, told AFP.Two witnesses said they saw children dropped by their parents out of the building into the arms of people on the ground.Adi Estu, 32, who lives nearby and took refuge in a church with her husband and nine-month-old son, said: "I saw people flashing their lights for help, families flashing their mobile phones like a torch. But the smoke covered them.WE SAW THEM DYINGMembers of the local community delivered food, water, blankets and clothes to the local church and nearby community centre, where frantic families attempted to call their loved ones, fearing they could be stuck inside.Eddie Daffarn, a 16th-floor resident, said he struggled to find the stairs as the building filled with black smoke until a fireman grabbed his leg and directed him to safety."Loads of people haven't got out," the 55-year-old said.He said residents had complained for years about mismanagement of the block, saying he had warned that "one day there will be a catastrophic fire and that will hold these people to account".Firefighters react as a huge fire engulfs the Grenfell Tower in west London early June 14, 2017.

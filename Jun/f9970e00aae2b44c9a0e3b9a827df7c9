Saturday marks a new milestone in the Kenyan national football team’s quest for a slot in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations after six unsuccessful attempts. It has been 13 years since Kenya last qualified for the continental event and as the national team takes on Sierra Leone in Freetown this evening, it will be carrying the entire nation’s hopes. True, Harambee Stars is facing a herculean task as it has been put in the same pool as Sierra Leone, Ghana and Ethiopia. The team needs victory on Saturday to tide themselves over ahead of the tougher ties against Ghana and Ethiopia next year. A cocktail of poorly motivated players, travelling nightmares and poor team selection in previous editions has seen Kenya start the tournament on a poor footing. Thankfully, Football Kenya Federation moved to ensure that all the players received their allowances in full before travelling, and the Sh3 million winning bonus promised by team sponsors, SportPesa, should provide additional motivation to the squad. To the team’s credit, it has had a 10-match unbeaten record under coach Stanley Okumbi, and the onus is now on him and his warriors to ensure that they get a convincing victory over the West Africans. The country is rooting for Harambee Stars.

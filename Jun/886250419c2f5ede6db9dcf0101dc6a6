NEW YORKRapper turned businessman Diddy was the world's top-paid celebrity in the past year, edging out closest competitor Beyonce, Forbes said in its annual list Monday.Diddy earned Sh13 billion ($130 million) in the past 12 months, of which Sh7 billion ($70 million) came from selling a one-third stake in his Sean John clothing line.Diddy whose real name is Sean Combs and earlier in his career was known as Puff Daddy is estimated by Forbes to be worth a total of Sh82 billion ($820 million) even though he has released little music in the past decade.But he has pursued a variety of business interests and last year headlined a North American arena tour with other artists on his Bad Boy Records label.TURNED TABLESBeyonc came second at Sh11 billion ($105 million) after her lucrative "Formation" tour, an elaborately staged set of performances that followed her "Lemonade" album.Beyonc , who is expecting twins, is estimated to be worth Sh100 billion ($1 billion) with her husband, rap mogul Jay Z, who himself was number 55 on the list."Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling, who published a series of e-books last year, came in third at Sh10 billion ($95 million), making her the highest-paid celebrity outside of music.She narrowly edged out Canadian hip-hop star Drake, Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and Canadian R&amp;B sensation The Weeknd.Guns N' Roses entered the list at number 11, after the rock legends' key members Axl Rose and Slash reunited for the first time in 23 years.The list can swing rapidly from year to year. Pop star Taylor Swift, who topped the previous year's list by earning Sh17 bilion ($170 million), slipped to 49th place as she had concluded her tour.The few non-Western celebrities on the list included Hong Kong martial arts film legend Jackie Chan at number 39 and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan at 65. email print email print

It’s encouraging to note that the Kenya Bureau of Standards has come out to deny that plastic rice is being sold in the country. There has been great public apprehension following claims that such rice was on sale, and which appeared to have been lent credence by a video that has been circulating on social media. Where queries on health and safety are raised, even as a result of rumours, the authorities must act quickly. VISITED SHOPS We have it on the authority of none other than Kebs managing director Charles Ongwae that the agency’s market surveillance team visited several shops, collected samples and subjected them to the East African and Kenyan standards on rice. All the tests have confirmed that the rice in the market is fit for human consumption. We laud Kebs for acting swiftly so that the people can continue enjoying their rice. DOUBST LINGER However, doubts might still linger in some, knowing only too well that unscrupulous people will go to great lengths to earn a quick shilling. Whereas the scientific sampling method is effective, one cannot rule out the possibility of crooked people in areas that might not have been covered indulging in such deadly business. We urge the authorities to carry out thorough investigations and seal any loopholes that might be exploited by shady traders. Everything possible must be done to extend surveillance to monitor and enhance consumer safety.

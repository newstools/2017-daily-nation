Hi Brenda,I have been dating my girlfriend for three years now. I was jobless when we met and she stuck with me all through. Now that I have a job, should I tell her how much I am earning because I want to make her my wife or will she disturb me if she knows how much I am earning? First of all, it's 2017, you should ditch that mentality that if a woman knows the details on your pay slip, it means you are henpecked.Two, you have no business disclosing your finances to a woman you have not made a commitment to. If you get to the point where you want to make her your wife, then it is prudent that you both share your financial status. Not necessarily marry your finances, but I would want to know just how much debt, if any, I am marrying into.I wonder why you are worrying about money yet this woman was there when you had none. If you have been listening to those people who say that women are only after money, stop. The bigger chunk of women is working for their money.Got an issue you would like Brenda to help solve? Write to her at [email&#160;protected] email print email print I know people say you should never date a colleague but I had been on a dry spell and I thought why not?

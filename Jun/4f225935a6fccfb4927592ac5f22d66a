The recruitment of some 5,000 new teachers across the country will hardly make a noticeable impact on the acute shortage that has been a bone of contention between the Teachers Service Commission and the Kenya National Union of Teachers. It is, indeed, a drop in the ocean, considering that the shortfall is a whopping 87,000 teachers. Though a welcome gesture, it’s unlikely to assuage the demands of Knut boss Wilson Sossion, and his colleagues, who have been quite vocal about the burden their members have to shoulder. It’s also obvious that with such a huge deficit, the quality of education is bound to suffer, as the learners will not get the required attention. DONE BETTER With an allocation of only Sh1 billion for the recruitment of teachers this financial year, the TSC could not have done any better. However, quite welcome is an assurance by chief executive officer Nancy Macharia that the successful candidates will be deployed to any part of the country. The TSC is, no doubt, alive to the need to increase staffing to a level that makes learning more beneficial in primary and secondary schools and tertiary institutions. Financial constraints notwithstanding, we hope the TSC will seek higher allocations and that Knut will continue to push for more teachers. After all, both should be motivated by nothing but the best interests of the learners.

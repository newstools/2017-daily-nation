Most of the women senators, who were picked by political parties to the Senate in 2013, have used their nomination as a stepping stone to elective politics in this year s General Election.Almost all the 18 senators fought off competition during the primaries, to clinch their parties tickets to run for seats in the National Assembly as either MPs or County Woman Reps and at the Senate, where they have served for one term, with one running for a Member of County Assembly. Seven of the women senators are in the race for MPs seats, while two are aspiring to be their County s Women Reps, with a similar number opting to compete for senatorial seats. Senator Godliver Omondi of ODM, a representative of those with disabilities, is seeking to be MCA for Kholera Ward in Kakamega County on an Amani National Congress ticket. Those gunning for MPs seats include Majority whip Beatrice Elachi, Ms Martha Wangari, Ms Joy Gwendo, Ms Naisula Lesuuda, Ms Judy Sijeny, Ms Emma Mbura and Ms Elizabeth Ongoro.

The law will ensure that both elected and nominated MCAs are sworn in together after the General Election. An alumni and former student leader of the University of Nairobi, Ms Wangari has also sponsored other Bills, like the amendment to the Employment Act and amendments to the Societies Act to regularise registration of self-help groups.

The Bill does not in any way provide for contraceptives in schools, she protested, saying it was to ensure adolescents are given moral and spiritual guidance. School going child shall access age-appropriate information, she argued.

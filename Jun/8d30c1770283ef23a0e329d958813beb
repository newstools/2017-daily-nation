Hi,My husband is too dramatic! He has cheated on me with about 45 women since we got married. I treat infections every month. I am tired but when I pack my bags to leave, he begs and cries like a baby. He has even cried in front of the whole church when I caught him cheating. What can I do to get out of this situation? It is all very draining. Why are you with a man that has cheated on you with 45 women? Have you that little respect for yourself?Anyway, there are two things I can tell you about this man you call your husband. First, he is not going to stop cheating. Second, do not let his remorse confuse you or soften your resolve. He is sorry you caught him not that he cheated.If for some reason you decide to stay, stop complaining about it. It s not going to change unless you do something about it. With all these sexually transmitted illnesses going around, if you are going to have sex with him, make sure it s safe sex. email print email print My husband of three years wants to marry his side-chick as his second wife.

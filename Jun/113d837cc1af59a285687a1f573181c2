The current Bandari coach Paul Nkata led the brewers to a double last season.In Kisumu, second-placed Gor Mahia will be hoping to pile pressure on Tusker when they battle the third-placed soldiers in what is expected to be a closely contested match.Gor lost the top spot to Tusker a fortnight ago after their 2-0 loss to Sofapaka, while Ulinzi Stars failed to capitalise on the result after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Sony Sugar at Afraha Stadium.Gor, under the guidance of caretaker coach Zedekiah Zico Otieno, will miss the services of skipper Musa Mohammed who is suspended, meaning Joash Onyango, Harun Shakava and Wellington Ochieng will start at the back.In Ulinzi, Gor face the team with the most lethal attacker in the league in Stephen Waruru."Our aim this season is to win the league and if my goals help along the way, the better. Gor Mahia are the toughest team to play against in the league but you have to beat such teams to win the competition. We are ready," said Waruru, who is the league's current top scorer with eight goals.

With only two wins in 14 matches and the worst defensive record in the league so far, Mathare will be seeking to floor the hosts who will be without suspended striker and club top scorer Bernard Odhiambo."We urgently need stability at the back and I am encouraged we didn't concede today," Kimanzi said after watching his side's barren draw in their last league assignment against AFC Leopards.Zoo coach Sammy Okoth could hand debuts to new signings Demonde Selenga and Hamidu Kwizera.FIXTURES (All games start at 3pm)SaturdayAFC Leopards v Kariobangi Sharks (Afraha Stadium, Nakuru)Nakumatt v Sofapaka (Ruaraka grounds, Nairobi)Nzoia Sugar v Thika United (Sudi Stadium, Bungoma)Western Stima v Muhoroni Youth (Moi Stadium, Kisumu)SundayGor Mahia v Ulinzi Stars (Moi Stadium, Kisumu)Posta Rangers v Chemelil Sugar (Afraha Stadium, Nakuru)Posta Rangers v Chemelil Sugar (Afraha Stadium, Nakuru)Sony Sugar v Kakamega Homeboyz (Awendo Green Stadium, Awendo)Tusker v Bandari (Kinoru Stadium, Meru)Zoo Kericho v Mathare United (Kericho Green Stadium) email print email print He beat Posta Rangers keeper Patrick Matasi to the award

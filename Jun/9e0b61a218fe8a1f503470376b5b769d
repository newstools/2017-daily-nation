Kenya Seed Company (KSC) has brought the armyworm attack on its farms, which threatened supply of maize seedlings to farmers and ultimately food security, under control. KSC managing director Azariah Soi said the firm responded quickly after spotting an attack on one of its farms. “We were the first ones to notice that armyworms had started attacking food crops and we moved fast to spray the affected farms, a move that has so far seen an end to invasion of these insects, there is no cause for alarm now as everything is under control,” said Mr Soi. The State agency contracts people to grow seeds which are later sold to farmers for commercial maize production. KSC’s farms are in the North Rift. More than 15 counties including Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Nakuru, Busia and Bungoma have reported an invasion by the pests. These are agriculture rich counties and widespread attacks could aggravate the ongoing food crisis which has seen prices skyrocket.

Popular boy band Sauti Sol is set to hold their first ever concert in Eastlands on Sunday. The band will perform at The Point Mall in Buru Buru at the SaWA Concert. The concert will coincide with member Delvin Mudigi Savara s initiative dubbed SaWA Football Tournament. The tournament is a two-day event and the first competition was scheduled for yesterday at Camp Toyoyo in Jericho. The second one is slated for today at the same venue from 9 am to 2 pm.Savara Women Advancement Program (SaWA) is Savara s community initiative in which he seeks to engage and empower the Eastlands community where he was born and raised. When I was younger, I used to play football as a hobby and it is one of the things that enabled me to form close relationships in the hood, be healthy and fit and also avoid destructive behaviour. Football brings people from all walks of life together and #SaWA wants to bring the community together to celebrate and empower women. What better way than through engaging a football tournament. And I want the women players at home to come watch and play as well, said Savara in a press statement.The event will also include the official celebration of Savara s birthday. email print email print

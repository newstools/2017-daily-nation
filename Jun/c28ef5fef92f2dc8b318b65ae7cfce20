Now I know that we have an altogether different game coming up agaisnt Sweden."On Giroud's bold display Deschamps said: "He's our best scorer, he continues to get goals and when he's not scoring himself he helps others around him score."And he produces this sort of display even when he's had a difficult season with his club."Assessing the challenge lying ahead next week in Stockholm Deschamps added: "As we are facing a team just behind us in the table a good or very good result over there will place us in an even better situation to qualify for the World Cup."After five qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, France top Group A on 13 points, three ahead of Sweden in second with Bulgaria on nine in third and the Netherlands on seven in fourth.After Sweden, France are scheduled to face England in a friendly in Paris on June 13. email print email print

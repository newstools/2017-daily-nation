Former Foreign Affairs permanent secretary Thuita Mwangi has pulled out of the Laikipia governorship race even after getting clearance from the IEBC. Last week, Mr Mwangi obtained a clearance certificate from Laikipia IEBC County Returning Officer Agnes Mutisya to run as an independent candidate. He had named 29-year-old Silvia Museiya as his running mate. But County Deputy Returning Officer George Odhiambo confirmed that the former PS had formally withdrawn from the race. “Last week we cleared three candidates to contest the gubernatorial race. But one of them, Mr Thuita, has written to us to say he will not be a candidate,” said Mr Odhiambo. With Mr Mwangi out of the race, incumbent Joshua Irungu, who is defending his seat on a Jubilee ticket, will now face former Laikipia West MP Ndiritu Muriithi, who is vying as an independent. The IEBC official said two candidates had been cleared to vie for the senatorial seat but three unsuccessful ones had appealed to the IEBC Disputes Resolution Committee. Those cleared include former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga (Kanu) and John Kinyua (Jubilee). The outcome of the appeals will be known on Friday.

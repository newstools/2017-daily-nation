Two-time Kenya Cup winners Top Fry Nakuru RFC have officially appointed former Kenya Sevens tactician Mitch Ocholla as their new coach. Nakuru chairman Giles Littlewood confirmed Ocholla s appointment at the club s end of season dinner on Thursday night in Nakuru.Ocholla, who has since resigned from his post at Strathmore Leos, will take charge on a three-year deal at the Great Rift side fondly referred to as Wanyore . We are delighted to have Mitch at our club. In my opinion, he is probably the best coach to help us to get back to where we were. We are happy to have him here, said Littlewood.Ocholla will officially be unveiled when the club unveils kits for the next season at a date to be communicated. Littlewood is confident Ocholla will enjoy success in Nakuru. He has a proven record. Just look at what he did at Strathmore and also with the national sevens team. I am sure we are in for some exciting times at the club and he will also improve our youth structures, Littlewood added.Ocholla will take over from Enos Otieno, who took charge of the team during the 2016/17 Kenya Cup season after head coach Dominque Habimana s contract ended in April 2016. Enos left us after the Enterprise Cup and it is quite unfortunate that things did not work with him but he remains a club legend and he is always welcome here. The 2013 and 2014 Kenya Cup winners finished a disappointing seventh in the just concluded season, missing out on the play-offs.Ocholla started his rugby career at Lenana School between 1993 and 1996 before he was appointed the school s coach in 1997. He then joined the Impala Under-19 side where he won his first title. His impressive CV saw Leos lure him in 2005.He led the team to the Mwamba Cup and Eric Shirley Shield in 2007 and in the same year, Leos were promoted to the Kenya Cup. email print email print Ambaka has completed his move New Zealand's Manawatu Turbos.

Infrastructure Principal Secretary John Mosonik has expressed his pleasure with the renovation works at the Moi International Sports centre, venue of next month’s IAAF World Under-18 Championships. The competition will run from July 12 to 16, attracting around 2,000 athletes from 130 nations. Mosonik’s tour started at Kasarani on Wednesday where the roads around the stadium and parking bays are being re-carpeted before heading to the Kenyatta University where the athletes’ village is situated. Mosonik, who was accompanied by the IAAF World Under-18 Championships’ chief executive officer Mwangi Muthee and Kenyatta University acting Vice Chancellor Paul Wainaina, was particular impressed by the new security lighting systems at Kasarani and the university. “The transformation that is going on is great and I’m certain that we shall give the world the best event ever,” said Mosonik. Meanwhile, the Chinese Athletics Association has selected 51 athletes to compete at the championships. China will be aiming to add to their strong tradition at this competition. Of the countries that will be represented in Nairobi later this year, only hosts Kenya has earned more medals than China in the history of the championships that will be celebrating their 10th and final edition. Some of China’s best hopes for medals include long jumper Gong Luying, javelin thrower Liu Zhekai and race walkers Zhang Yao and Zhang Xiaole.

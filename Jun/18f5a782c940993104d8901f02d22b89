Jubilee Party nominees and independent candidates have clashed over who is fit to accompany President Kenyatta on his tour of Murang'a County. Jubilee nominees on Wednesday opposed independent candidates’ attendance at Mr Kenyatta’s events, saying they lost in the primaries and had no business following the party’s affairs. LEAVE “You lost in the nominations and left the party,” Gitugi Ward MCA nominee Jackson Mutungi shouted at the independents, including Senator Kembi Gitura, at Blue Post Hotel. “This is a Jubilee party affair and you are not needed.”   The party’s nominees led by Kiharu MP Irungu Kang'ata demanded that Mr Gitura leave the hotel where the candidates were waiting for the President. “We demand that Kembi leave the hotel because he is not the party's candidate. I won the primaries,” he said.   Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia was forced to leave after the nominees accused him of supporting some independents. They also demanded that Equity Bank Chairman Peter Munga, who attended a recent fundraiser in support of Mr Kenyatta’s re-election bid, leave.   Mr Munga and Governor Mwangi Wa Iria do not see eye to eye. Other independent candidates present were woman rep aspirant Waithera Muitherania, gubernatorial hopeful Moses Mwangi and Kiharu parliamentary aspirant Karanja Mburu.  More to follow

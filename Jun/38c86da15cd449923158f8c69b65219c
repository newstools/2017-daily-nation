Three students died Friday morning in Kaptimbor, on the outskirts of Kabarnet town, when a driver lost control of their bus before it crashed. The group was returning to Turkana after school games held in Baringo County. The crash happened around 7am when the bus hit a guard rail and rolled several times before landing in a ditch. The bus belongs to AGC Lokichar Secondary School and was ferrying students from several schools in Turkana County who had participated in the ongoing regional games at Kabarnet High School. Baringo County Police Commander Peter Ndung'u said three students died on the spot while several others were seriously injured.   "The injured students have been rushed to Baringo County Referral Hospital but we are yet to ascertain the number of passengers who were in the 66-seater bus," said Mr Ndung'u. The roof of the bus was ripped off on impact and students’ personal effects were strewn all over the scene. Mr Ndung’u expressed concern about the upsurge of road accidents in the area and called on motorists to exercise caution as they drive along the winding route in order to avert more disasters. The police boss warned school bus drivers in the area to stop carrying excess, citing rising cases of accidents involving school buses. The bodies were taken to the Baringo County Referral Hospital mortuary. The crash happened barely months after four General Service Unit officers died at the same spot.

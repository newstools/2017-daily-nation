The IAAF World Under-18 Championships scheduled for July 12 to 16 in Nairobi and the African Nations Championship planned for January have exposed the Kenya's poor sports infrastructure. We acutely need proper and modern stadiums if we want to be taken seriously in sports. Indeed, when the Jubilee administration pledged in 2013 to put up five stadiums across the country, it sounded like a timely intervention. But it has come to naught. Now, Kenya is racing against time to have Safaricom Stadium Kasarani ready for the world youth event, with just 11 days to it. Thus far, some Sh1 billion has been spent to renovate the facility, but in total, Sh2.5 billion is required to enhance that facility together Kenyatta University’s sporting facilities. Yet Kenya won the bid to stage the world youth event in 2014, so it is puzzling why the government had to wait until the last minute to release funds. Similarly, the country’s chances of hosting the African Nations Championship hangs in the balance given the poor preparation of the facilities, which may compel Confederation of Africa Football to shift the event elsewhere.

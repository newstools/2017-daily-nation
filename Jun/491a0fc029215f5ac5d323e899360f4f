The collapse of a bridge under construction has been the subject of intense public debate in the past few days. It has also, however, been the subject of jokes that could have been in bad taste had anyone been killed when the now infamous Sigiri Bridge in Budalang'i, Busia, came tumbling down. Fortunately, only about 30 people were injured. Itâ€™s noteworthy that the Ministry of Infrastructure has moved with speed to establish the cause. DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE A team of investigators is sifting through debris for clues on the setback in a project that only two weeks ago was inspected by President Uhuru Kenyatta. His involvement shows the kind of premium he has placed on the development of infrastructure. This bridge is very important to the local people. Budalang'i is literally split into two by River Nzoia, and the crossing point where the bridge is has always been a deadly spot. POLITICAL MILEAGE We hope this incident is another wake-up call on the need to ensure high standards in construction and supervision. It is a pity, though, that the matter is being politicised. Indeed, the apparent haste in the construction appears to lend some weight to claims that it was meant to score some political mileage. But, for now, what is important is for the Infrastructure ministry to intensify the supervision of all public projects to ensure they comply with the set standards.

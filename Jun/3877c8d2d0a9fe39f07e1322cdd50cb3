Florentine hotelier Stefano Giannetti has for nearly two decades maintained his position as a heavy hitter in Nairobi s foodscape.A few years ago, he extended his footprint when he opened an enchanting boutique hotel in Kampala s Kololo suburb. Villa Kololo is home to one of Kampala s most reputable eateries; Mediterraneo, which just like her Kenyan predecessors promises an authentic Tuscan and Florentine Italian dining experience to a diverse clientele.On a recent work trip to the Pearl of Africa, I decided to take a break from professional drudgery and called up a few old mates who live in the city, and it was unanimously decided that dinner at Mediterraneo was going to be that evening s plan.There is little parking space in the compound, so we had to leave our car out in the street, where there seemed to be sufficient lighting and patrolling sentries. The front of the property is nothing to write home about but I was impressed by the verdant shrubbery that covered the entryway which led us to the belly of the restaurant.MINOR MIRACLEThe space is spread across different levels with hidden groves and canopies interrupted by gargantuan trees. Tastefully decorated with rustic pieces and giant flowerpots, the dining area sits up to 160 people and the warm amber lighting makes for great ambience for couples and intimate gatherings alike.Our reserved table on the smoking terrace was set with gleaming glassware and cutlery and no sooner were we sat by the friendly maitre than a basket of delicious herb topped focaccia was presented.Noting this consistency across the Mediterraneo Group s branches with delight, I ordered my usual ricotta and spinach ravioli in a white cheese sauce rather than the tomato sauce indicated on the menu. Two of my friends and I can t for the life of me imagine why we selected gnocchi and another more contemptible one; a serving of lamb chops Why anyone chooses to eat at an Italian restaurant and does not have pasta is beyond me.We did not have to wait long which is a minor miracle considering the place was packed to the rafters and before long, we were wolfing down our meals which everybody agreed exceeded our expectations. If there is one thing Mediterraneo does to excellence is churn out the creamiest, most delectable sauces and cream. My only disappointment was the red wine sangria which did not seem to have been let to stand for long enough as the flavours weren t as strong as I d have liked, and the curacao was incredibly sweet.All in all, a wonderful dining experience enhanced by homely d cor and incredibly friendly staffers! email print email print

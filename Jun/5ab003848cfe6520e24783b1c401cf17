Female rapper Nicki Minaj simply won t let go on her beef with Remy Ma despite the latter doing the same.Minaj and Remy Ma s beef started in December 2016 when the "Anaconda" hit-maker dissed Remy on stage while performing when she screamed Free Remy .On seeing that, Remy who was released from jail in August 2014 after serving six years for violence, got into studio and recorded a dis track "Shether" that turned out to be a major hit worldwide, trending for weeks.The seven-minute dis track that traded heavy jabs line after the other, was a rendition famous diss track "Ether" by Nas released nine years ago to long-time nemesis Jay Z.Minaj later responded with two diss tracks: "No Frauds" and "Swalla" that didn t do as well nor cause as much damage as "Shether".In March 2017, in an interview with Another Round show, Remy declared she was done beefing with Minaj. But if the latest turn of events is anything to go by, it s clear that Minaj isn t done yet.In a snippet preview of rapper 2 Chainz new jam "Realize" that he has collaborated with Minaj, the generous multiple best female award winning rappers is heard firing shots again at her nemesis. I ve been winning eight years consistently, at least respect it, Minaj raps. Papoose (Remys husband) wrote that Ether record, but I broke Aretha record. See this is chess, not checkers, you cannot check the checkers. Did Nas clear that Ether record? Nah, but I will complete the record. This isn t the first time that Minaj has accused Remy of using Papoose as a ghost-writer for her dis track Shether . She did the same on No Frauds singing You exposed your ghost-writer, now you wish it was scrapped / Heard your pu*** on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap. The full version of "Realize" is one of the songs contained in the 2 Chainz album "Pretty Girls like Trap Music" that is set for release this Friday. email print email print

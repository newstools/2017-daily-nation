City politicians on Tuesday used the disaster that affected 128 people at Kware following the collapse of a building to advance their political agenda. The seven-storey building came down at Embakasi, in Nairobi’s Eastlands on Monday night. Nairobi Woman Representative Rachael Shebesh, wearing a red dress, which is Jubilee Party’s main colour, was the first politician at the scene. Ms Shebesh hit out at the county government over poor planning. But she did not spare the tenants either, saying they ignored safety warnings and continued to live in an unsafe building. LIVING IN CAMPS She pledged to give the affected families camping at Jophena Primary School a month’s rent. “We cannot afford to have people living in camps,” said Ms Shebesh. Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and his deputy Jonathan Mueke later arrived in a convoy of ODM-branded vehicles. Dr Kidero wore an ODM cap while Mr Mueke donned a Wiper one. PROMISED SH2MILLION The governor promised Sh2 million for tents and food as the county government finds an alternative place to resettle the affected. He said the county had so far demolished 34 unsafe buildings. ODM Woman Rep candidate Esther Passaris said people should give priority to their lives over property, while independent governor candidate Peter Kenneth blamed the county government for poor planning.

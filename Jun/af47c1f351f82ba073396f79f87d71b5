The change is in line with an agreement made when private equity firm Helios bought a majority stake in the company last year. Telkom chief executive Aldo Mareuse said the company is now ready to become a player to be reckoned with in the sector. "It's fair to say Telkom Kenya has not received its full potential," he said.

It has also shed the old Orange corporate colour in favour of blue and yellow colours.

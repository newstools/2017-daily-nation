Three suspected criminals were on Wednesday night killed in Kisauni, Mombasa County. Two of them were killed in Mishomoroni by a mob and the third one was shot dead by police officers at Hongera. The two had attacked area residents before they were lynched by the angry mob while the third suspect, identified by police as Mohammed Omar, was killed while he was allegedly terrorising residents in Kisauni. Kisauni deputy OCPD Walter Abondo said Omar, who hails from Lamu County, has been on the police radar. “Police got Omar in his mission of terrorising residents and when they approached him he wanted to attack one of the officers, who were forced to shoot him dead,” said Mr Abondo.

We cautioned the gangs that we are going to deal with them,” said Mr Abondo. “We gave an assurance that we will not allow our Muslim brothers and sisters to be subjected to hard times during this prayerful season. We have to maintain order,” he said. In the last 10 days of Ramadhan, Muslims attend late-night prayers called Tahajjud, which take place from 2.30am in several mosques.

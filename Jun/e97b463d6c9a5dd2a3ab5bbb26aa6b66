Police have arrested two people for stealing three crocodiles at a Malindi farm in Kilifi County. Malindi police boss Matawa Muchangi said the suspects were trying to sneak the reptiles, aged three years, from Mark Stephen’s farm at around 5pm on Tuesday. SHIP STALLS “The suspects had concealed three crocodiles in sacks but the third crocodile had died due to suffocation,” he added. Mr Muchangi told the Nation in his office that the farm owner alerted police after hearing movements in his backyard. “Police arrived at the scene and found the suspects, who are employees at the farm, with the crocodiles,” he said. He said the two will be charged with the offence of stealing by servant. Meanwhile, nine sailors were rescued in the Indian Ocean after their ship stalled at sea after developing mechanical problems. “The ship was carrying scrap metal weighing about 300 tonnes before the steering developed a mechanical hitch,” he said. Kenya Navy officers used a tugboat to pull the ship to shore. The ship was sailing from Comoros to Tanzania.

Former Kenyan champions Sofapaka have closed their midseason transfer activity with the signing of AFC Leopards midfielder Bernard Mang oli.Mang oli penned a two-year contract with the Batoto ba Mungu on Wednesday morning, few hours after the expiry of his one year deal with Leopards. He returns to the club team he served for six months in the second half of 2013 as they finished third in the GOtv Shield. Bernard Mang oli is a disciplined and experienced player.

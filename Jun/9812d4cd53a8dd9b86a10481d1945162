Kakamega Governor Wickliffe Oparanya on Thursday survived a bid to have him arrested and charged for failing to appear before a senate committee to answer to questions on alleged misappropriation of money. High Court Judge George Odunga nullified a directive by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), after finding that there was no basis for the senate to summon the governor over the allegations. Justice Odunga argued that Mr Oparanya had already been cleared by the Kakamega County Assembly. The ruling emanates from an urgent application the governor filed in court seeking to stop his imminent arrest and prosecution, as had been ordered by the DPP. The governor had told the court that it is the County Assembly and not the Senate which is mandated in law, to put his County Government to task over questions raised in the Auditor General’s report. The Senate Public Accounts Committee chaired by Kakamega senator Bonny Khalwale, had sought the services of the DPP after the governor failed to honour several summons, to appear and answer to audit queries. Governor Oparanya had earlier accused Mr Khalwale, of using his position in the senate to facilitate the alleged misappropriation claims in order to get an upper hand in his bid for the governor’s seat, which they are both eyeing.

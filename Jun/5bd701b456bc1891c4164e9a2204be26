Tharaka-Nithi Senate hopeful Kiambi Matanka is undergoing treatment after suffering a knee joint fracture following a crash involving a motorbike during President Uhuru Kenyatta’s rallies in the county. The crash occurred as Mr Matanka was being rushed to Chuka Boys High School to board his private chopper after the President and his deputy concluded their meetings on Tuesday. The Maendeleo Chap Chap candidate was airlifted to Nairobi Hospital where he is currently receiving treatment. Speaking to Nation, Mr Matanka’s aide Emmanuel Mwiti said the politician is doing well but doctors are keeping an eye on him. “Doctors have advised that he gets more check-ups to ensure that he is okay,” said Mr Mwiti. TRAFFIC JAM The aide said Mr Matanka opted to use the motorbike due to a traffic jam that had built up in Chuka Town and needed to quickly catch-up with the flight. He said the motorbike rider applied emergency breaks to avoid a head-on collision with a speeding oncoming vehicle. He assured the supporters that Mr Matanka is safe. Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki wished his political opponent quick recovery through his Facebook page. “I have woken up to the unfortunate news of injury in a traffic accident of my friend and brother Francis Kiambi Matanka,” wrote Prof Kindiki. During the president’s tour of the county, politicians from Jubilee, independent candidates and those from friendly parties joined in the campaigns.

Residents in Tharaka-Nithi County have blocked the Meru-Nairobi highway demanding that speed bumps be built after a boy was knocked down by a lorry on Monday. Police have been deployed to restore calm, with the locals engaging them in running battles. The 12 year-old boy is currently at Chuka County Referral Hospital but due to the strike by nurses, Good Samaritans are collecting money from members of the public to transfer him to Chogoria Mission Hospital for treatment.

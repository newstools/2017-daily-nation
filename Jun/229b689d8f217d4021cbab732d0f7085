LONDON Petra Kvitova has pulled out of the Wimbledon warm-up at Eastbourne this week with an abdominal injury. News of the 27-year-old Czech's absence on Monday came 24 hours after the two-time Wimbledon champion made a triumphant comeback from a knife attack by lifting the Birmingham title. "Petra Kvitova has withdrawn from Eastbourne with an abdominal injury," the WTA announced on their official twitter page. Kvitova beat Australian Ashleigh Barty 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the final of the grass-court event in Birmingham. In December she suffered severe injuries to her left playing hand while fighting off a knife-wielding burglar at her home. "It's the abdominal muscle. It got tight in yesterday's final," Kvitova explained later. "I hope it's nothing serious, but I do feel one spot specifically. "I will have treatment. I will not practise for a couple of days, for sure. I hope it will be fine in a couple of days, hopefully. "I didn't know how far I will go in Birmingham. Of course I'm happy how I played there, but it's just getting tight and I can't just continue to play. "I need a bit of relax to heal all the pain in the body, especially in the abdominal muscle."

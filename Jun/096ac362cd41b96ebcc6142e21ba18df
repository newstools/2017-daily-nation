ISTANBUL Mathieu Valbuena, the France international at the centre of an interminable sex-tape scandal, on Thursday signed for Istanbul giants Fenerbahce from Lyon. "It's with great pride I come to play at Fenerbahce ... I'm going to fight for them to win titles," the 32-year-old told a press conference. Valbuena signed for two years with an option for a third. Valbuena, whose France career was ended by the sex-tape scandal in which he was the victim of an alleged blackmail attempt, enjoyed a long stint at Marseille up to 2014 before joining Dynamo Moscow and then moving on to French club Lyon a year later. He scored 10 goals for Lyon last season, and has scored eight goals in 52 France appearances from 2010 to 2015.

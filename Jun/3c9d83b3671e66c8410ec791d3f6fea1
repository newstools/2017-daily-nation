Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) lightweight boxer, Nick Okoth, who won gold medal for Kenya in the African Confederation Boxing Championships (AFBC) held in Congo Brazzaville, has set his sights on winning a medal at the World Championships. Okoth, who returned home Monday night, said he would start training next week in preparation for the International Boxing Association (AIBA) World Championships set for Hamburg, Germany, from August 25 to September 3. The African tournament was used as a qualifier for the World Championships.  Okoth booked himself a slot in the Hamburg event along with the two bronze medallists - light flyweight Shaffi Bakari and middleweight John Kyalo - both from Kenya Police Boxing team. “The work has just begun. I will now start preparations for the World Championships which will be expected to be more challenging than the AFBC,” Okoth said. “My first major gold medal was at the 2005 Africa Zone Five Boxing tournament at Nairobi’s Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. I also won a gold medal during the 2008 Beijing Olympics qualifiers in Windhoek, Namibia in 2007, but the recent victory gives me more reason to celebrate,” Okoth added. Okoth was in the first group of Kenyan boxers who returned home on Monday night from Brazzaville. He was accompanied by Bakari, Kyalo, flyweight Simon Mulinge,  light welterweight Victor Odhiambo, welterweight Black-Moses Mathenge, light heavyweight Elly Ajowi, heavyweight Tobias Okeyo, super heavyweight Fredrick Ramogi and two female boxers who won bronze medals - flyweight Christine Ongare and middleweight Elizabeth Akinyi.  Another group of boxers was expected to return Tuesday night. In Hamburg, Africa has been allocated slots for 40 boxers - four pugilists per weight. Therefore, every male boxer who reached semi-finals in Brazzaville qualified for the World Championships. The women’s biennial World Championship took place last year in a Astana, Kazakhstan.

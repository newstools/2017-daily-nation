Workers at the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company have boycotted work demanding that contracts of two top managers be renewed. The workers for the second day on Thursday, demonstrated at the water agency’s main offices in industrial area citing political interference in the firm’s management. Contracts of Steven Mbugua (commercial director) and Johnston Ngandu (financial director) expired this month but the board did not renew them leading to the standoff. The Kenya County Government Workers Union (KCGWU) branch secretary Matilda Kimetto said that the company terminated contracts maliciously. “We are disputing the board’s move to not renew the contracts of top managers who have made this company to be where it is from making Sh60 million to the current Sh800 million,” said Ms Kimetto. DISMANTLE BOARD She added that the board has rescinded a decision by human resource and committees to reinstate the two. The union is now demanding that the board be dismantled as it does not have matters the company at heart. But speaking to the Nation.co.ke, NCWS board chairman Raphael Nzomo said that they will not renew the contracts claiming that the duo had not been productive. “The allegations are false and money has changed hands,” said Mr Nzomo.

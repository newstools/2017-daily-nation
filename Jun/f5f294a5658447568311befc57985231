Though President Uhuru Kenyatta’s pledge to make secondary school education free from next year is a welcome gesture that promises to push up student enrolment and transition, it raises some pertinent questions. When the free primary school education was introduced in 2003, enrolment shot up to more than 90 per cent, giving millions of children a chance to get basic learning, which was previously out of the reach of many because of lack of tuition fees, books, uniforms and a host of other charges. Unfortunately, a good number of the children who go all the way to Standard Eight are forced to end their academic journey there to due lack of space in secondary schools and, more importantly, funds. This is why the President’s pronouncement is exciting. However, it sounds like a populist gimmick targeted at the August 8 elections. It will be recalled that before the 2013 elections, President Kenyatta promised to give 1.3 million laptops to Standard One pupils. But four years later, the project is still in its pilot phase. It would be unfair to give millions of desperate parents hope for free education when it is unrealisable. The President ought to demonstrate that his policy is well thought out and backed up by budgetary allocation. Even more significantly, he should address the teacher shortage gripping the majority of the schools.

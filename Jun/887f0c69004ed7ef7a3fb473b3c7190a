Hi Brenda, My mother-in-law passed away recently and I have spent the better part of the week playing messenger, house help, tea-girl, errands girl…you name it, all in the name of supporting my husband. I married from a different tribe so some rituals are also foreign to me and have been taking a toll on me. Mind you, I also have a 4-month-old in the house that I am still breastfeeding. The problem is that now my husband wants me to travel to the burial but I just feel like I can’t take it anymore. I am so exhausted! What do I do? Thinking about just your needs at a time when your husband has lost his mother is being selfish. Tragedy knocks at everyone’s door every so often and I imagine that you would want him to be by your side had you lost someone so close to you. Go and burry the woman that bore you a husband. If you need to, get an extra pair of hands to help with the house work or the baby. It’s not a permanent situation.  Got a relationship question? Ask Brenda.

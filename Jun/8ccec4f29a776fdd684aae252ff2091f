Former Harambee Stars and Tusker FC midfielder, Bernard Agunda, is dead. Agunda, popularly known as ‘Makambo’, was found dead on Monday in his house in Nairobi’s Umoja Estate. He was 41 at the time of his death. The cause of death of the former Kenyan international is yet to be established. Agunda, who also played for the defunct Kenya Premier League side Utalii FC, grew up in Nairobi’s Jericho Estate which is home to many of Kenya’s football players. His close friend, Athanas Obango, on Tuesday paid glowing tribute to the fallen football star. Obango, who is also the co-ordinator of Extreme Sports tournament, said Agunda, who also played professional football for St Michel in Seychelles and Tanzanian giants Simba, was a talented footballer. “I still can’t believe that he is gone. May God give his family strength during this trying moment,” Obango said of his friend who was with him in Seychelles where he was coaching a junior team. Former national team coach, Jacob ‘Ghost’ Mulee also said he was saddened by Agunda’s death. Agunda helped Utalii clinch the KPL title in 1997 before the club wound up due to lack of funding. He also helped Harambee Stars win the 2002 Castle Lager Cup after beating Uganda Cranes 3-2 on penalties in Dar es Salaam under Mulee. He also captained Tusker to victory in 2008 Cecafa Club Championships. Agunda was until his death a referee in Extreme Sports tournament held in Nairobi and served as an assistant coach of Jericho All Stars. Current Thika United coach Nicholas Muyoti, who played alongside him in the national team, said: “I pray to God to give the family strength at this trying time.” Former Tusker coach James Nandwa and ex-Harambee Stars goalkeeper Matthew Ottamax Owino also sent their condolences to the family.

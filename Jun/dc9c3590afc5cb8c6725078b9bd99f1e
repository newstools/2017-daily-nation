Magdalene Wendot has become the latest millionaire in town, winning Sh1 million in Lotto’s 166th draw. The 26-year-old Wendot from Baringo County becomes Lotto’s 171st winner since Lotto’s inception in 2015. The mother of two was named the winner of the draw conducted on Wednesday. “When I received the call from Lotto. It seemed too good to be true but thankfully I was following the programme live on television. I’m glad I won at such a time as the money will help us to comfortably bring up our two children,” Wendot said. The mother of a five-year-old son and a 9-month-old daughter said the win is welcome news to her as she plans to make the transition from being a housewife. “I have fancied rearing chicken for eggs commercially for a while and now that I have the capital for such a project, I will embark on it immediately,” she said. Wendot, who started playing Lotto mid last year, says she had previously won a mere Sh75 but she never gave up hope of winning a bigger amount.

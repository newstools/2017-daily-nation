There was joy at the Coast General Hospital after Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho waived unpaid bills of 67 patients amounting to Sh2.1 million. The patients were released from the hospital after Mr Joho gave the order on Thursday during Madaraka Day celebrations. At least 32 patients were released on Thursday and 35 others discharged Friday. “As we celebrate this day I want to tell all those who have their patients at the Coast General Hospital to pick them up for free and we are going to do this every year,” said Mr Joho at Tononoka grounds. EXPRESSED JOY When the Nation visited the facility Friday, some of the delighted patients expressed their joy. Bernard Mbithi, who was nursing a left leg fracture injury and had an outstanding debt of Sh106, 367 said he was thankful for the warm gesture. “I was admitted since March this year and my family has been going up and down looking for the required amount but in vain. Today (Friday) morning when I got the news I was more than happy. I am now leaving for home as I have been told not pay anything,” said Mr Mbithi. HUGE DEBT Another patient, Ms Vilane Lucy, who has been suffering from diabetes which led to amputation of her right leg said she could not believe that she had been allowed to go home without paying a penny. “I had a Sh44, 804 debt and I have been talking to my daughter on how to raise the amount. The good news came in today morning. I thank God for all this, and the governor for ordering for our release I am more than happy and God will reward him,” said Ms Lucy. However, some patients said the government should look for ways of settling bills for people who could not pay for their healthcare.

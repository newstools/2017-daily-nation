Thousands of families whose land was taken over by Kenya Fluorspar Company will have to wait longer before they receive Sh 1 billion compensation from the government. Mining Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu said there was no clear timeframe on when the 500 families displaced in Kerio Valley, Elgeyo Marakwet County more than 40 years ago to pave the way for the firm’s mining activities will be paid. The CS who toured the firm on Wednesday instead disclosed that a multi-agency state committee has been constituted to speed up implementation of the compensation process. “I cannot give a timeframe for now on when the payment will be made. All I can say is that a multi-agency state committee will be here on 28th of this month and I urge you to be patient as you have demonstrated for the last 40 year,” said Mr Kazungu. While President Uhuru Kenyatta had pledged that the government will release Sh 1 billion as compensation, the displaced families are demanding Sh 3 million per acre for the more than 900 acres. Hasten the process “Details on how much the government will offer for each portion of land taken over by the mining company will be determined by the National Land Commission,” explained Mr Kazungu. The Office of Attorney General, Ministries of Lands, Environment, Mining and representatives of the county government and the local community will be involved in hastening the compensation process. “We want the list presented by the Fluorspar Task Force to guide the compensation to avoid any anomalies,” said David Kiruto, Secretary, Kimwarer/Sugutek community.

Kenya has in recent years gained a reputation as the nerve centre of a suspected international network of fraudsters posing as gold traders and targeting prospective foreign buyers with heavy discounts. The template used by the sophisticated criminal enterprise, which has branches in West Africa, Congo and the Middle East, is to lure buyers into paying various “facilitation” fees – typically based on fake export, tax or security documents. Potential buyers are then asked to travel to Kenya where they are showed actual gold, sometimes in facilities purported to be “refineries”. Depending on how far the transaction goes, the buyer ends up getting nothing or having pieces of gold-coloured scrap metal exported after paying millions of shillings. What should concern everyone about the alleged criminal network is not that it exists at all. The reality is that there will always be people in society who think crime is the best way to earn a living. But in this instance, there are allegations that the suspected gold fraudsters are protected by some senior police officers and other influential individuals in government. This is given credence by victims’ claims filed over the years that despite reporting and identifying those who stole money from them, no arrests are made. These are not idle allegations, as an investigative report in this newspaper in February indicated. The top leadership of the security apparatus must move to investigate claims of protection by senior officials and dismantle the suspected criminal network once and for all.

Shock and grief gripped residents of Kikopey in Gilgil Constituency, Nakuru County, after a man said to be mentally unstable reportedly butchered his expectant wife. Witnesses said the Sunday evening incident happened hours after the man was treated at a local dispensary and discharged. The woman had gone visiting three days before and was staying at her parents-in-law’s house. Her husband had gone to his parents’ home a month earlier. VIOLENT Pastor Alex Karuri from the Trinity United Methodist Church, who followed the bizarre sequence of events, told the Nation that they had taken the man to hospital earlier. The cleric said he then escorted the man to his parents’ house, a few metres from the health facility. Upon arrival, the man fell into a deep sleep. “He woke up at noon and began exhibiting violent behaviour and his elderly mother requested me to assist the family,” Mr Karuri said. INVESTIGATE The pastor monitored the casual worker, who excused himself to go and visit a friend across the Naivasha-Nairobi highway, but his mother and the church leader followed him. “He claimed to have failed in his mission to trace his friend and hurriedly returned to his ageing mother’s house as we followed him but we could not keep up with his pace,” Mr Karuri said. Moments later, neighbours heard screams and, after rushing to the scene, found the woman in a pool of blood and the man holding a bloody kitchen knife. “He threatened a young man who attempted to disarm him before he was overpowered by rescuers who responded to the distress call.” Gilgil police boss Sarah Koki said she had just been informed about the 4pm incident and her officers would investigate.

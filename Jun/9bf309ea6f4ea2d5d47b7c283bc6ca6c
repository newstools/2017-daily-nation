A man, his wife and their four-year-old daughter were found dead in their house in Dandora, Nairobi. The bodies, with no signs of physical injuries, were found on the bed at round 2pm on Tuesday. A caretaker at the building told police that he noticed the couple and the child had not been seen since morning and the door was locked from inside. His persistent knocks on the door went unanswered. Together with other tenants, they forced the door open and discovered the bodies. They were identified as Jackson Otieno Ogutu, 33, Gorreti Otieno, and the toddler Keyla Owino. Officers who visited the scene suspected the family died of “suffocation due to a cooking charcoal jiko which was inside the room.”

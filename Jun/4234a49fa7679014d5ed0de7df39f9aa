Kenya and Uganda have restated their commitments to see the ongoing construction of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) reach Kampala. In a joint communication, Uganda’s minister for Works and Transport Monica Azuba Ntege and Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for Transport James Macharia said the commitment to build the railway is intact as earlier agreed.

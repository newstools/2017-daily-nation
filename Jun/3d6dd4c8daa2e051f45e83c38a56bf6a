An independent gubernatorial candidate in Trans Nzoia has vowed to ensure 30 per cent of jobs in the county go to women if he wins the August polls. Mr Moses Khaoya said he has started by naming a social worker, Ms Redempta Ksiro from the Sabaot community as his running mate. In a telephone interview with the Nation, Mr Khaoya exuded confidence of winning on August 8. “I will focus on empowering women and youth as they are key in development of the society. That is why I settled on a woman from minority community to be my deputy,” Mr Khaoya said.   Mr Khaoya, a farmer, said he would form an all-inclusive government for peaceful co-existence of locals in the cosmopolitan border county. His administration, he added, would further strive to ensure equity, transparency, participation and fair distribution of resources. “I will prioritise gender and economic empowerment and proper management,” he said. Mr Khaoya said he has started a door to door campaign to win locals support in the August polls.

Dear Brenda, I have been married to my wife for two years and I feel like I also married her sister and mother. Nothing goes on in our house without them knowing. I suspect she even tells them about our sex life! She is constantly talking to them and will cry to them before she comes to meâ€¦how to I tell her it is wrong? Please help?  That sounds like one crowded relationship! That said, I imagine that you came into the relationship expecting that your wife was going to be your confidante. If this is true, you are getting a raw deal. However tempting it is, resist the urge to confront your in-laws, as things can only go downhill from here. Talk to your wife instead. Instead of throwing an accusation at her, try having a heart to heart. Tell her you want the two of you to lean into your marriage.  Got a problem you want to share with Brenda?

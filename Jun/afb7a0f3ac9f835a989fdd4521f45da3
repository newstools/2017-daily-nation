Dear KitotoI am writing to you because my relationship is at risk. I have been married for four years now, yet my wife and I are yet to have a child. Last year, I found out that the problem lies with my wife. She has a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome that unbalances her sex hormones, making it difficult to conceive. As a result, my wife is deeply unhappy, making me miserable as well. Help me save my marriage or at least make my wife happy again. Hello,Childlessness is tough on many marriages, even though ideally, marriage should be more about companionship rather than getting children. I am encouraged that you have chosen to focus on your wife s feelings, rather than yours, and are seeking ways to make her happy.That said, I am sorry for what you and your wife have been going through. Since this is a medical issue, I suggest that you consult a doctor who can suggest options that will hopefully lead to conception. In the meantime, show your wife love both in word and deed. There is no better therapy than affirmation. email print email print

Two children were burnt to death while their mother is hospitalised after a fire broke out at Shauri Moyo, Nairobi. Anthony Wambua, 5, and Willy Mutua, 2, were sleeping on Monday at their home in Jua Kali slums when the fire broke out at 7.30 pm, consuming 10 structures. Nairobi County Police Commander Japhet Koome said the fire was put out by the City County fire brigade but not before it burnt several people. “The woman is out of danger,” Mr Koome said, adding that the bodies of the two children had been taken to the City Mortuary. In Dagoretti, police are holding a man who allegedly stabbed another to death in a bar brawl. MAN STABBED The man stabbed Mr Eric Ndungi in his left thigh and abdomen.

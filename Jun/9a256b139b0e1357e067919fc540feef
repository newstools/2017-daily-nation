Officers from the Anti-Narcotics Police Unit in Mombasa on Friday morning arrested two Nigerian nationals found with 1.5kg of heroin estimated to be worth Sh4.5 million. The arrests followed a raid in an apartment in Nyali. Chukwu James and Gageche Gold Patience were arrested as they were packing the drugs in readiness for a trip to Brussels, Belgium, in the morning.   Police say the couple had concealed the narcotics in a suitcase and were destined for Brussels. Sources told the Nation that the drugs are suspected to have originated from Tanzania. The police are expected to issue a formal statement later in the day.

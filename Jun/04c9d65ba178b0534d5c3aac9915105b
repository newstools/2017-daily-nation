Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) is on the spot after hippopotamuses attacked and killed two people in Nyahururu. The incidents which happened in the last two days have left residents of Manguo Estate in the outskirts of Nyahururu town living in fear. “We are warning residents against walking near the New KCC factory after darkness because this is the time when the animals come out of their hiding,” said Nyandarua North OCPD, Timon Odingo who confirmed the attacks. Mr David Maina, 30, met his death on Saturday night after a hippo attacked him and killed him on the spot. The deceased who was a hawker in Nyahururu town was walking home on a footpath near the New KCC factory when he was attacked by the animal suspected to have strayed from River Ewaso Ng’iro. SEEK HELP On Tuesday morning, a 40-year-old man identified as Joseph Mwangi was attacked and killed when he encountered a group of hippos as he headed to Nyahururu town. “It is suspected a hippo that has a young one among the group could be the one attacking people,” said the Nyandarua North OCPD who confirmed both incidents. In the Tuesday morning incident, police had to seek help from KWS since a group of ten hippos were still hovering around the body of the deceased. “The KWS had to drive the animals back to their habitat near Manguo village, to allow the police to remove the body,” said the police boss. Leaders and residents have called on KWS to prevent more deaths. “It is so painful losing innocent people as a result of the human-wildlife conflict. We are demanding that action be taken by the charged authorities to avert more deaths,” said Mr Nelson Mbari, a youth leader.

The International Cricket Council granted Ireland and Afghanistan full Test status this week, meaning the two countries can now play Test matches against the world’s elite countries. The two become the first countries to receive Test status since Bangladesh in 2000, bringing the number of Test-playing nations to 12. This is significant for Kenya. It provides lessons on what we must do to raise the game to great heights. It is pertinent to recall that Kenya was on the verge of gaining the Test status in 2000 alongside Bangladesh but it didn’t happen. Kenya and Afghanistan were at par then, but now they are miles apart. The growth of cricket in Afghanistan has been particularly astonishing, given that most players learnt the game in refugee camps. Despite being ravaged by war, Afghanistan has invested heavily in cricket infrastructure and talent development. Contrastingly, Kenya has fallen from grace since their 2003 World Cup semi-final appearance. It is time local authorities invested in revamping cricket so that we can compete among the elite.

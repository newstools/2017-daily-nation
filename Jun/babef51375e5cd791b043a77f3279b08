Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Peter Kenneth has told off his critics in the Jubilee Party, saying they will not get an opportunity to rig him out in the August 8 elections. Mr Kenneth, who spoke on Wednesday with a group of supporters in Makadara, said he is happy that he was rigged out in the Jubilee nominations because he now has an easy task to win the Nairobi governor’s seat without being affiliated with a particular party. “I thank God they did that so that I may leave the Jubilee party, I am now more comfortable to seek this seat as an independent candidate,” he said. Mr Kenneth said the outcome of the nominations, which he said were marred by irregularities, presented him an opportunity to get supporters from all major political parties. MASTERMIND “I'm an independent candidate with an independent mind and therefore my supporters are free to elect a president of their choice,” he said. The gubernatorial aspirant was defeated by Senator Mike Sonko in the Jubilee primaries. Last week, Mr Kenneth accused Deputy President William Ruto of being the mastermind behind alleged rigging that saw him lose to Mr Sonko. “This time round there will be no hired voters who will be ferried from one polling station to another to vote someone as they did during the Jubilee party nominations. "We will face off with one another in the elections and I am confident I will win the elections,” said Mr Kenneth. He told his supporters to ignore those saying his bid will divide votes. “Those telling my people that they should not divide votes must know that people will choose a leader of their choice,” he said Mr Kenneth accused Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero of misusing county funds and failing to implement projects.He promised to recover all grabbed land and other public utilities and also fight corruption in City Hall.

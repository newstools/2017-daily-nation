SHANGHAI Brazil's Oscar was banned for eight games Thursday for triggering a mass brawl in the Chinese Super League between his Shanghai SIPG side and opponents Guangzhou R&F. After the former Chelsea midfielder appeared twice to fire the ball deliberately at Guangzhou players on Sunday, he was rushed by several opponents. Oscar fell to the ground and a melee broke out. The Chinese Football Association issued lengthy bans to four players, including Oscar, and fined him 40,000 yuan ($6,000). Oscar is one of the most high-profile players in the Chinese Super League after he joined SIPG for an Asian-record 60 million euros this season.   He deliberately lashed the ball twice at R&F players.

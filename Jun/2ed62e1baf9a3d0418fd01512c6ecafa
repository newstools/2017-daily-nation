SAN FRANCISCO NBA All-Star guard Stephen Curry, who helped the Golden State Warriors capture their second title in three seasons this month, will play in a second-tier professional golf tournament in August. The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player will compete August 3-6 at the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic in suburban San Francisco, playing as an amateur on a sponsor exemption. "People asking why I'm playing. Unexpected invite & Always a dream 2 play golf w/ the pros. WebDotComTour has so much talent it's unreal," Curry tweeted about playing. "Obviously want to play well & see how I handle tournament golf. No expectations except keep ball out of the gallery and not go Happy Gilmore."The event benefits the Warriors' charity foundation. "I'm honoured to have the opportunity to play with the pros, not only to be able to compete against some of the best golfers in the world," Curry, who has a handicap of 2.2, said. "Golf has always been a passion of mine and it's a dream come true to get the chance to play inside the ropes amongst the pros." Curry, 29, has played for the Warriors since 2009.   Curry claimed the top spot with Cleveland star LeBron James second.

We are still living in a largely patriarchal society that is not news. What a lot of women who support equality of the sexes may not know is that in their everyday actions, they may be furthering the male advantage. Findings of a new study unearth one such action that is continually done by women.Findings of the controversial study by University of Chicago in the US have found that single women are continually downplaying their ambitions so that they can seem as more desirable partners to the opposite sex.In the study, researchers asked a group of students from an unnamed elite MBA programme to answer questions about themselves and about their career preferences. The survey then asked both male and female students to rate their own levels of ambition, assertiveness and competitiveness, to write down their desired salary rates and to indicate whether or not they would take up jobs that require them to travel extensively. One group of students was told that their answers would be shared with their classmates while the other was told that the answers would only be seen by faculty members.DIFFERENT RESPONSESThe researchers observed when women were told that their answers would be seen by their classmates, they asked for a much smaller salary, said they would not want a job that involved a lot of travelling and also said they wanted a job where they would work fewer days a week. This is in sharp contrast to women whose answers were to be seen by only faculty members who asked for a bigger paycheck and expressed willingness to work as many hours and travel as extensively as the men studied.Interestingly, women already in relationships did not change their answers when they were told that their classmates would see them.The explanationOn analysing the findings, the researchers concluded that because the single women may see their male classmates as potential romantic mates, they downplayed their ambitions and assertiveness. Single women are changing their answers because they think it s going to hurt them in the marriage market. Because they are interested in dating these men, they would not want to send that signal of ambition and assertiveness, says Amanda Pallais, one of the study authors.Turns out that these fears that women have of seeming unattractive for being too assertive are not imaginary. A 2015 study by Harvard University showed that men, even those who are highly educated, prefer a female partner who is less ambitious than them. email print email print

Counties will be required to seek the approval of the Controller of Budget to withdraw money raised from levies such as land rates and licences if a government Bill becomes law. This follows proposed amendments to the public finance law which gives the Controller of Budget oversight over cash held by counties in bank accounts. The law is silent on whether counties can tap into money they collect as rates, parking fees and business permits held in banks before their transfer to their main account at the central bank. The Constitution requires that all revenues generated be paid into the main accounts where approval of the budget is given before the cash is released for spending.

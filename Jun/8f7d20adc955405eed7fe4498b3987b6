Ulinzi Stars striker Stephen Waruru is the SportPesa Premier League Player of the Month for April. He beat Posta Rangers keeper Patrick Matasi to the award that comes with a cash prize of Sh100,000 reward, a trophy and a 49-inch LG TV. The Kenyan international netted four times in the month of April to bag the award. He opened his account against champions Tusker FC in a 1-1 draw, then grabbed a brace in a 5-1 mauling of Mathare United and wound up the month with another a goal against Western Stima at home. The striker has dedicated the award to soldiers in Somalia, the technical bench, teammates and his family. “Above all I want to dedicate this award to my fellow soldiers at the war front. They are forever remembered and we always pray for them. I also dedicate this to my teammates, the technical bench, my wife and kid. They have supported me so much,” Waruru said. “This award is a huge motivation for me and it will push me to work harder.” Other players that had been nominated for the award were Joackins Atudo (Posta Rangers), Luke Ochieng (Posta Rangers) and Gilbert Fiamenyo (AFC Leopards). Nzoia Sugar's Brian Otieno won the March award.

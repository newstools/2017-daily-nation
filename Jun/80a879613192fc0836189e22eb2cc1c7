Ninety-two youths have been arrested for presenting fake Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) admission letters at the Recruits Training School in Eldoret. They were arrested on Sunday when they went to the school with the letters which were later found to be fake. On Tuesday, they appeared in court where they denied the charges and were released on a Sh10,000 bond. Confirming the incident, Eldoret West Police Boss Samuel Mutunga said that the suspects recorded statements with the police before they appeared in court on Tuesday. “We arrested 92 suspects on Sunday at Moi Barracks Recruitment Training School in the outskirts of Eldoret Town and they have appeared today before Eldoret Resident Magistrate Harrison Baraza where they were charged for being in procession of fake recruitment documents and released on bond,” Mr Mutunga told the Nation on phone. Mr Mutunga cautioned members of the public to be on the lookout and report people purporting to be able to recruit youths to join KDF. The case will be mentioned on Friday.

Police are looking for a man who allegedly killed his wife and a child and buried them in a shallow grave in Gitaraka village, Mbeere, Embu County. The 40-year-old man is said to have killed the woman during a domestic row over the toddler, aged about two and a half years. Officials suspect the killings happened on Saturday, saying that is the day the woman, who they said usually takes part in many public activities, went missing. “The man said the wife travelled to Machakos, where her parents live, but he has since gone at large,” said Karaba Chief Stephen Nzioka. Mr Nzioka said residents became suspicious when children showed them a trench he had dug a few metres from the main house. The administrator said the grave was discovered on Monday afternoon, and police would today seek a court order to exhume the bodies. He said the nature of the disagreement had not yet been established, but residents say the couple had been been squabbling for some time.

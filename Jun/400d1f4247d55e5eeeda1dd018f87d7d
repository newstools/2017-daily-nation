Athletics Kenya has named a strong team of 49 athletes that is a blend of youth and experience to represent the country at the London World Championships from August 4-13. The team has six out of the seven champions from the 2015 Beijing World Championships. However, it won’t be that easy for Kenya, which topped the medal standings for the first time in Beijing, amassing seven gold, six silver and three bronze medals. David Rudisha (800m), Asbel Kiprop (1,500m) Ezekiel Kemboi (3,000m steeplechase), Nicholas Bett (400m hurdles), Julius Yego (javelin) and Havyin Kiyeng (3,000m steeplechase) will be in the London-bound team. RIGHT TRAINING A repeat performance is possible with the right training. The athletes’ dedication, hard work and discipline will be crucial. We believe head coach Julius Kirwa, who has had a Midas touch with the team, is again raring to go. But coach Kirwa, who handled the team to its best outings at the 2008 Beijing and 2016 Rio Olympics Games besides the 2015 Beijing Worlds, will need support from fellow coaches, athletes, Athletics Kenya and other stakeholders. The athletes must minimise their participation in competitions abroad to avoid burnout. Some of the stars, including Kiprop, Kemboi and Rudisha, are not in their best form now, but we believe they will peak on time.

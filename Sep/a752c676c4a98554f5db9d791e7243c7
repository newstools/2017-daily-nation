LONDON Britain's Andy Murray said on Wednesday he is unlikely to play again this season due to a hip injury that forced him to pull out of the US Open. "Unfortunately, I won't be able to compete in the upcoming events in Beijing and Shanghai, and most likely, the final two events to finish the season in Vienna and Paris due to my hip injury which has been bothering me the last few months," the three-time Grand Slam champion said on his Facebook page.   US ninth seed Williams is seeking her third US Open crown.

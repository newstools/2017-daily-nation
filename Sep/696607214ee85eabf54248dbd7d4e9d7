Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) won Prinsloo Sevens title a second time after beating hosts Nakuru 29-5 in a mouthwatering final at Nakuru Athletic Club on Sunday. Handled by former Kenya Sevens forward Dennis Mwanja, the bankers nailed down four tries with a brace from Shaban Ahmed as they rallied from 0-5 down to reclaim the title they last won in 2013. Nakuru led by Kenya Sevens forward, Oscar Ouma, took command of the game as early as the third minute when fellow Kenya Sevens player Nelson Oyoo danced through his markers to drill home a superb try. Geoff Ominde failed to convert. KCB went on the hunt after the break and their efforts paid off when the speedy Ahmed went for a massive try to lay the ground for more points for KCB, the 2013 and 2014 National Sevens Series champions.  The Great Rift side failed to contain the Lions, with Jacob Ojee weaving his way past Nakuru defenders to score their second try, which Ahmed converted. Ahmed proved the destroyer when he evaded his marker for another masterpiece of a try, and he beautifully converted for a 14-5 lead as frustration set in for Nakuru, with home defeat looming.  KCB’s Michael Wanjala inflicted more pain on KCB when he stormed through Nakuru defence to score a try but Ahmed failed to add the extras. Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde, who was playing for the first time this season, finished off a good run for his side as he buried the winning try below the posts. Mwanja attributed the victory to improved training ahead of the tournament. “The team was just marvellous as it was cohesive, sharp in attack and were hungry for tries. They did not disappoint,” said Mwanja. The Series move to Eldoret Sports Club for the inaugural Sepetuka Sevens this weekend.

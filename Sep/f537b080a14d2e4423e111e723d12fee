A man being held by police in Riruta, Nairobi, will now be charged with killing his stepdaughter and dumping her body in Ngong Forest. On August 27, Mr Stephen Otieno was charged with abducting the child. He, however, denied the charge and was remanded in police custody to assist police trace the girl or her body. MURDERParts of the girl’s body were found in the forest last week, a month after she disappeared. This led the prosecutor to tell a Kibera court Monday that Mr Otieno would be charged with the murder of the three-year-old. Last week, detectives told the court that the suspect took them to a spot in Thogoto Forest where they found his national identity card, his mobile phone and some of the girl’s clothes. MISSINGMr Otieno is said to have left his house in Satellite with the child on August 18 when the mother was at work. He returned in the wee hours of August 19 without the girl and told his wife she was on her way home. Later in the day, a relative called to inform her of a chilling letter her husband had written and she went to police. The case will be mentioned on October 5.

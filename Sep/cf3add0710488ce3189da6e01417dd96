Brenda, I need help.I am married to a 54-year-old man. I am having an affair because he doesn t satisfy me sexually. We have a two-year-old child and I am a stay-at-home mother. My husband gives me everything but sexual satisfaction. Should I challenge him with the stories I hear in the media of very strong men in bed?A man is as big as his ego. Never forget that. If you throw stories of other men in his face, which might just mean the end of the two of you.Be more tactful, you are a woman after all, that shouldn t be very hard. Talk to him about it, gently. Suggest that the two of you try new things in the bedroom, playfully. Show your man how to please you.Before all this though, end the affair. No good can come out of it.Do you have feedback on this story? E-mail: [email&#160;protected] email print email print I am a stay-at-home mum yet he leaves me only 300 bob daily.

The RBA said the course will be offered in collaboration with College of Insurance, with the curriculum targeting pension schemes trustees’ administration skills ready for rollout. “This is part of our process of vetting trustees, where we are taking an additional step of training them. We have a five-day programme which is being run by the College of Insurance, using a curriculum which was developed to ensure that the board of trustees continue to enhance their skills,” said RBA’s manager in charge of market conduct Tom Kiptanui.

LAHOREGroundsmen are rolling down the pitches, welders are repairing barbed wire, and workers are splashing on a new coat of paint at Pakistan's centrepiece Gaddafi Stadium, which has witnessed both history and controversy - and is now preparing to retake cricket's world stage.Next week the ground will ring out with the sound of Pakistan's national anthem once more as the home team takes on a star-studded World XI, the highest-profile international fixture in the country since a deadly militant attack eight years ago.This picture taken on September 7, 2017 shows ground staff preparing the cricket pitch of the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.

PHOTO | AAMIR QURESHI | AFPThe three-match Twenty20 series will be played under tight security but it is, officials hope, a new chapter for Pakistani cricket - and for the Gaddafi Stadium's bloody, scandal-plagued and, at times, glorious story.Named after the Libyan leader who met a grisly end at the hands of rebel fighters, the ground has seen a World Cup final and militant attack, and has been caught up in Pakistan's nuclear ambitions and geopolitical rivalries.It is at the heart of the most tragic incident in Pakistan's sporting history, after the Sri Lankan team had to be airlifted to safety when militants attacked their team bus near the stadium in 2009.The attack, which killed eight people and wounded nine, drove international cricket and most other sports from the militancy-plagued country, forcing Pakistan to host its "home" fixtures in neutral venues. The 27,000-capacity venue has still seen moments of glory even since its peak when it hosted the 1996 World Cup final, won by Sri Lanka against Australia.Pakistani policemen patrol during a a practice session of Pakistan's national cricket team at the Gaddafi Cricket Stadium in Lahore on September 7, 2017, for the forthcoming World XI tour to Pakistan.

"We are starting a new life," he told AFP.This picture taken on September 7, 2017 shows spokesperson of the Pakistani Cricket Board (PCB) Amjad Hussain speaking during an interview with AFP at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.

Others took a more cheerful view. "It's the best stadium in Pakistan," said Tauseef Sadozai, manager of the nearby Dawat-e-Khas restaurant. "This venue has missed a lot of cricket.... Losing a few days of business isn't greater than losing international cricket."Pakistani cricket captain Sarfraz Ahmed (centre) and teammate Ahmed Shahzad (top right) run during a practice session at the Gaddafi Cricket Stadium in Lahore on September 7, 2017, for the forthcoming World XI tour to Pakistan.

Four other players have been investigated.As for the name, the PCB's new chief Najam Sethi last year called for the stadium to be rebranded in tribute to the late founder of Pakistan's largest welfare organisation, Abdul Sattar Edhi.This picture taken on September 7, 2017 shows photographs of former Pakistani Test cricketers displayed in a lobby of the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.

"But no decision was taken." email print email print

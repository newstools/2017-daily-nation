It was the end of an era for firebrand Stephen Soi and James Chacha when they were barred from taking part in the National Olympic Committee of Kenya(Nock) elections on Friday. Soi and Chacha couldn't defend their positions as deputy treasurer and secretary respectively after the Kenya Taekwondo Federation, who proposed them, were knocked out from the Elective General Assembly following orders from Sports Disputes Tribunal and High Court. What sealed their fate was the move by the International Olympic Committee member Sam Ramsamy move to bring order to the meeting affirming that the tribunal and court orders had to be respected. "We obeyed the court orders that stopped the process on May 5 why can't we respect them now," said Ramsamy, who represented IOC president Thomas Bach.Chacha and Soi have been officials at Nock for over 20 years.  Ben Ekumbo, who was due to defend his seat at deputy vice president, was also knocked out by the court order. 
  
This after the General Assembly knocked out his competitor Patrick Muyah's candidature.

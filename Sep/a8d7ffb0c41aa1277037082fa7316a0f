Western Bulls and Kenyatta University’s Blak Blad claimed stunning victories on Saturday as Eldoret came alive with the inaugural Sepetuka Sevens, the first ever National Sevens Series event to be staged in the region. Western Bulls stunned Strathmore 14-7 in Pool “D” duel while Blak Blad rocked favourite Nondescripts in Pool “B” duel. Western Bulls might have failed to uphold the fire from Leos’ victory, going down to Kabras Sugar 45-5 but their 22-7 victory against Makueni saw them reach their first Cup quarters this season. Bulls affirmed their qualification after Kabras Sugar tamed Strathmore Leos 17-0 in their last Pool match. Western Bulls will now meet Kabeberi Sevens champions Impala Saracens while Kabras are up against Kenya Commercial Bank in the Cup quarters. Impala Saracens beat KCB 29-5 and Catholic Monks 29-5 before downing Mwamba 15-10 to sail through as Pool “A” while hosts and the Series defending champions Homeboyz also through to Cup quarters. Blak Blad almost upheld their fairytale against Kabeberi Sevens losing finalists Menengai Oilers but went down 26-24. Their hopes of making their maiden Cup quarters this season went up in smoke after they lost to Nakuru 22-7. Oilers, who beat Nakuru 17-12, booked a place in the Cup quarterfinals, after they beat Nondies 37-7 in their last match. Oiletrs will face Quins while Nakuru will take on hosts Homeboyz in the other Cup quarters. Homeboyz Deejays danced around Mount Kenya University-Thika 29-10 before beating the University of Nairobi’s Mean Machine 26-12. They whacked Quins 37-5 but both teams qualified after Quins had earlier beaten Machine 26-0 and MKU Thika 33-7 respectively. It’s Kennedy Njoroge, who gave Thika a 5-0 with a converted try before Kenya Sevens star August Lugonzo hit back for Homeboyz to level with a try after a superb offload from Michael Wanjala, who failed to add the extra. Jeff Oluoch gave Homeboyz the lead 12-5 at the break with a try that Wanjala made no other mistake to convert.  Thika university students stared at the biggest upset of the Series when Bob Muhati’s try inched them closer 10-12. However, Oluoch and Wanjala scored a try each to propel Homeboyz to victory.

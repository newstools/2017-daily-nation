President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that even if Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga wins the October 17 repeat poll, Jubilee has the numbers to impeach him in less than three months. He did not elaborate the reasons that would lead to the impeachment. The President said Jubilee, which has the majority of members in both Houses of Parliament, can make amendments to the Constitution based on its numbers. “If Raila is elected how will he lead? How? In the last Senate we could not pass Bills…but presently, we can do business without a single Nasa member. In the National Assembly, with over 200 members we are 13 members shy of a two-thirds majority meaning we can change the Constitution. “We have to tell Kenyans the truth. Even if he is elected we have the opportunity in Parliament within two [to] three months to impeach him,” Mr Kenyatta said. He spoke Monday during a meeting with Kamba leaders at State House. The law says a president can be impeached on grounds of a gross violation of a provision of the Constitution or of any other law, where there are serious reasons for believing that the President has committed a crime under national or international law or for gross misconduct. The president also dared Nasa MPs and senators to skip the first sitting of the 12th Parliament Tuesday, saying his party has enough numbers to conduct House business. He said it is their constituents who would lose out if they do not attend Parliament.   Wetang'ula says Uhuru has no powers to open 12th Parliament.

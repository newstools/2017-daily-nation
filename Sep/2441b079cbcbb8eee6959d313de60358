Senior citizens who are among the most dependent people in society are often not accorded the support they deserve. Cases of elderly people being neglected by the very people they brought up are commonplace, and Kenyans need to combine efforts towards guaranteeing every older person a comfortable life regardless of his or her background. The remarkable story of a woman in Nyeri County who has dedicated her life to taking care of the elderly, which is elsewhere in this edition, should set an example to Kenyans today as the world marks the International Day of Older Persons. GOOD LIVING CONDITIONS Her story illustrates that it does not require much to provide good living conditions. With the United Nations Division for Social Policy and Development Ageing indicating that by 2030 there will be more elderly people than those aged between 15 and 24 globally, the earlier Kenyansâ€™ collective mindset is steered towards being more sensitive to the elderly, the better for society. Last week, one of the items in a budget the Cabinet approved is Sh6.5 billion for the enhanced Inua Jamii programme that offers a monthly stipend for Kenyans aged 70 and above. While the gesture is laudable, the fact that the approval was lumped with other allocations perceived to be a political selling point sends a message that matters of senior citizens can be used to win political mileage. Let us spare a thought for the elderly and work at improving their livelihoods.

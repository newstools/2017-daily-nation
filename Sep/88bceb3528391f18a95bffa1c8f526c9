Officials from the Confederation of Africa Football are expected in Kenya on Monday for the third and final inspection of facilities for next year’s African Nations Championship (Chan). Four stadiums— Kasarani in Nairobi, Meru, Machakos and Eldoret —  have been earmarked for the tournament scheduled for January 12 to February 4. The question is; are they up to international standards? In their last visit last June, the African football governing body officials were not satisfied with the country’s state of preparedness, especially the slow pace of renovating the stadiums. Apart from the Kasarani and Meru stadiums, work at the others is way behind schedule. EXPRESS CONFIDENCE Meanwhile, top government officials continue to express confidence that everything will be ready before January. Yet more needs to be done to convince the confederation that Kenya is indeed able to host the competition. The delegates need to be persuaded that stadium safety and security have been adequately covered. It will be embarrassing if the country fails to host this tournament, with memories of the bungled Cup of Nations finals in 1996 — when the hosting rights were given to South Africa due to Kenya’s  lack of commitment— still fresh. More recently, the country successfully hosted IAAF World Under-18 Championships in July. We have absolutely no reason to let this one slip away.

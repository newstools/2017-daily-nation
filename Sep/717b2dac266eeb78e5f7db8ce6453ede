Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has asked the High Court to strike out a petition by former Labour Cabinet Secretary Kazungu Kambi challenging his election, saying it lacks merit. Through lawyer Dennis Mosota, Mr Kingi said the omission of date of declaration of results in Mr Kambi’s documents renders the case defective and incompetent. “The petition does not show the number of votes cast in favour of each of the candidates who participated in the questioned election, the total votes cast in the election is also missing,” the governor said in his application. FLAWSHe argued that going for a full hearing of the petition without first hearing his application will be contrary to the rule of natural justice. Justice Weldon Korir on Friday directed Mr Kambi’s petition be enjoined with that of a Jubilee Party supporter, Mr William Kahindi, who has also challenged Mr Kingi’s victory. Both Mr Kambi and Mr Kahindi, who is represented by lawyer Yusuf Aboubakar, have challenged Mr Kingi’s election citing irregularities and illegalities in the August 8 polls. CHEBUKATIMr Kahindi, who is Jubilee pointman Gideon Mung’aro's supporter, also urged the court to enjoin the electoral commission chairman Wafula Chebukati while consolidating the case. County Returning Officer, Ms Nelly Illongo, represented by lawyer Sanjeev Khagram and the electoral commission, are accused of presiding over illegalities. Justice Korir ordered the petitioners and respondents to file submissions and responses in three days. The hearing of the case was slated for November 6 to 12.

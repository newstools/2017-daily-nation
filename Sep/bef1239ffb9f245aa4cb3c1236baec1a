Former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim has filed a petition to challenge the election of Mr Aden Duale as Garissa Town MP. Mr Maalim is seeking to overturn National Assembly Majority Leaderâ€™s win on grounds that his election was flawed. He alleged that Mr Duale was not validly elected as the poll was marred with massive irregularities. Mr Maalim wants court to direct that the respondents in the case jointly and several committed election irregularities. He wants the court to order the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to avail all voting material including voter registers, counterfoils used for all polling stations, electronic devices and equipment used during the polls within 48 hours.

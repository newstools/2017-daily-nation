Issues of integrity, how to balance family life and legislative work and how to relate with ambassadors are some of the topics that MPs will be taught during their one-week induction course set to begin on Sunday. The National Assembly has invited a wide range of speakers drawn from various fields of expertise to address the MP in a bid to open up their minds on matters pertaining to their legislative role. The induction under the theme ‘Setting the stage for the twelfth Parliament, preparing for a smooth take off’, will take place in Nairobi from September 17 to 22. The induction will come five days after President Uhuru Kenyatta addressed a joint sitting on Tuesday. WABUKALA Among those who will address the MPs is chairman of the Ethics and Antic-Corruption Commission (EACC), Dr Eliud Wabukala and Dr Julius Kipng’etich, the CEO of Uchumi Supermarkets. Former long serving head of public service during President Moi’s regime, Dr Sally Kosgei, will handle the topic of foreign relations and diplomacy for legislators. The Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai said all MPs have been invited and they expect a 100 percent turnout. “It is important to teach our MPs how to relate with ambassadors whenever they are outside the country,” said Sialai. ETIQUETTE Professor Okoth Okombo from the University of Nairobi will address the MPs on etiquette, decorum and public relations. “We encourage even members who are serving their third and fourth term to attend the induction because there are a lot of new developments which can be of benefit to them,” Mr Sialai said. The 12th Parliament has 180 newly elected MPs who will benefit from the induction course as they may have no background knowledge in legislation. The MPs will also be taken through various aspects relating to their constitutional duties such as the House Standing Orders, committee system, the formulation of laws as well as legislative budget.   Most MCAs also arrived improperly dressed in the assembly.

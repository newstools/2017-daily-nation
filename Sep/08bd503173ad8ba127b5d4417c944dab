The government plans to introduce smart trackers to curb proliferation of faulty and half-filled liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders. Under the arrangement, marketers and the government will monitor the refill, sale and distribution of cylinders, thereby providing them with crucial data on cooking gas usage and movement. This creates a new avenue for State agencies to crack down on cartels that endanger lives through supply of half-filled and defective cylinders. The new strategy, announced by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum on Monday, pins down individual LPG refill companies on culpability in case of a gas explosion at premises, unlike the present scenario where scores of unlicensed LPG refillers compete with the official 44 refillers in the business. The unlicensed LPG refillers who operate across the country at undesignated points use branded LPG cylinders which they sneak into the market.

Clifton Miheso asserts that the forthcoming international friendlies against Iraq and Thailand will provide an ideal build-up for Kenya ahead of the forthcoming competitive assignment against Ghana. The Zambian based winger is part of the 24-man released on Friday by Harambee Stars coach Stanley Okumbi, for the games against the Asian opponents on October 5 and 8 respectively.  "These friendlies are helping us a great deal," the left footed winger, who is a regular at top flight side Buildcon explained. "You know we need to train together and play a couple of matches, this will help us approach the match against Ghana with some confidence." Kenya will face the West African giants in Nairobi in March in a must-win 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match. Okumbi has omitted captain Victor Wanyama, Ayub Timbe and Brian Mandela from his squad. The squad however boasts of some big-name players including Spanish based forward Micheal Olunga and Zesco United's Jesse Were.  Kenya settled for a one-all draw with Mozambique in Maputo in the team's last friendly in August.

Hi Brenda,I’m a 23-year-old virgin man. Whenever I get into a relationship and reveal this fact about me to a woman, she leaves. Is it so bad to be a virgin? What can I do?  There is nothing wrong with being a virgin at 23. If sexual purity is important to you, hold onto it. You might be judged harshly for it so you also need to grow a thick skin. The only problem here seems to be your choice of dates. Remember that in life, different people hold different values. You seem to be going for women who prefer more sexually experienced men thus the constant heart break. Try changing your circles. Try hanging around with values similar to yours. You will eventually meet a woman who will not leave.  Got a problem to share with Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com 
  
I am worried because I do not know where this ‘relationship’ is headed.

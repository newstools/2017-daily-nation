MADRID Chris Froome became just the third rider in history to win the Vuelta a Espana and Tour de France in the same year as Matteo Trentin won the 21st stage of the Vuelta through the centre on Madrid on Sunday. Froome beat four-time Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali by over two minutes with Russia's Ilnur Zakarin completing the podium.

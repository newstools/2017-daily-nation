From teen stars Millie Bobby Brown to Kiernan Shipka, comedian Kate McKinnon or Indian mega-star Priyanka Chopra, it was a dazzle of white on the Emmys red carpet on Sunday night. New York's Fashion Week wrapped up days ago in a whirl of colour, but for television's big night in Los Angeles, monochrome was the name of the game - and white was triumphant. Setting the tone, the 13-year-old Stranger Things star Brown delighted the crowd in a strapless white Calvin Klein gown, whose layered tulle skirt gave her the look of a fairy-tale princess - a world away from the sci-fi-horror drama that earned her a best supporting actress nomination.   Emmys favourite Elisabeth Moss - crowned best actress in a drama for the dystopian The Handmaid's Tale - wore a pale blush strapless midi dress, whose retro feel harked back to her Mad Men days. Moss's Mad Men co-star - the 15-year-old Shipka, who came of age as Don Draper's daughter Sally - sparkled in a Miu Miu gown of translucent ivory, with plunging neckline, jeweled straps and belt.   Kate McKinnon tearfully accepted the award for best supporting actress in a comedy series for her portrayal of Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live, in a strapless black bodice and floor-length white skirt. And Bollywood's Chopra stunned in a jewel-encrusted white mermaid gown from Balmain, its feathered tail fanning out on the carpet.   Veep star Anna Chlumsky was channeling a mermaid of a different kind: in a floor-length sequined number whose metallic tone - and generous cleavage - was mirrored in the gown worn by Orange Is The New Black star Laverne Cox. And Uzo Aduba - a fellow star of the acclaimed prison drama - cut a similarly voluptuous figure in a two-piece spaghetti-strap gown of striped white and shimmering silver.

Kenya borrowed Sh430.6 billion in the five months to June, highlighting the Jubilee administration’s appetite for foreign money to finance mega infrastructure projects. The Treasury signed a total of 29 new loans involving bilateral, multilateral and commercial creditors. “The proceeds from all the facilities (Sh430.6 billion) are expected to finance development projects to achieve the country’s development agenda,” said Treasury secretary Henry Rotich in a report to Parliament on all new loans contracted by the government  from February 1 to June 30, 2017. “The funds are mainly to fund infrastructure projects including roads, irrigated water and water supply, energy, health and education.”Kenya has ramped up spending in recent years to build a modern railway, new roads and electricity plants, driving up the budget deficit. The World Bank recently warned that the country’s growing appetite for loans, especially Chinese debt, risks hurting the economy.

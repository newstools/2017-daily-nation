Former Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo was on Wednesday charged with abuse of office in a case filed by the anti-graft agency. The court heard that during his term, Mr Doyo issued appointment letters to eight senior officers without the approval of the County Public Board. ABSENT The governor also did not adhere to the Transitional Authority circular, the court was told. Mr Doyo, who neither appeared nor sent a lawyer to represent him in court, faces eight counts in a case filed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). The eight counts of abuse of office include appointment of Mr Adan Santura, Mr Ben Omondi, Ms Lucy Mworia and Mr Kinoti Kithinji on various dates in 2014. Mr Omondi, Ms Mworia and Mr Kithinji were appointed as external liaison officer, coordinator in the office of Culture/Gender and Youth Affairs and director of communications, respectively. CO-ACCUSED Others appointed improperly, according to the prosecution, are Ms Lilian Kiruja, Mr Guyo Adi and Mr Salad Kikuyu Sarite. The former governor is co-accused with two other officers. Isiolo Chief Magistrate Samuel Mungai ruled that the governor be issued with summons to appear before the court on September 27 when the case will be mentioned.

County health officials said the 20 officers from Bura NYS camp have been admitted to the Bura Sub-County Hospital. According to Oscar Endekwa, the County Director for Public Health, 21 cholera cases have been reported in the county. Speaking to Nation in his office in Hola, Dr Endekwa said the situation at the NYS camp was under control. CONTROL “The officers are responding well to treatment. The other case is of a resident and he has been placed under treatment,” he said. He said the symptoms were noted on August 30, though they had not been confirmed, adding that health officials are investigating the cause of the disease. Besides isolating victims, Dr Endekwa said the county is also sensitising residents on hygiene and sanitation.  "We are trying to combat it before it spreads to a larger population," he added.  He asked residents to report any suspicious cases and urged them to drink clean water and wash their hands after visiting toilets.

Germany’s former national football team captain Lothar Herbert Matthäus arrives in Kenya next week for a series of coaching clinics. Matthäus, who captained West Germany to victory in the 1990 Fifa World Cup and was named European Footballer of the Year, will conduct three coaching clinics in Nairobi. The trip has been organised by Pay TV company StarTimes and the German top-flight football league popularly known as Bundesliga. Matthäus, who is the captain of the Bundesliga Legends Network, is scheduled to interact with young talent from Mathare Youth Sports Association, Riruta Youth and Star Soccer Academies on September 20 and 21 in Nairobi. Speaking on Monday in Nairobi, StarTimes director of Brand Marketing and Public Relations Japheth Akhulia said the company picked on Matthäus due to his glittering record, both for club and country, and expressed hope that Matthaus’ visit will impact the youth positively in all the three local academies. “Matthäus will be here as part of The Legends tour, and we believe that the young ones will benefit from technical advice that he will offer based on his impressive and lengthy  carreer in professional football,” Akhulia said. This will be the German legend’s first visit to Kenya, and he is also scheduled to meet Olympic Javelin silver medallist Julius Yego in his two-day tour. Matthäus played 464 Bundesliga games for Borusssia Monchengladbach and Bayern Munich, scoring 121 goals.

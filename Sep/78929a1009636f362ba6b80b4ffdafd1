Lamu residents continue to mourn the late Public Works Principal Secretary Mariam El Maawy and asked the State to consider selecting the new office bearer from the county in her honour. The PS, who was born in Lamu died on Wednesday at a South African hospital while undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in an Al-Shabaab attack at Milihoi area on the Lamu-Mpeketoni road on July 13 this year. Speaking to journalists in Lamu on Friday, residents termed the latel Maawy as a selfless leader, who was committed to serving the county and nation. Many of those interviewed said for over 50 years, Lamu County has been marginalized, especially in leadership in the national government. REPLACEMENT Save Lamu Civil Society Organisation chairman and Lamu elder Mr Mohamed Abubakar said Ms Maawy’s appointment was celebrated as she was the only appointee in the national government from the county. “It’s unfortunate to lose an educationist, mother, daughter and counsellor. We were proud of El Maawy. All we ask is that the President (Uhuru Kenyatta) considers appointing her replacement from here (Lamu). It will be a way of also honouring her and keeping her spirit alive,” said Mr Abubakar. Mr Yusuf Bwanamkuu said it was only fair for the late PSs replacement to come from Lamu. “It will be fair enough for the vacancy left due to the death of PS El Maawy to be filled by someone from Lamu. Other communities boast of having five or even ten people in top positions. We only had Mariam and now that she is gone,” said Mr Bwanamkuu. On Thursday, Lamu leaders led by Governor Fahim Twaha and former Women Representative and Wiper Democratic Movement Deputy Party Leader Ms Shakilla Abdalla eulogised the Ms Maawy as hardworking, dedicated woman and a role model for young girls in the county.

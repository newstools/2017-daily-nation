National Super Alliance (Nasa) co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has said his security detail has been withdrawn. Mr Musyoka has told the Nation that he was stripped of his bodyguards on Monday evening. His personal assistant Kelvin Kinengo said five security officers attached to Mr Raila Odinga’s running mate had been recalled to General Service Unit headquarters in Nairobi. However, police bosses have denied knowledge of the move. Deputy Inspector-General Joel Kitili said he was not aware of the officers’ recall. The development came on the day Mr Musyoka’s alliance was scheduled to stage demos in Nairobi to force out electoral commission officials accused of bungling August 8 presidential poll

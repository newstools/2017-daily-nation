Raila Odinga has reportedly chartered a jet for Ali Saleh Kiba to join him in thanksgiving celebrations. The "Seduce Me" hit-make will get the rare opportunity to hang out with Raila, or Joshua, as his supporters have recently nick-named him.It's not by chance, however, as it is well-known that AliKiba, a crowd-puller, played a critical role in galvanising support for NASA for his close ally ( and may we add, former heart throb- as Chilobae recently unseated him) Ali Hassan Joho.The two have been spotted severally in Dar es Salaam enjoying each other's company.Joho, who is fondly referred to as Governor 001, is a staunch NASA supporter. You will remember that Alikiba also accompanied Governor Joho when he went to collect his certificate of re-election.It is understood that after the Supreme Court nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta s win, Raila's Camp was full of praise for all who supported their cause. Attempts to reach Alikiba for a comment over the issue have been futile but his assistant manager at his recording label Rockstar4000, Aidan Charlie Sleeve, confirmed the reports. Ni kweli (Alikiba) ameitwa Kenya lakini nisingelipenda kulizungumzia hilo kwa udani. Kikubwa niwashukuru Watanzania na niwaombe tuendelee kuisapoti muziki mzuri kutoka kwa Kiba na wanamuziki wote wa Rockstar Aidan Charlie said. Yeah it's true Alikiba has been invited to Kenya but I wouldn t want to talk much about the visit. All in all I would like to thank all Tanzanians and ask them to continue supporting great music from Kiba and all artistes signed to Rockstar. email print email print

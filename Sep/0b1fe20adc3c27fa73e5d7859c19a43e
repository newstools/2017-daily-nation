Hi Brenda, I am a stay-at-home mother. My husband leaves me three hundred shillings for food in the morning and I feel like it is too little. Do you agree with me? How much do you think he should leave me every morning? I am not happy. Now, I need to get one thing in your head. Being a stay-at-home mother is not synonymous with being broke. Just because you do not have a job without your home does not mean that you can’t make any money. You, like thousands of other Kenyan women, could start a money making venture right from your living room. That said, if you still prefer that your husband leaves you money every morning, then how much he leaves is up to him and the depth of his pocket. The reason you feel so unhappy is probably because you are comparing yourself with other women. No two homes are the same. Do you have a problem to share with Just Brenda?

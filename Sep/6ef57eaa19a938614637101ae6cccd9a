Finally, order has been restored at the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) after Friday’s elections that saw former world marathon record holder Paul Tergat elected unopposed as president. The elections came after troubled times at Nock, the lowest moment being the mismanagement of Kenya’s athletes at last year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. A team appointed by the government to investigate the Rio fiasco revealed disturbing findings that pointed accusing fingers at sports managers, as well as Sports ministry officials. No action has been taken to date. Tergat’s immediate task will be to clean up the Rio mess and ensure Kenya is well prepared for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. We wish Tergat and his new team best of luck as they embark on this challenging journey.

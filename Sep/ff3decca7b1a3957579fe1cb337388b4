Sigoti Girls Secondary School in Nyakach, Kisumu County, has been closed down following fire incidents that razed two dormitories. One of the dormitories caught fire on Friday and the other Saturday morning around 8am. Principal Rose Ndiga said students in form one, two and three have been told to report back to school in a fortnight while those in form four are expected back after a week. "The damage is extensive and we have decided to send the girls home as we assess the damage and repair the dormitory to make it conducive again for our students," Ms Ndiga said. CASUALTIES County Commissioner Mohamed Maalim confirmed that there were no casualties. "We thank God because in the two fire incidences no student was hurt. We are continuing with investigations to establish the cause of the blaze," Mr Maalim said.

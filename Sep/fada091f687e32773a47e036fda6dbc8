An imposter lived, dined and mingled with Administration Police officers at Uhuru Camp, Nairobi, for six months undetected. The man, identified as Kennedy Mojong Ekale, 26, even had full AP uniform: a pair of jungle trousers and shirt, camouflage jacket, a belt, a lanyard, a hat and a raincoat. He also had two official T-shirts. Uhuru Camp normally hosts officers attached to the Securing of Government Buildings Unit, under which VIPs’ bodyguards also serve. NO FRIENDSPolice officers discovered something was amiss on Thursday. Ekale’s name was not on the duty schedule and he had never accompanied anyone on assignments. “This man has been putting on uniform, going out alone and coming back to the camp in the evening,” a constable said. He added that the imposter did not have friends. “I have never seen him with a gun but the whole thing is crazy. It means he has been seeing and hearing what he should not. "To think that a fake policeman spent time with officers who had guns and ammunition is scary,” the constable added. HOUSELang’ata OCPD Elijah Maina confirmed the arrest of Ekale. He was arraigned Monday for impersonation. Lang’ata Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss Samson Kiptum said Ekale was never allocated the house he used. House allocation is usually done with adherence to directions from seniors. WAIGANJOMr Kiptum told the Nation that the imposter claimed the uniform was inherited from his father who died years ago. “We want to know if there was such an officer. Even if it is true, it is still a crime for a civilian to have the uniforms,” he said.

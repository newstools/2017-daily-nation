HONG KONG South Korea squeezed unconvincingly into their ninth straight World Cup on Tuesday, as war-torn Syria scored a stoppage-time equaliser to secure a shock spot in the Asian play-offs. South Korea ground out a 0-0 draw against Uzbekistan to lock up second place in Group A, while Omar Al Soma's 93rd-minute goal gave Syria a 2-2 draw with Iran to finish third. Syria's heroics also extinguished China's faint hopes of reaching only their second World Cup, despite snatching a 2-1 win over 2022 hosts Qatar after Wu Lei's late winner. In Group B, Australia won 2-1 against Thailand but they will be knocked out of the second automatic qualifying spot if Saudi Arabia beat Japan in the evening's final game in Jeddah. The United Arab Emirates had a slim chance of reaching the play-offs, but their dream died when they lost 1-0 to Iraq to finish fourth in Group B.   Australia beat Thailand 2-1 in their final World Cup qualifying group game.

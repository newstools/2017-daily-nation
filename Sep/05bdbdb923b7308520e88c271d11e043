Mr Odinga on Tuesday said the protests aimed at forcing out IEBC officials accused of bungling August poll would continue next week in all county headquarters. REFORMS Protesters, Mr Odinga, said would take to the streets on Mondays and Fridays until IEBC chief exective Ezra Chiloba and 1o others vacate office. Speaking in Nairobi, Mr Odinga said Kenyans would not relent in pushing for reforms at the electoral commission. The Nasa presidential candidate said there would be no elections without reforms at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Mr Odinga was speaking at Okoa Kenya offices in Lavington when he met leaders from the Maa community from Laikipia, Samburu, Narok and Marsabit. On Monday, the protests were majorly peaceful in Kisumu but violence marred the demos held in the capital Nairobi. This was after Nasa supporters clashed with a group that branded itself as Nairobi Business Community near Anniversary Towers, the IEBC headquarters. Police also lobbed tear gas to disperse protesters who defied their orders not to take their protests to IEBC offices.  More follows.

Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior will Tuesday morning testify in an inquest formed to establish the cause of the death of his late father Mutula Kilonzo. Mr Kilonzo died at his home in April 2013 and an autopsy report tabled in court revealed that the late Makueni Senator died of massive bleeding caused by high blood pressure. The report was tabled by Dr S W Mwangi. Dr Mwangi said it was reported that Mr Kilonzo failed to wake up from his sleep. He told the inquest that the former lawmakerâ€™s son, Junior, and a farm worker, Mulei Mulwa, said he had not complained of any illness on April 16, 2013. Another witness had told the inquest that Mr Kilonzo had complained of fatigue and had lost weight before he died. Ms Stellar Mwendwa, who had worked as a Personal Secretary for Mr Kilonzo for ten years, said her boss had complained on several occasion of feeling tired. The witness attributed this to the grueling campaign.

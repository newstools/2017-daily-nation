Ukraine is angling to export maize to Kenya after the government allowed in more duty-free yellow maize for cattle feed manufacturing, as well as white maize for human consumption. This comes as maize supply in the country normalises. Ukraine announced on Tuesday last week that Kenya has extended duty-free purchase of yellow maize for one year and that of white maize up to end of next month. “The Government of Kenya has extended until June 30, 2018 the procedure for the duty-free purchase of “yellow” fodder maize for the needs of companies belonging to the Association of Millers and the Association of Feed Makers of Kenya,” the Kiev Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food was quoted by Ukrainian media. “The Government of Kenya also extended until September 30, 2017 the duty-free purchase of “white” food maize.” But farmers could face problems as the imports may hamper bid to cash in on higher prices as local maize finds its way to the market. As part of a government’s food subsidy programme, which sought to reverse the recent rise in prices of essential food commodities, the state in May partnered with various millers to offer white maize flour at subsidised rates across the country.

Ukraine, a former Soviet republic and a top global producers of corn, said it had already exported corn worth $17.5 million (about Sh1.8 billion) to Kenya this year. “This is 111,500 tonnes,” said the Ukranian ministry. The yellow maize must not be genetically modified and the exporting company should have a European Union certificate. The corn supplied must also meet Kenya’s quality standards.

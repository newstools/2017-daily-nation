Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria and former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama have been arrested for questioning over claims of hate speech. They were both questioned at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) headquarters. Mr Muthama was Monday arrested in his Kangundo home and taken to the DCI offices along Kiambu Road before being transferred to the Nairobi County police headquarters. Mr Kuria had been arrested earlier in the day in Nairobi. Earlier, the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) Chairman Francis ole Kaparo had indicated that they were investigating Mr Kuria and 277 other people for incitement and hate speech. Mr Kaparo said that if Mr Kuria will be found culpable, the commission will recommend his prosecution as stipulated by the NCIC Act. Last week, a video on social media showed Mr Kuria making vulgar utterances in Kikuyu against Nasa leader Raila Odinga. Meanwhile, Acting Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has said that the government will prosecute all hatemongers irrespective of their political affiliation. "Some people think that if they come from the ruling party, the law is not for them. We will be firm," said Dr Matiang’i on Monday.

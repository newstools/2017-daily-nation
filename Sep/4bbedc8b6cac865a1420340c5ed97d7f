Last year, Athletics Kenya came up with rules and regulations governing road races as part of its strategy to curb malpractices. These measures were taken in the wake of complaints of underage competitors taking part in the road races besides lack of proper remuneration. The rules largely touched on the age group that was permitted in the road races and prize money. However, some race organisers are flouting these rules and, despite getting huge sponsorships, still pay athletes much lower rates than those recommended in sports guidelines. In some races, the organisers have gone up to one year without paying the winners. MWEA HALF MARATHON For instance, organisers of the Mwea Half Marathon paid competitors at rates that were far lower than those recommended by AK. Instructively, it is only after the organisers of the Ndakaini Half Marathon agreed to pay athletes arrears from last year that AK gave them a licence. Similarly, the organisers of the Mombasa International Marathon, due on September 24, have indicated prize money that falls well short of the recommended threshold. It is high time AK put its foot down to enforce its own rules and regulations for the benefit of the athletes. Athletes sacrifice a great deal to put up a good show in races and must be rewarded accordingly. That is why the rules must be followed.

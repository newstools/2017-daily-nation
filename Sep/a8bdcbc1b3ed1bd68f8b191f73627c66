The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has maintained its Sh238 million claim against I&M Bank, arguing that the lender on three occasions failed to furnish it with crucial records that were important in determining the disputed tax amount. The taxman says that I&M Bank had in several meetings agreed to provide documents that would have helped the taxman determine the Sh238 million demand for unpaid corporate tax, withholding tax and VAT. I&M Bank has sued the KRA claiming that the commissioner of domestic taxes failed to rule on the lenderâ€™s objection to the demand within 60 days as required by law.

But the tax agency claims that I&M did not raise an objection, but simply wrote to the taxman seeking various inquiries, which cannot be translated to mean the lender raised a valid objection to the demand.

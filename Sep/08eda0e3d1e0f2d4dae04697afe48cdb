The federation of women lawyers (Fida) has demanded an apology from Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai following reports that he called for the rape of Governor Charity Ngilu. Fida national chairperson Josephine Mong’are condemned the MP saying the organisation will take action if the MP fails to apologise. “This is a clear demonstration of elections gender based violence emitted against women. It confirms some of the forms of intimidation that women are taken through when they come out to vie for political positions and strive to maintain public positions,” said Ms Mong’are in a press statement. She said intimidations against women in politics made it difficult for Kenya to achieve the two-third gender principle. The MP found himself at the centre of controversy after undated video circulated on social sites where he was captured calling for rape of the former Cabinet Secretary over her hard stand against President Uhuru Kenyatta. Ms Mong’re said the words uttered by the lawmaker were intended to intimidate and create fear within the female governor, women politicians and women voters. “We therefore demand an immediate apology from Hon Mbai, failure to which we shall take legal action against him. Women should not be cowed from vying, taking up and or maintaining political positions,” she said.

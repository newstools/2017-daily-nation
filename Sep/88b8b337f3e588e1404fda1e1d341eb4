The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has directed that all elected leaders sign the leadership and integrity code to commit themselves to honest public service as they take up their new roles. The essence of that is to rid the public of malfeasance. On paper, this is a critical undertaking. In practice, however, it is a fallacy. IMPROPRIETY The tenure of the past Parliament and county governments was characterised by colossal looting and plunder of public resources. It was also marked by indolence and disobedience that do not befit the offices. Yet nothing was done to them. There was no sanction or even reprimand. Cabinet secretaries, permanent secretaries, governors and parastatal chiefs were accused of financial impropriety. JUSTICE MPs were faulted for extortion, abuse of office and loss of Constituency Development Fund cash. A few were arrested and taken to court, but even those charged were not convicted. The majority got away scot-free. Worse, many ascended to higher offices. CONVICTIONNothing came out of the EACC’s threats to take action but its whining about lack of prosecutorial powers. These rituals — including public declaration of wealth — are outright dishonest and worthless. Until the EACC secures conviction for thieving and delinquent public officers and other relevant agencies act on wrongdoers, such endeavours are merely a play for the public gallery.

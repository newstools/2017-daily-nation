IN CAPE TOWNThe 2011 Frankfurt Marathon silver medallist Agnes Jepkemboi Kiprop of Kenya will be the woman to beat when 2017 Sanlam Cape Town Marathon gets underway on Sunday in this South African coastal city.Kiprop, the 2017 Ottawa Marathon bronze medallist who turned 38 on Thursday, boasts a personal best time of two hours, 23 minutes and 54 minutes which she recorded in 2011 in Frankfurt where she took silver medal.She is the fastest runner in the women s field this season, having timed 2:29:54 in China in May this year.A new winner will be crowned in the women s category following the late withdrawal of Great Britain s Tish Jones. On paper, the 38-year-old is the firm favourite for the women s title following the Jones of Great Britain. Ever so cautiously optimistic, the soft-spoken marathoner from Elgeyo Marakwet County believes victory tomorrow will be a befitting reward after months of preparations in Iten. Frankly speaking, the winner is among us (Kenyans). It s a bit windy here and we are hoping the wind can slow down to enable us have a good race, the 2102 Prague Marathon winner told a battery of journalists yesterday in Cape Town.Kiprop comes up against strong challenge from fellow Kenyan Dorris Chengeywo with a personal best time of 2:31:50 from 2016 Wien Marathon in Vienna, Austria.Kiprop, who is also the 2010 Commonwealth Games 10,000 metres silver medallist, hopes to continue her fine run over the distance as she competes in her third marathon race since competing in Singapore (2015) and Vienna (2016). The course looks good. The quality field here is a good, and the fact that the race has been given a gold label status stands well with athletes, Kiprop, who trains at Kaptagat and runs under the Pace Management stable, said.Others who will challenge the two Kenyan for the title are Ethiopia s Betehelm Moges with a personal best time of 2:24:29. Moges best time this season is 2:33:48 which she recorded in 2017 Hong Kong Marathon to take silver. Moges teams up with her compatriot, seasoned marathoner Fantu Eticha and debutant Genet Habela.Germany s Lisa Hahner, with a PB of 2:28:39, will also be in contention for the title. email print email print

Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko Mbuvi has threatened to dismiss workers who will take part in a strike demanding their August salaries. The Kenya County Government Workers Union gave the devolved unit up to Wednesday to pay the employees arrears amounting to more than 18 billion. Mr Sonko said it was wrong for the union to call a strike before conclusion of negotiations. JOBLESSThe county boss accused the union’s City branch chief Benson Olunga of not presenting the workers’ grievances to the devolved unit properly. He said Mr Olunga had resorted to threats and blackmail “instead of following the laid down procedures”. The governor said any of the 15,000 workers heeding Mr Olunga’s strike call would be rendered jobless. “Please take note that Nairobi City has more than a million jobless but qualified people who are ready to take your positions as soon as you down your tools,” Mr Sonko said. TALKSThe governor added that his administration would not work under threats, intimidation, blackmail or coercion. Mr Sonko said he held a meeting with union officials on August 30 where several issues touching on workers’ welfare were discussed. “My administration is therefore perturbed that the union is planning to call a strike even before amicable solutions to the matters raised during our meetings are addressed,” part of the statement read, urging the workers to be patient.

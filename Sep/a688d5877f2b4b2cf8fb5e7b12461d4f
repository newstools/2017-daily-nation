An editor of a popular local magazine is about to walk down the aisle in what is expected to be a fabulous and destination white wedding with an intimate guest list. The invite only wedding is supposed to take place soon, at the swanky English Point Maruna luxury beach hotel in Mombasa. A Showbuzz source has revealed that the bride to be who apparently is high maintenance will say “I Do” to her future groom in December. But, of course, being high maintenance, she is overseeing every little last detail before the nuptials. The groomsmen, for starters are required to don suits that will cost nothing less than Sh50, 000. It is however unknown which designer labels the suits will be. Secondly, a barber will be flown to Mombasa to ensure the grooms and his groomsmen get stylish haircuts.

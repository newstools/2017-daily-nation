Uganda police on Wednesday searched the headquarters of Action Aid Uganda, in Kansanga near Kampala. An employee of the global organisation that works to further human rights and defeat poverty for all, told Daily Monitor that the officers cordoned off the offices and ordered all staff not to leave. 15 OFFICERS “We are allowed to move within the compound but nobody is allowed beyond the main gate,” he said. About 15 police officers, he said, had taken positions inside the main office block and other offices. Daily Monitor has learnt that the officers searched the finance director’s office in the company of the organisation's human resources manager. A source said other officers recorded names and titles of all staff members. WARRANT Daily Monitor has seen a copy of a search warrant authorising D/AIP Henry Peter Walya to access Action Aid Uganda offices. The warrant was issued on Wednesday and signed by Juliet Nakitende, a Magistrate at Makindye Magistrates Court. The police, according to the warrant, were supposed to access computer accessories (electronics), mobile handsets, money transfer related documents and bank transaction documents. Reports indicated that the officers also searched the offices of Great Lakes Initiative for Strategic Studies.

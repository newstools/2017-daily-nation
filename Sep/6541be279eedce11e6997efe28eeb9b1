Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui has asked politicians to embrace tolerance and avoid statements that could plunge the country into chaos as the repeat presidential election nears. Governor Kinyanjui described the recent developments in the country as disturbing and insensitive and can easily spark violence. “It is unfortunate that some leaders are working hard to divide the country. I plead with all leaders from across the country and parties. Do not take us back to violence,” said Mr Kinyanjui in a statement to the press. His statement comes in the backdrop of fresh demands and street protests against the electoral commission by the opposition National Super Alliance (Nasa). GRIDLOCK “We walked that road in the past and left deep scars on our national conscience. We do not wish to go back to the 2007/2008 situation,” added the governor. Mr Kinyanjui raised concern that a section of politicians especially those allied to the opposition have ill motives and were busy driving the country into a constitutional gridlock. “Politicians should focus on selling their policies peacefully without causing any form of animosity or conflict amongst the electorate. Why can leaders drive the country into a constitutional crisis and still call that democracy?” posed Mr Kinyanjui. He advised Kenyans especially the youth not to be misled by politicians. “I urge Kenyans to embrace peace and shun leaders, who want to divide them along tribal lines,” said Mr Kinyanjui. The county boss further urged politicians to respect each other and avoid using of derogatory language.

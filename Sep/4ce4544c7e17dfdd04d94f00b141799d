The Sportpesa Premier League match pitting hosts Western Stima against Sony Sugar on Sunday has been brought forward to 11 am to pave way for the ongoing 38th edition of the Kenya Communications Sports Organisations (Kecoso) Games at Kisumu’s Moi Stadium. Newly appointed Western Stima coach Richard Makumi, formerly with Ugandan outfit Mbarara City FC, confirmed the changes in kick-off time as he gears up for his first match in charge since he was appointed on Wednesday. Mukami took over from long-serving coach Henry Omino who was shown the door following a spell of poor results. “My major agenda will be to guide the team out of the relegation zone. I have analysed the team and now what I am going to do is to ensure that we build on the weaknesses," said Makumi. “Our finishing is still shaky, and that is where I need to strengthen. The team has young players that can be nurtured and I am sure they will do well.” Stima, who have been battling the chop all season, will be looking to revenge a 2-0 loss at Awendo Green Stadium during the first leg match back in May. TOUGH TIE However, this proves to be another daunting task for Stima who have lost three of their last five against the millers. The Salim Babu-coached Sony will be are buoyed by their two crucial wins against defending champions Tusker (2-0) and 13-time champions AFC Leopards (1-0) in their last two matches. “Western Stima is not a small team. We respect them and we will approach the game cautiously," said Babu. "We understand at the moment they are aiming to post good results that will help them leave the relegation zone. This is a true revelation that we are headed for a difficult encounter.”

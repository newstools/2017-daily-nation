At least five classrooms at Tenwek High School in Bomet have been gutted by night fire. Police on Friday said there were no casualties in the Thursday night fire as all students were asleep in their dorms. CAUSE Bomet police boss Samson Rukunga said the fire, whose cause still remains unknown, started in one of the classrooms before spreading to others. The county’s two county government fire engines had technical problems and it took more two hours for the students and villagers to put out the flames.   “We have launched investigations to establish the cause of the fire,” said Mr Rukunga. Several local leaders including Kenya National Union of Teachers Secretary-General Wilson Sossion, Bomet Deputy Governor Hillary Barchok, Bomet Woman Rep Joyce Korir, Nakuru Deputy Governor Eric Korir and the county director of education Beatrice Asiako visited the institution after the incident.   They called on the government to conduct thorough investigation into the incident.

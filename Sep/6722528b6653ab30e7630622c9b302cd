The judges of the Kenyan Supreme Court have been rightly hailed for the boldness of the decision they took annulling the presidential election due to deficiencies identified with the way the electoral commission handled the August 8 vote. Although they had initially promised to issue the full judgment on September 1, in contrast to the court in 2013 which released only a summarised decision and received much criticism, the court led by Justice David Maraga also pleaded for more time. That was understandable considering the very constrained timelines in which the matter was heard and disposed off. However, while it is true the law allows the judges 21 days in which to issue a full judgment, they should give serious consideration on the need to offer the decision earlier. FRESH ELECTION The country is in a state of uncertainty ahead of a high-stakes fresh election. The judges directed strong criticism at the electoral commission in their summarised judgment. If they issued a full version soon, it would be easier for the leadership of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to know what to correct and for donors to offer the needed support to ensure the fresh election is run properly. It is never easy to write a momentous judgment on a decision with few precedents but in the interests of the country, the judges of the Supreme Court should burn the midnight oil and release the full decision of the court early.

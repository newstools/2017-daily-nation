Former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has filed a petition in court contesting the election of Prof Anyang’ Nyong’o as the governor. Mr Ranguma, accompanied by his lawyer Richard Onsongo, filed the case 10 minutes to 7pm Wednesday at the Kisumu High Court registry. The former governor is suing the Independent Electoral Commission (IEBC), Governor Nyong'o and the Kisumu County Returning Officer John Cox Lorionokou. Mr Onsongo said they filed the case at the eleventh hour because his team was looking for documents that would form the basis of their petition. Mr Ranguma’s prayers are that a declaration be made that IEBC completely mismanaged the election and that the declaration made by the returning officer was erroneous. “We want a declaration that the election of (Prof) Nyong’o was erroneous and upon scrutiny, recount and audit of votes, Jack Ranguma would be found to have been properly elected based on numbers. We also want costs,” said Mr Onsongo. GREATER DEMOCRACY Mr Ranguma said Kenya aspires to have a greater democracy and justice as well and that he was filing this to show justice was not served to the greater people of Kisumu County. He pointed out that Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga talked of computer generated leaders and that the same was the case in Kisumu. "There is one kifaranga cha computer here in Kisumu that I know of but with evidence we have filed and prayers of the people of Kisumu we are going to ensure the declaration is overturned," Mr Ranguma. Earlier, Mrs Grace Akumu of Citizens Conventions Party had filed a petition contesting the win of Kisumu Woman Representative Rozah Buyu. Other cases filed in Kisumu Court include those challenging wins in ward representative seats for Kolwa East Ward filed by Mr Osumba Olum, Masogo Nyang'oma Ward filed by Samwel Ong'ow and West Kisumu Ward filed By Joseph Otiende Abiola. All the petitioners are former MCAs.  The cases were filed at the Chief Magistrate’s Court.

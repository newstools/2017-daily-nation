Kenyan sportsmen and women continue to notch global triumphs that affirm our position as a sporting nation. However, unlike other global stars, most of our top performers have hardly anything to show for their stellar careers after failing to cash in on their success to attract commercial endorsements. Many global stars such as Usain Bolt (athletics), Serena Williams (tennis), Michael Phelps (swimming), Rafael Nadal (tennis) and Kevin Durant (basketball) continue to market themselves, earning more off the tracks and courts in multi-million-dollar endorsements. Last year, for instance, Durant earned Sh3.6 billion, Nadal Sh3.2 billion, Bolt Sh3 billion, Williams Sh2 billion and Phelps Sh1.2 billion in endorsements and other commercial deals. ELIUD KIPCHOGE Kenya’s Olympic marathon champion Eliud Kipchoge’s Sh15 million deal, signed last week with a local motor vehicle firm to be their brand ambassador, is the way to go. It should encourage other top Kenyan performers in sports not to sell themselves short. Lack of knowledge and marketing skills has been the undoing of most of our athletes, with their managers doing little to help them to maximise their potential. Kipchoge’s challenge to his fellow sportsmen and women and local corporate bodies to engage for mutual benefit is, therefore, timely and healthy.

Work at Ruring’u stadium has stalled following a dispute between Kenya Power and the contractor over a power line that has cut through the facility just two months after the project was launched by the President. The dispute emerged after Kenya Power told the contractor to pay Sh1.4 million before it can relocate the power line, something that the contractor says was not factored in the initial quotation. The contractor, Sam Mwaniki, wondered how the way leave for a major power line could have been allowed through a property that was meant for sports and other activities in the first place. “We are supposed to move with speed since our deadline for the first phase is June. We are supposed to be doing heavy excavation by now but we can’t because of the powerline,” Mwaniki said on Wednesday. He disclosed that Sports Kenya who are the project’s owners are in talks with Kenya Power to resolve the stalemate. COST OF PROJECT The Sh450 million project meant to upgrade the facility to international standards was launched in June by President Uhuru Kenyatta, with the first phase expected to be completed by June next year. The first phase is budgeted to cost Sh250 milllion and covers a stadium with IAAF-standard athletics track and a spectator gallery, a swimming pool, a warm-up track, among other facilities. The launch of the project by President Kenyatta marked the end of decade-long ownership row between former owners of the parcel of land on which the project is being built. During the launch, the President handed over Ruring’u Stadium tittle deed to Nyeri County government.

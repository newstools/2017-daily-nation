Police in Kilifi County are investigating the murder of a Swiss national whose body was found dumped at Mtwapa creek. The body of the man identified as Moser Max was found by a fisherman on Thursday with serious injuries on the face. The elderly man had been in Kenya for sometime. ROBBERY Coast Regional Police Commandant Larry Kieng said the deceased appeared to have been hit by a sharp object; but was not robbed. "The guy likes going fishing where he was killed. His fishing gear and other personal items including his phone were found intact. "Thus, we are still investigating to establish the motive of his murder," Mr Kieng said. TARGETED His killing comes three weeks after the bodies of a Swiss couple were found dumped by a roadside in Nguu Tatu in Kisauni, Mombasa. The necks and backs of the two had deep cuts. Mr Kieng said police are now on alert following the incidents, which suggest that elderly foreigners are being targeted. "We are going to get those who killed Max just like the way we got those who were behind the couple's murder. "Let those criminals perpetuating the crimes know that they can hide but cannot run. I want to assure both the foreigners and locals of their security," he said.   Police say man suspected to have committed suicide on the beach.

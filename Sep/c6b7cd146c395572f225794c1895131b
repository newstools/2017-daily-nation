The National Super Alliance on Sunday endorsed Nation Media Group products for standing for truthful journalism. Siaya Senator James Orengo told Nasa supporters to tune in to NTV and read the Daily Nation newspaper. The senator, who was addressing a rally in Kitengela Town, Kajiado County said NTV and the Nation are reporting the truth. “Earlier on, I asked you to stop consuming Nation Media Group products but they are now reporting events well. Now you can read the Nation and watch NTV,” he told the crowd. ACCUSED OF BIAS After the bungled August 8 presidential election, the media company came under attack from opposition leaders who accused it of bias. Mr Orengo said the widely read newspaper and the TV station were deliberately ignoring truth from the opposition side. He made the remarks during a rally at Kamukunji Grounds in Kibra Constituency, Nairobi County. Ironically, it was only NTV that streamed the rally and Senator Orengo’s remarks live. The senator spoke in the presence of Nasa leader Raila Odinga and several other lawmakers. WIDELY CRITICISED His remarks were widely criticised and seen as an affront on the freedom of the media. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru termed the statement unfortunate, uncalled for and irresponsible. Muslim leaders and a journalists lobby also defended the media over accusations of bias. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya organising secretary Sheikh Mohammed Khalifa said it was wrong for politicians and other leaders to direct their anger at media houses. Sunday’s rally was attended by former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama and a host of opposition politicians.

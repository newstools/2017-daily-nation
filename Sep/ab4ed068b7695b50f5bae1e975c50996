Football Kenya Federation’s vice president, Doris Petra has challenged corporates to support women in sports. Petra has also asked the media to offer better coverage of female sports teams so as to encourage increased interest in women’s sports activities and teams. Speaking in Nairobi on Monday during the inaugural Women, Sport and Development Symposium organised by Interdisciplinary Centre for Gender Studies (ICFG) of the University of Bern (Switzerland) in partnership with Football Kenya Federation, Petra also asked sports stakeholders in the forum, among them Nairobi Women’s Representative Esther Passaris, to adopt women’s teams. “Women in this industry have been on a painful journey and many times that journey has ended prematurely. I urge companies, the media and the government officials to make deliberate measures to uplift and appreciate women and girls who play. The symposium was a platform for sports stakeholders to share ideas, highlight the challenges affecting female sports persons and to come up with practical solutions aimed at promoting equity and equality in women’s sports. “Such discussions offer stakeholders chance to share ideas and possible solutions to barriers that women sports persons encounter in their careers,” she said.

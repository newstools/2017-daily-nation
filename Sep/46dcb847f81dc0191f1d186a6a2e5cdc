Returning striker Neddy Atieno struck four times as Harambee Starlets humiliated Mauritius 11-0 in a lop-sided Cosafa Women's Championship match at the 10,000-seater Luveve Stadium in Bulawayo. Atieno scored four goals in that match, while striker Mwanahalima Adam and Lucy Mukhwana scored a brace each. Dorcas Shikobe and Cherise Avilia weighed in with a goal each to complete the score that now guarantees them a position in the tournament’s next stage. Madleine Rassoie slid in an own goal in the second minute of added time to bring matters to a close. Atieno is now the tournament’s top scorer alongside Malawian international Tabitha Chawinga who also has seven goals to her name. Adam opened the floodgates in the ninth minute, before Atieno doubled the lead 11 minutes later. The former national team captain doubled her tally just eight minutes later with a powerful right footed shot, adding another goal with a header in the 30th minute. Mauritius had only three goal attempts throughout the match, and were forced into many defensive errors by the dominant Kenyan side. Shikobe, Mukhwana and Achieng had their day out in the sun in the second half before Madleine Rassoie slid in an own goal in the second minute of added time to bring matters to a close. Kenya now tops the Group B with six points and 15 goals, while Mauritius, who lost 3-0 to Swaziland in the opening match remain rooted at the bottom of the group. Starlets’ next group match will be against Swaziland on Monday.   Kenya beat Mozambique 5-2 in their Cosafa Group B opener.

A man arrested in Nairobi's suburb Eastleigh for being in possession of a cat carcass was on Friday arraigned in court. Richard Muriithi Karuai was arrested on Thursday in Kijiji, which is on Major Muriithi Road, on suspicion that he was using cat meat in making samosas. Appearing before chief magistrate Roselyn Oganyo, Mr Muriithi denied the charges. He said he collects garbage on the road but on the fateful day he was caught clearing the carcass, which was beginning to rot. “I collected the dead cat from the road to save the residents from the stench. I was not going to sell the meat. I just skinned it and did not have a buyer with me when I was arrested,” Mr Muriithi said. Asked by the court why he took the trouble to skin the carcass, he said that he was not planning to sell its meat but just wanted its skin to sell later. The magistrate released him on a cash bail of Sh2,000. The case will be mentioned on October 3 and the hearing on the October 22 . Ms Oganyo also directed the family to take him for a mental checkup before the hearing date.

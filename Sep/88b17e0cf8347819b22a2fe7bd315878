A lecturer at the University of Nairobi is facing prosecution for asking for a Sh3,100 bribe to allow a student to resit an examination. Director of Public Prosecutions  Keriako Tobiko said he had accepted the recommendation of the Ethics and anti-Corruption Commission to prosecute the lecturer based at Upper Kabete Campus. “The commission commenced investigations upon receipt of allegations that a lecturer at the University of Nairobi had requested a financial advantage as a condition to allow the complainant to resit an examination,” said Mr Tobiko. In his report covering April to June this year, the DPP said the investigations established that the lecturer solicited and received a financial advantage of Sh3,100 from the student. LECTURER ARRESTED The lecturer was arrested upon receiving the money from the student. “A report was compiled and forwarded to the DPP  in May recommending that the lecturer be charged with the offences of requesting and receiving a bribe contrary to section 6 (1) (a) of the Bribery Act (No. 47 of 2016). The details are contained in a Kenya Gazette published on Friday. RECALL DEGREES The development comes in the wake of an investigation by Makerere University, which announced that it would recall some degrees awarded since 2011. A total of 88 members of staff at the institution are also under investigation for altering of marks of students. The Council of Legal Education has  since directed law graduates from Makerere University set to sit for their November bar examinations to have their documents certified by the institution. This is to enable their admission to the Kenya School of law. CLE chief executive W Kulundu-Bitonye said the students have until September 29 to submit certified documents.

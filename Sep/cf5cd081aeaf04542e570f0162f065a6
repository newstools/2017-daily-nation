The Ministry of Education has asked the electoral commission to conduct a repeat presidential election by October 17 to avoid interrupting the national examinations timetable. According to Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i, Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam candidates will start sitting some of their practical subjects as from October 23. Dr Matiang’i said preparations, including the setting, printing and packaging of examination papers for both the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and KCSE have been finalised. “We hope the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) will consider our reasonable and humble request,” said Dr Matiang'i. His sentiments were echoed by Kenya National Examination Council Chairman George Magoha who said all children have a right and postponing the national examination will not be appropriate. "There is a child in every home including in the home of IEBC officers. We should not forget the children in this equation so the players should [be considerate]," he said. As per the timetables already sent out to schools, KCPE exams will begin on October 31 and end on November 2 while KCSE exams will start on November 6 and end on 29. A total of 1,003,556 candidates will sit for KCPE exams while 615,773 will sit for KCSE exams.

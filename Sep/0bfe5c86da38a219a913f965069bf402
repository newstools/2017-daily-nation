The Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko has asked the Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu lobby to wait for the detailed judgment of the Supreme Court before he can initiate investigations against officers of the electoral body. Mr Tobiko was responding to the lobby’s petition that he investigate and prosecute certain officers of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) for the illegalities and irregularities noted by the Supreme Court in the summarised determination of the August 8 presidential election petition. SUPREME COURT “In order for me to give clear, precise and specific directives to the Inspector General of Police or any such other criminal investigative agencies as may be appropriate, and so as to facilitate a holistic and comprehensive investigation I am of the considered view that it would be proper to await delivery of the detailed and reasoned judgment of the Supreme Court. He said the judges of the highest court in Kenya had indicated that the detailed ruling will contain the particulars and substance of the irregularities and illegalities found to have been committed by IEBC. As it is, Mr Tobiko said the summarised ruling does not give specifics of the alleged criminal offences thus making it difficult for his office to act on the petition. The National Super Alliance (Nasa) and civil society groups have been calling on the IEBC to sack officers, who allegedly bungled the presidential elections in favour of Jubilee Party’s President Uhuru Kenyatta. The officers, who Nasa and the civil societies want action taken against are commissioner Abdi Guliye, who chairs the IEBC ICT committee, chief executive Ezra Chiloba, Deputy CEOs Betty Nyabuto and Marjan Hussein Marjan, directors Praxedes Tororey, Immaculate Kassait and James Muhati, and manager Moses Kipkogey.

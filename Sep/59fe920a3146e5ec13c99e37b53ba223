Hundreds of Jubilee supporters have held demonstrations outside the Supreme Court accusing the country's top court of "stealing their victory". The supporters also held demonstrations in Nakuru, Kikuyu, Nyeri and Eldoret towns. Waving placards, the demonstrators, mostly youth accused the judges of rendering an illegal judgment. They said the court should have ordered for a recount of the votes following a petition filed by the Nasa coalition after President Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner of the August 8 election. In Nakuru, protestors barricaded the Nakuru-Nairobi highway, paralysing transport. Led by Governor Lee Kinyanjui and Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria, the protestors said they will continue with the protests until President Kenyatta is sworn in.   Mr Gikaria singled out Deputy Chief Justice Mwilu and Justice Lenaona whom he claimed favoured the opposition in the ruling that nullified the August 8 presidential elections. Protestors in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County threatened to hold protests daily if Justice Mwilu and Justice Lenaola are not sent packing by the Judicial Service Commission.   Jubilee supporters in Nyeri town demanded the Supreme Court to order recount of votes of the presidential elections. The demo was held as Kenyans await the full judgment of the court. It also comes amid petitions filed at the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) seeking the removal of judges Philomena Mwilu (Deputy Chief Justice) and Isaac Lenaola.   JSC members were also meeting at the Supreme Court amid the petitions. The demonstrators had earlier converged at Uhuru Park. They were shouting “Maraga must go” and “Uhuru mpaka 2022”.   The configuration would take at least 30 days from the start date, which has not begun.

A Nakuru court has declared Assumption Sisters of Nairobi the legal owners of the multibillion St Mary’s Mission Hospital. The ownership dispute between Catholic nuns and an American missionary has been in court for more than six years and came to an end after the Environment and Lands Court declared the sisters the rightful owners of the hospitals. OWNERSHIP Justice Sila Munyao handed over the hospitals located in Nairobi and Nakuru to the nuns. The sisters and the American missionary, Dr William Charles Fryda, had laid claim to the property.

"The court therefore orders that the hospital’s property be transferred to the Assumption Sisters of Nairobi,” the judge said. Dr Fryda, a trained oncologist (cancer specialist), filed the case in 2011 seeking to eject the nuns from the hospital premises for allegedly interfering with the running of the facilities. LANDThe priest claimed to be the founder and chief executive officer of the institutions and accused the nuns of trying to kick him out and take over the property. Through his lawyer, Dr Fryda argued that he used his money and that from his donors to buy the parcels of land in Nakuru and Nairobi on which the hospitals sit.

The EuroMillions lottery jackpot grew to €163 million (Sh20 billion) after rolling over and has some predicting that the jackpot will reach its €190 million (Sh23 billion) cap.  The current jackpot started at an especially high €130 million (Sh15.9 billion) as part of the special EuroMillions Superdraw, a special lottery event that takes place only once or twice a year. Since the first draw on 15th September, the jackpot has rolled over three times. If the jackpot reaches its €190 million (Sh23 billion) cap the money that would normally go to the jackpot will trickle down to secondary prizes. The jackpot may remain at its capped amount for four draws. If there are no jackpot winners on the fourth draw, the jackpot will be distributed among the winners of the next highest prize category. Ticket sales at online retailer theLotter have already taken off as international players rush to purchase their entries to this incredible jackpot. Services such as theLotter are also available in Kenya, where it is not economically feasible to travel to Europe to purchase lottery tickets. TheLotter uses local agents in Austria, France, Spain, and the UK to buy official lottery tickets on behalf of customers from all over the world.

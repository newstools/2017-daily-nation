Mombasa Olympic Ladies FC capitalised on their home advantage with an emphatic 6-0 victory over visiting Soccer Sisters at Mbaraki Sports Club in Mombasa on Saturday. Harambee Starlets’s lethal striker Mwanahalima Adam scored a hat-trick with Elizabeth Katungwa netting a brace as one-time Starlets trialist Nuru Mustafa got another. Olympic head coach Joseph Oyoo said they trained for only three days before the match and praised his players for playing according to instructions. “My girls played well and we deserved to win by even a bigger margin,” said Oyoo. However, Oyoo called upon well-wishers to come forward and help the team honour their four away matches. “We don’t want to miss these matches because we’ll be demoted to the national super league next season. We’ve a good team to finish the league on a respectable position,” he said. Soccer Sisters team manager Margaret Otando said her players arrived few hours before the game. "It was not our day. Our opponents looked the better side and deserved the win,” she said. After a host of missed chances, Adam gave the hosts the lead in the 16th minute with a powerful shot before adding a second in the 22nd minute. Katungwa nodded the ball home for Olympic's third goal in the 33rd minute and Adam grabbed her hat-trick and her team’s fourth goal in the 36th minute. Soccer Sisters got two golden chances but Zainab Hamisi and Margaret Wanjiru were brilliantly denied by Olympic goalkeeper, Regina Shehe. In the second half, Olympic went into offensive and were rewarded with two more goals through Katungwa na Mustafa in the 60th and 77th minutes respectively. Another premier league match involving Spedag Ladies and Nairobi’s Soccer Queens failed to kick off at Mombasa Sports Club on Saturday after the home team failed to turn up.

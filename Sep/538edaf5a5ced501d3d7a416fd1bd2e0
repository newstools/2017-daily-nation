Officers from the Anti-Terror Police Unit (ATPU) in Isiolo are interrogating a suspected Al-Shabaab member who was arrested in Olabule estate in Isiolo Town. According to the police, Shadrack Munene Kabaara alias Hassan Munene is suspected to be a recruiting agent for Al-Shabaab and monitors those arrested on their way to join the terrorist group in Somalia. Isiolo County Criminal Investigation Officer (CCIO) Raphael Barasa said an Isiolo court have granted investigating officers until Monday next week to complete investigations. “We suspect that he (Kabaara) has links with Al-Shabaab in Somalia or he was planning to cross the border to join the terror group,” said Mr Barasa. He added that on those suspicions, Anti-Terrorism Police officers arrested the suspect who was booked at Isiolo police station on weekend.

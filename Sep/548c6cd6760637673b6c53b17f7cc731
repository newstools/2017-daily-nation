Strathmore Blades recovered to defeat Zetech University 55-49 in their hotly-contested men’s Kenya Basketball Federation Premier League second leg match at Strathmore University on Sunday. After losing 36-57 to Ulinzi Warriors at the same venue on Saturday, coach Tony Ochieng of Blades rested five of his players, and they delivered two hard-fought points. Blades’ stars Shilton Ochieng and Brian Onyango scored quick points as they led 9-6 at the end of the first quarter. Zetech, who are in danger of relegation on their first attempt in the tough Premier League, had Chris Oluk and Regan Brian threatening Blades’ defence. Zetech were up 19-14 at the breather, having led 13-5 in the second quarter. It became anybody’s game when the two battling team locked the scores 41-41 in regulation time forcing referees Juma Kent and David Maina to call for five-minute overtime to separate the scores. Blades, who had Brian Onyango ejected, raced a 14-8 run in overtime to celebrate victory. Coach Tonny Ochieng said: “It was a tough game against a team which has nothing to lose because they are facing relegation. We had played poorly against Ulinzi Warriors and victory has pushed us to the second position,’’ Zetech coach Job Munene said.

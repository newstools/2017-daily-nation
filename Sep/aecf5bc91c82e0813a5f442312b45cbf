WASHINGTON, Al-Qaeda is on the rise again in the shadow of the Islamic State group in Syria, 16 years after the jihadists shocked the United States in the September 11, 2001 attacks, experts said Monday.They said that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Sunni group that last month seized control of the northern Syrian city of Idlib, is simply a "rebranding" of Al-Qaeda that is positioning itself as more moderate than the Islamic State in hopes of a resurgence.AFFILIATE"ISIS may be today's preeminent terrorist threat, but Al-Qaeda in Syria is worrisome. It is Al-Qaeda's largest global affiliate at this point," said former White House counterterrorism director Joshua Geltzer.Speaking on the current terror threat against the United States at the New America think tank, Geltzer and other experts said they expect HTS to take centre stage among jihadists as the Islamic State group loses ground on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq.HTS is simply a cosmetic name-change for Al-Qaeda, they said.

SUPPORTHe called Al-Qaeda a "much stronger" organisation than in 2010, when its weakness gave way to the rise of Islamic State."It has skilfully played itself off of ISIS to portray its organisation as being the 'moderate jihadists', people who you might not like but you can do business with."A New York City Police Department officer breaks down while visiting the North pool during a commemoration ceremony for the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks at the National September 11 Memorial, September 11, 2017 in New York City.

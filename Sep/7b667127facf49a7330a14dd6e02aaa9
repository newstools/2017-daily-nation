SOWETO South Africa may appeal a Fifa decision ordering the replay of a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Senegal after the referee manipulated the result. "The South African Football Association (Safa) is studying the contents of the report and will issue a statement on intentions to challenge that decision," the organisation said Thursday. Fifa said the match, won 2-1 by South Africa, must be replayed after international sport judicial body CAS rejected an appeal by Ghanaian referee Joseph Lamptey against a life ban. South Africa scored off a penalty awarded by Lamptey for a handball that never occurred, and their second goal stemmed from a free-kick taken before the whistle was blown. "Safa wishes to state categorically that it was in no way involved with any wrongdoing related to the actions of the referee, as stated in the Fifa report," the association statement added. The replay must take place during the November 6-14 international window, when the teams also meet in Dakar. Being told to replay the match completed a disastrous six days for South Africa after shock home and away qualifying losses to lowly Cape Verde. Stripped of the three points won against Senegal, it leaves Bafana Bafana with just one, five less than co-leaders Burkina Faso and Cape Verde. Only the five Africa zone group winners qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.   The diminutive 30-year-old cuts an increasingly isolated figure on the pitch.

THE HAGUE Netherlands coach Dick Advocaat on Friday dropped Wesley Sneijder for their crucial 2018 World Cup qualifiers next month and gave winger Ryan Babel a surprise recall. Advocaat's 24-man squad take on Belarus on October 7, before hosting Sweden in what looks set to be a crunch match in their final qualifier on October 10. The Netherlands are hoping to avoid failing to qualify for successive major tournaments for the first time since 1986 after missing out on Euro 2016, but are third in European qualifying Group A, three points behind second-placed Sweden and four behind leaders France. Only the top nation will gain an automatic spot for the finals in Russia, with second place likely to yield a play-off. The 33-year-old Sneijder has made a record 132 appearances for the Dutch national team, but has struggled to break into the Nice first team since joining in the close season and has not played for the Ligue 1 side since August. Advocaat has given Besiktas winger Babel, 30, his first call-up in six years, after the former Liverpool man's impressive start to the season in Turkey. But he will have to make do without Stoke City defender Bruno Martins Indi and Lazio full-back Stefan de Vrij, who are both injured.

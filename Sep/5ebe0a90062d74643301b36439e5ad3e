National Super Alliance (Nasa) leader Raila Odinga takes his campaigns to Kisii and Nyamira Counties in what promises to be a serious battle for votes. The Tuesday tour is a re-renewed campaign by the Nasa principals after Supreme Court annulled the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. ODM Kisii County coordinating committee chairman Samwel Omwando and secretary Amos Andama said the Nasa principals will land in Nyamira Town at 10am and address a roadside rally. Mr Odinga will be accompanied by his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka and co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula. “Raila will later address residents in stop-overs at Keroka, Birongo, Keumbu, Kisii Town, Nyakoe, Mosocho, Eroga before proceeding to Oyugis in Homa Bay County,” said Mr Omwando. Mr Omwando said the Nasa leader’s visit is meant to consolidate support in the region ahead of the October 17 presidential elections.  Mr Omwando said Mr Odinga and his team will use the opportunity to thank residents for voting for him in the August 8 poll and seek their support in the upcoming election. Governors James Ongwae (Kisii) and John Nyagarama (Nyamira) will lead local leaders in welcoming the Nasa team to the region. “I urge residents to turn up in large numbers in solidarity with the Nasa team,” said Omwando.  Former Kitutu Masaba MP Timothy Bosire said the visit will be proof that Gusiiland is an opposition strong hold. “The votes that Jubilee claim to have got from Kisii and Nyamira is a pure lie and we shall prove it in the repeat poll,” he said. In Nyamira County, in the nullified poll, President Kenyatta got 106,729 votes (52 percent) against Mr Odinga’s 95,201 votes (46 percent).

Jubilee leaders have dismissed Nasaâ€™s rejection of the October 17 date set by the electoral commission for the repeat presidential poll. They have termed the conditions given by Nasa before participating in the elections as tactics of a losing candidate. Through Senate Majority Leader Kipchumba Murkomen, who is also the Elgeyo-Marakwet senator, Jubilee leaders said it is not a must for Nasa to participate in the election. Speaking Tuesday at Parliament, Mr Murkomen said the opposition should respect the rule of law and independent institutions. "IEBC is an independent commission and should not be directed on how to do its work," Mr Murkomen said. Mr Murkomen said there is no legal requirement for the opposition to be on the ballot hence they should not give conditions "Let them boycott and Uhuru Kenyatta will be sworn in as the next president. It Wil be an easy job for us," Mr Murkomen said. He said as Jubilee, they are ready for the election at any time.   Raila Odinga's team wants Ezra Chiloba and other IEBC chiefs removed from the commission.

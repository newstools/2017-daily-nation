Considering that maize and its by-products are Kenya’s staple foods, the Ministry of Agriculture should have invested in an early warning system to trigger an alarm whenever the supply of the commodities reduce to the point of risking mass hunger. Because that has not been done, Kenya finds itself facing a precarious supply of maize and related food products. This is not an enviable position for the country to find itself in, especially in politically volatile times. As experience has demonstrated, a political crisis can easily disrupt the food supply chain with the urban poor ultimately being the most vulnerable. ATRIFICIAL DEFICITS This can create real or artificial deficits in the supply of staple foods such as maize and maize flour, a mix that has the potential to trigger unrest, especially among the urban poor. Yet this is a situation that can be averted by investing in a system that warns the relevant institutions of a considerable shortfall — as has been reported about maize in Rift Valley, considered Kenya’s grain basket. It is not too late, however. The government should take early measures to motivate all farmers, including small-holders, to sell their surplus to the National Cereals and Produce Board as one way of ensuring that there is enough maize in the strategic reserve. Going forward, long-term solutions need to be adopted to end the country’s perennial vulnerability to hunger.

Hi! I need your advice. I was with this woman for six years. We broke up a few months ago and I’m not over her. I regret the fact that I did not commit to her. I love her but it is holding me back. I do not know what to do. Please help me. First, remember that no relationship is a waste, even the worst one. This is as long as you keep your eyes and ears open for the lessons it taught you. Second, it takes more than just a couple of months to get completely over a person you were with for six years. Stop being so hard on yourself. You’ll get to the other side eventually. What you can do is stop obsessing about it. Stop looking at what might have been and instead look at what the future could hold for you. Find activities or projects that you enjoy and which improve you as a man to fill your time.  Do you have feedback on this story? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com

Should I stay or should I just use her and leave her?

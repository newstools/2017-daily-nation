Orange Democratic Movement MPs have slammed National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale for criticising the Nasa campaign fundraising. Mr Samuel Atandi (Alego Usonga) and Onyango K'Oyoo (Muhoroni) said Mr Duale should not attack the National Super Alliance leaders because they are not doing anything illegal. Nasa presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka launched a paybill number (991444) through which their supporters can contribute financially to their cause. FRAUD Mr Atandi said Nasa’s quest for campaign funds was not strange "as it is a common practice in mature democracies". "In fact, the overwhelming grassroots support [Barrack] Obama received in both his presidential bids in 2008 and 2012 were partly because of ..donor funding by American citizens who believed he represented their values and interests," he said at Acacia Premier Hotel in Kisumu on Saturday. On Friday, Mr Duale accused Nasa of planning to defraud Kenyans. "Kenyans must ignore these fraudsters masquerading as liberators. We are asking Kenyans to be very careful because this is similar to gambling [...] he said. JUBILEE Speaking separately, Mr K'Oyoo told the Garissa Town MP to focus on Jubilee Party matters. "What is Duale’s concern? He seems to be too idle. I wonder why he gets so preoccupied with Nasa affairs. "He should stick to Jubilee issues and leave Nasa alone," Mr K'Oyoo said.   Odinga said the Nasa initiative is people-driven.

Former Rotterdam Marathon champion Philes Ongori made a winning return from her maternity break by clinching the Eighth Safaricom Kisii Half Marathon title in one hour, 16 minutes and six seconds on Friday. The mother of twins — who won the Dutch port city marathon on her debut in 2011 — beat another local favourite Joy Kemuma (1:16:08) to second place in the race that started and concluded at the Gusii Stadium. Teresiah Omosa was third in 1:17:12. In the men’s race, Joseph Koech of Keroka Athletics Club beat Edwin Mokua to the top podium place, his winning time being 1:04:39 with Mokua following closely in 1:05:18. Kipyegon Letich of Keringet came third in 1:05:25. Ongori’s victory brought her back into the limelight after a two-year maternity break. “I have been on maternity leave and I kept off the field to ensure my twins got maximum care,” said the 31-year-old runner. The mother of Queen Blessing and Princess Joseph, who spent a number of years in Japan, dedicated her victory to the twins. “The hilly and level sections of the pathway were sort of challenging. The weather was also too clumsy, but all in all, I won.” She used the race to test herself ahead of the Saitama International Women’s Marathon to be held in Japan on November 12.  Koech, aged 21, went home with Sh100,000 winning prize while Mokua was given Sh50,000 for finishing second and Sh15,000 as the first local runner to cross the finishing line.  “I pride in my win,” Koech said, adding that he is now focusing on the Athletics Kenya weekend meetings which start in November. Over 1,000 Kisii residents also benefited from a free medical camp organised by Safaricom and the Diabetes Management Institute on the sidelines of the half marathon. RESULTSMen: 1.

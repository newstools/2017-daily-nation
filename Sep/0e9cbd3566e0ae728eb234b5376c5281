Insecurity is rearing its ugly head at the Coast again with this weekâ€™s beheading of four Kenyans in Lamu West, putting the work of the police back in the public debate agenda. The latest attack has once again put the general area of Lamu in the spotlight, coming just weeks after Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa said security agencies were launching a sustained campaign to weed out terrorists from the nearby Boni Forest. The attack has changed the security dynamics in the area after wananchi blockaded a road to protest against rising insecurity. Their anger was a symptom of a deeper underlying problem as four other people were killed in Lamu West about a fortnight ago. THWART ATTACKS As such, security agencies should enhance surveillance to thwart further attacks and guarantee security to all, especially as the country prepares for a fresh presidential election next month. Criminal elements of whatever persuasion must not be allowed to spread fear among wananchi. Security agencies must, therefore, be seen to be acting decisively against such criminal acts. Kenya is already facing political risks as a result of the heated dispute over the annulled presidential poll. The country cannot, therefore, be seen to be failing to act decisively against criminal gangs and terrorist groups. That is why it is important for security agencies to step up their vigilance and keep all parts of the country safe.

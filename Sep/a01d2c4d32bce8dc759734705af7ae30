Nominated MP Wilson Sossion has lashed out at former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto for ditching the opposition for Jubilee Party.Mr Sossion criticised the former Nasa co-principal even as some leaders of his Chama cha Mashinani party claimed Mr Ruto refused heed their calls to support Jubilee before the last August elections.'TOO LATE'His belated decision, the party leaders said, is a little too late to salvage his political career in the next five years.Yet others commended him for summoning courage to return to the Jubilee, a party he quit after a falling out with Deputy President William Ruto.Speaking in Bomet on Sunday, the Kenya National Union of Teachers secretary-general boss said Mr Ruto had lost respect among his Kipsigis community, especially after he had criticised the Jubilee of stifling devolution. He has let down the elders who recently anointed him as the Kalenjin spokesman, said Mr Sossion referring to a ceremony where the former Bomet leader was made spokesman for Kipsigis and endorsed to be in Nasa. DEVOLUTION Why did he form Chama Cha Mashinani whose policy was to pressurise the national government to release more funds to the grassroots for development projects? Mr Ruto announced last Friday in Kericho that he had quit Nasa for Jubilee and would support President Uhuru Kenyatta s re-election campaigns.However, Mr Sossion said Mr Ruto s decision would not make him change his stand on supporting the Nasa movement. I will always remain in the opposition even if I was advised to abandon it for individuals selfish gains, Mr Sossion said.NANOK But on his part, Jubilee nominated MP David Sankok said the decision by Mr Ruto was a wise one for the sake of unity in the Rift Valley.Mr Sankok said he was among leaders in the region who brokered the deal that saw the former governor ditch Nasa and join Jubilee. I m happy that Mr Ruto is now in Jubilee, my next move is to reach the Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok to also urge him to join the Jubilee administration instead of being in the opposition for the sake of faster and meaningful development for his people, he said.CCM Bomet leaders Loice Rotich and Rosaline Chepkemoi said they were happy for Mr Ruto. email print email print

Former 800 metres world champion Janeth Jepkosgei has called for more corporate companies to support talented but needy athletes. Jepkosgei said she and other elite runners have been helping many talented youngsters secure their education and now need the support of corporates. She spoke after a two-kilometre morning run organised by Barclays Bank directors and staff in Eldoret Friday, led by managing director Jeremy Awori. Awori said that they are looking into ways of partnering with athletes as they have done in other sports like the golf.  “We are going to discuss on how we are going to partner with athletics because the athletes have always done us proud,” said Awori ahead of the bank’s Eldoret golf day on Saturday.

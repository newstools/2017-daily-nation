Harambee Starlets on Thursday bowed out of the Cosafa Women's Championship after an embarrassing 4-0 loss to defending champions and hosts Zimbabwe in the semi-finals at the Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo. Goals from Rutendo Makero, Berita Kabwe, Marjory Nyaumwe and Priviledge Mupeti saw the champions put Kenya to the sword and book their place in Sunday’s final where they will come up against three-time winners South Africa. The match will be a repeat of the 2011 final which Zimbabwe won 1-0 to lift their maiden title. Kenya will take on Zambia, who lost 5-3 to South Africa on post-match penalties in the other semi, in Saturday’s third-place play-off. Kenya coach Richard Kanyi admitted that his charges suffered a ‘psychological problem’ but was pleased that they made the last four. “We came here as a guest team and to reach the last four is a good achievement. We were not good enough today and I attribute that to our mental state,” Kanyi said in his post-match comments. His opposite number Sithethelelwe Sibanda is looking forward to Sunday’s final and called on her charges to complete the job. “Kenya have given a good account of themselves in this competition and they have a good squad for the future,” she noted. Starlets, who topped Pool B with a 100 percent record, were undone by defensive errors as the hosts fully capitalised to take a 2-0 lead at the break before completing the rout in the second half to seal their place in Sunday’s final in front of their home fans.

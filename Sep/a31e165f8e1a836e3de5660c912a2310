I came across something interesting on Twitter recently. It was a video shared by one of the millions of Twitter users but the content didn't interest nearly as much as how the video was shared. The user appears to have embedded someone else's video in the tweet, much like the way you click 'retweet' then 'quote retweet' to have the tweet embedded in your tweet. Here's where it gets interesting: instead of including the caption of the quoted users’ video, it only includes the video with the original user's name above it when expanded, therein making it look like you tweeted the video yourself. Still following? NO COPYRIGHT WORRIES This feature actually enables users to share videos without worrying about crediting the source bringing forth an aspect of acknowledgement to the original author. Having noticed this advantage, I wanted to try it out but it wasn't that easy as I came to find out. Here’s what you want to do if you are running the iPhone operating system (IOS): Find the video you want to share on Twitter & long press it then click on 'Tweet video' and add your caption before the link that appears. While that may be straightforward for IOS users, the case is not the same for Android users. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how this can be done on Android with no luck. What you can opt for if you don't run IOS is by logging into your twitter account using the desktop version of Twitter and following the steps listed below; Add your caption before the link and hit Tweet!  With the number of Android users exceeding that of IOS users, it's puzzling why Twitter would choose not to include this feature across all the operating systems. Or is it a case of exclusivity?

The National Executive Council (NEC), which comprises 31 chapter secretaries directed Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) Secretary-General Constantine Wasonga to issue a 21-day strike notice starting on Monday. “I have received the unanimous approval of NEC to give the government a strike notice and I will do so on Monday,” Dr Wasonga said.

The past two strikes took more than 55 days. Universities re-opened last Monday after a month break for elections and repeat polls set for October 17 will also disrupt learning. SALARYThe more than 9,000 lecturers are protesting the delay in implementation of the new salary scale by the government, which paid them Sh10 billion arrears. “I have never seen this happen that you pay a worker an improved salary for one month then you revert back to the old salaries,” Dr Wasonga said.

A sombre mood, whispered conversations and faces that tell a story of pain, confusion and unanswered questions greet you as you enter Moi Girls School, Nairobi. After the fire incident on Saturday night that claimed the lives of nine students and left 51 others injured, Form One students and their parents were invited for a counselling session Monday. The parents feel that the sessions will help their daughters, who were overwhelmed by grief. “My daughter has not eaten anything since Saturday morning after receiving the news of the deaths of her classmates,” said one of the parents. According to Ms Jane Njeri, her niece, also a Form One student in the school, has been having sleepless nights since Saturday. Although the students were glad to see their classmates after Saturday’s misfortune, most are, however, apprehensive about going back to Kabarnet dormitory where the incident took place. The dormitory is popularly known as “Kaba”. One of the students said the dormitory will always hold bad memories for her. TRANSFER She has consequently asked her parents to transfer her to a day school close to their home in Kisumu. While the parents were coming to terms with the tragedy, another question that lingered on their minds is how the students will report back to school on September 15. The fire consumed all of their belongings. They expected to go home with substantial information – if they will get any support to buy items for their daughters – but both the school’s administration and the Board of Management (BOM) did not give immediate answers. One of the teachers requested the parents and students to remain patient as the school is also trying to come to terms with the death of the students. Post-mortem on the bodies of students who died in the Saturday fire is expected to be conducted Tuesday at the Chiromo mortuary.   Education CS links deadly blaze to arson attack.

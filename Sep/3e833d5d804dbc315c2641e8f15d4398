An Ethiopian national alleged to be an accomplice of a man gunned down at the residence of Deputy President William Ruto in July has been denied bond. Mr Ali Elema Wario, alleged to have been in constant contact with the attacker Mohammed Ibrahim Mohammud, who was killed on July 29 at Ruto’s residence in Sugoi will remain in custody until his case is heard and determined. Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot said the suspect is a flight risk. Mr Cheruiyot said the harsh penalties that will be imposed on the accused upon conviction is an incentive for him to disappear from the court’s jurisdiction. He also said the court has taken judicial notice of terror attacks in the country, which left a trail of deaths the latest being the one on Principal Secretary Mariam El Maawy. The magistrate also said the accused was said to be communicating with his accomplices outside the country and is “a great danger to the public if released.” The court also fined Mr Wario Sh50,000 or one month jail term for being in Kenya illegally. Mr Wario pleaded guilty to the charge of breaching the immigration laws by residing at the border town of Moyale within Marsabit County without a valid visa. He however denied the charge of being a member of Al-Shabaab.

Kenya will have to wait a little longer to find out if it will host the 2018 African Nations Championships after the latest round of venue inspection ended on Saturday. Kenyan football officials said the final decision will now be taken at the next Caf (Confederation of African Football) executive committee meeting in Accra, Ghana on September 23. It is expected the report by the seven-member Caf team, which conducted a third inspection of the four Kenyan stadiums earmarked for the 16-team event, will form the basis of that decision. Kenya was awarded the fifth edition of CHAN championship, which is exclusively reserved for African players playing in domestic leagues, in 2014 but the country's slow pace of preparations in terms of stadium infrastructure have been a cause of concern to the continent's football governing body. The Kasarani stadium, which hosted the International Federation of Athletics Association (IAAF) world under-18 championships in July is the only venue which meets the hosting requirements. The other three venues are Nairobi's Nyayo National stadium, Kinoru stadium in Meru and the Kipchoge Keino stadium in Eldoret. The 2018 Chan is expected to run from January 12 to February 4.   Sports Kenya have pumped in Sh230 million towards the renovation.

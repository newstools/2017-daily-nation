Kenya women s cricket team play Uganda on Friday in a play-off match which will decide which team plays Zimbabwe in the final of ICC Africa Women s World Twenty20 qualifiers. Kenya will be vying for a chance to play hosts Zimbabwe in Saturday s final in Windhoek.Zimbabwe (161 for 2 in 20 overs) topped the round-robin tournament when they beat Uganda (102 for 6 in 20) by 59 runs at the Wanderers Cricket Club yesterday.

The stand was broken when Abuga was clean bowled by Maria Enright (3/14).

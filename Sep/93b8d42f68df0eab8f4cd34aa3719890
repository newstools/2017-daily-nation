Fashion and lifestyle blogger Sharon Mundia has opened up about why she left social media for a year. Mundia, a popular blogger went off the social media radar just before she got married last year. In her You Tube channel, she goes into detail explaining that she felt she had lost clarity in her purpose. “…for a while I had been feeling unsettled  in my role as an influencer  or as a creative, I didn’t know how to be myself and I would just share because of sharing or because a contract says I need to put this up at this time and it wasn’t authentic, it wasn’t really me. It was making something that I once loved feel like a chore and a burden and I was starting to resent it. And after months and months of thinking about it I realised that there were a couple of issues I had about it, I didn’t know what my why was…”she said She continued “whereas I started my blog because I needed an escape because I was going through something in my life…at some point I was like, wait a second, I actually like this, let me do it for good. And then it became if I’m doing this solely then it needs to make financial sense, so now I’m doing it chasing the money. All that was good but that can’t be what is fully driving me yet it was something I completely enjoyed. It wasn’t clear what my purpose was and I started to feel guilty…it was driving me nuts…” Mundia ended the clip by saying she now knows why she is doing it and will be back to sharing stuff on beauty, fashion, motherhood, home décor and travel every Thursday.

Security agencies must move with speed to quell the violence that has rocked Narok County in the past few days, leading to the death of at least eight people. It is also critically important that they be seen to be both fair and decisive in dealing with those responsible on both sides to eliminate accusations of bias. Kenya is in a highly charged political State as it were and the police must not be seen to be weak in dealing with those behind the clashes, lest the conflict grows out of proportion. However, even as the police move in to stop the violence, community leaders from both sides must step up to the plate and ensure that peace and harmony are restored. CEASE HOSTILITIES But it will not be enough to call on the communities to cease hostilities; steps must be taken to encourage those who may feel aggrieved on either side to speak out on the issues that they need addressed. Sufficient security measures should also be put in place to shield schools from possible attacks to ensure academic programmes are not disrupted and the students preparing for national examinations are shielded from unnecessary anguish at such a critical time. If not nipped in the bud, such skirmishes could send the signal that some parts of the country are vulnerable to violence and this could be detrimental to national security given the prevailing political dynamics.

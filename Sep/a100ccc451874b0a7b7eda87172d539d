Thank you Brenda for your straightforward answers. I’m 27 and in a dilemma about this woman. We went to Primary School together and then re-united at university. On my graduation day, she even had my picture as her WhatsApp profile photo congratulating me.  When I asked her for a relationship, she declined. In fact, she seems to have lost interest entirely. She doesn’t answer my texts or pick my calls. I am confused.  What should I do?  There is nothing to be confused about here. You asked this woman for a romantic relationship and she said no. You should respect that decision.Another thing you need to do is to stop reading into things that are not there. The next time you are pursuing a woman, instead of studying her social media activity and trying to interpret what it means, try just coming out and asking the questions you want answers to. This way is easier. Trust me.  Do you have a question for Brenda? E-mail: lifeandstyle@ke.nationmedia.com

Should I stay or should I just use her and leave her?

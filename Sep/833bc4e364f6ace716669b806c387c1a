Police in Kisii County have arrested two suspects in connection with the theft of computers from the Nyamira County offices. The suspects, Mr John Omanwa and Mr Kefah Sagwe, the personal assistant of Governor John Nyagarama, allegedly stole eight computers. Five were stolen from the countyâ€™s Treasury offices and the rest from the Lands and Planning offices. The incident took place on Wednesday last week. Kisii County police commander Hassan Abdi said that the suspects spent the night in the Kisii police station cells. "We shall be handing the two over to the police in Nyamira County who are following up the matter," he Mr Abdi said. The theft took place just a day after Governor Nyagarama ordered an audit of the Treasury before new officials took over.

A section of business people in Molo, Nakuru County have vowed to spearhead the re-election campaign of President Uhuru Kenyatta, as Kenya prepares to go to the repeat poll on October 17. The business fraternity, constituting matatu owners, shop owners, traders and farmers, said they will take it upon themselves to maximize the voter turnout in the region. “We will hold a strategic meeting next week with all the stakeholders in the transport sector to plan on how people in the villages – those who are ill or elderly – will be ferried to their polling stations,” said Mr Charles Muraya, chairman of the Molo Business Community. Mr Muraya said the association is not part of the campaign teams that have been formed by the Jubilee Party, but is instead a brainchild of the community. He said the move was aimed at ensuring the Jubilee administration remains in power, saying this will create an enabling environment for their businesses. “Under the Jubilee government, the fees payable [for] our work permits have been reduced. We have also enjoyed improved security especially in Molo Town,” said Mr Muraya. He said the construction and renovation of roads has been a boost, especially to the farmers, who depend heavily on road transport to ferry their farm produce. “This time we are hoping for 99 percent voter turnout, not just in Molo Town but in all jubilee strongholds,” he added.

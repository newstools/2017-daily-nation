The Employment and Labour Relations Court has reinstated 38 Nyeri County ward and sub-county administrators fired by Governor Wahome Gakuruâ€™s government last week. The administrators moved to court through lawyer Davidson Warutere under a certificate of urgency, protesting that their contracts had not expired as claimed by the employer. The court has also annulled an advert placed in the local dailies inviting applications for the posts until the case is heard and determined. In addition, the court has directed the county government and the county public service board not to victimise any of the administrators.

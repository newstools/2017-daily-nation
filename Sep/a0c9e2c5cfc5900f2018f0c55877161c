The sixth edition of the Seeds of Gold Farm Clinic will be held this Saturday, September 30th 2017, at the Kalro Tea Research Institute (TRI) which was formerly known as Tea Research, in Kericho County. The event will be themed Investing Appropriately, Farming Sustainably and will feature agriculture specialists from main sponsors such as Elgon Kenya Ltd, Simba Corp Ltd, Egerton University, the Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Research Organisation and Nation Media Group’s Seeds of Gold, among others. Like in the past editions, this event will similarly feature teachings, trainings, knowledge-sharing, exchanging of ideas for better agribusiness practices, and demonstrations on the best farming practices and technologies that a farmer can adopt to boost both his/her livelihood and food security for the country at large. Farmers, agricultural enthusiasts and all those who wish to venture into farming, are thus encouraged to attend this event, with their queries on tea farming, food crop husbandry, dairy farming, farm management, agri-financing, all about pesticides and fertilisers, proper seeds for cultivation and effective transportation solutions for the farm, which will all be fully answered by experts and agricultural specialists from our sponsors. KEY IN BOOSTING AGRICULTURE “Previous editions of these farming clinics have proven instrumental in shining a light on the problems our farmers are facing and connecting them with experts and other players in the industry to exchange minds on the most innovative and hustle-free ways to grow food. The clinics have been a resounding success, bringing farmers from all corners of the country together to learn new forms of producing food,” said Mr Nelson Maina, the Public Relations and Communication manager at Elgon Kenya Ltd. These farming clinics which were initiated by Seeds of Gold Kenya and Elgon Kenya Ltd, are key in boosting the country’s agricultural productivity as through them farmers get a platform through which they can acquire farming extension services, agricultural inputs and the requisite knowledge on accessing markets and financing for their agribusiness undertakings.

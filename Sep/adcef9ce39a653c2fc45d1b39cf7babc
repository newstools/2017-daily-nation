Bumula MP Moses Wekesa Mabonga, who vied and won the parliamentary seat as an independent candidate has pledged to support Jubilee and campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta s re-election.Mr Mabonga said he will ensure President Kenyatta gets more votes in Bungoma in the October 17 repeat presidential election than he did on August 8.He was speaking at a rally attended by President Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto in Kimilili, Bungoma County on Wednesday.During the rally, President Kenyatta thanked Bungoma residents for voting for him on August 8 and urged them to vote for him again. STRONGHOLD We have come to thank you for supporting us in the August 8 election and to ask you to turn out in large numbers to express your supreme will on October 17, he said.He noted that Jubilee won four parliamentary seats in Bungoma County underlining the fact that the county is not an opposition stronghold. The Jubilee MPs in Bungoma are Didmus Wekesa Barasa (Kimilili), Daniel Wanyama Sitati (Webuye West), Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) and John Waluke (Sirisia).President Kenyatta called on the residents to shun the divisive and tribal politics propagated by the opposition, saying only in an environment of peace, unity and reconciliation which are key tenets of the Jubilee Party can development be achieved.RESPECT LAW President Kenyatta said he won with a clear majority but he is ready for a repeat election because he is committed to peace and respects the law.Deputy President Ruto expressed confidence that President Kenyatta will win the repeat election with a bigger margin. We will beat the opposition just like we did in August 8. In fact, we will double or triple our votes, he said. The Deputy President wondered why the opposition leaders had no faith in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and yet its MPs, governors and MCAs, whose elections were managed by the same electoral body have been sworn in. Why are they now saying they have no faith in the same body that made them who they are now? They should resign and seek fresh mandate from the electorate if they have no faith in IEBC, he said. email print email print

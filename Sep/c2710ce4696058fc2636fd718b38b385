The police officer who on Saturday shot his girlfriend dead in a cyber café on Nairobi’s Tom Mboya Street before turning the gun on himself has died in hospital. Constable Simon Njoroge Njau died at the Kenyatta National Hospital where he had been hospitalised since the incident. The officer who served in the General Service Unit (GSU) shot Anne Wanjuhi five times before shooting himself twice in his throat. He used his official Jericho pistol of serial number KP 40309165. Witnesses told Daily Nation that the officer went into Web Link Cyber Café located at Braidwood House along Tom Mboya Street opposite the Nairobi Fire Station and found Anne attending to a client. “He wanted to talk to her about their relationship because she had wanted to break up with him over the past two weeks,” a witness said. Anne was running her sister’s cyber business.   BUSY “Anne was attending to a client who was doing some applications. He insisted on talking but she said she was busy and needed to finish with the client because it was getting late,” a workmate, Ashford Hinga, said. He said when he was dismissed, the officer left the cyber café very angry and told her he would be back in a few minutes. Constable Njau, who had just known Anne for three months came back and found Anne packing her things in her bag. He tried talking to her, but she did not want to listen and so the officer shot her five times. He then turned the gun on himself, firing three times before a police vehicle arrived and took him to hospital. Anne’s body was taken to the City Mortuary.

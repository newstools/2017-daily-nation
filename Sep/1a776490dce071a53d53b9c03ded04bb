The National Cohesion and Integration Commission is investigating former Nakuru Town MP David Manyara over hate speech remarks. NCIC chairman Francis ole Kaparo on Sunday said that Mr Manyara, who is the Jubilee Party Nakuru chairman, is under investigation over inflammatory statements he made last week during a protest against the Supreme Court ahead of the release of the full judgment on the presidential election petition. "I ask the public to be patient and wait for the investigations to be concluded. Action will be taken if he is found guilty," Mr Kaparo said. WARAngered by the revocation of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s victory, Mr Manyara said of National Super Alliance leader Raila Odinga: "Let Raila be warned that we are ready for war. "He has been telling us that he is the only one with the people behind him. We want to tell him that from today the real Kenyans are going to rise up," he was captured in a video as saying. The former legislator added: "Let Mr Odinga know that [...] we will fight with those who are telling us that there will be no election. "It is not as if we are carrying children. If necessary those carrying children will have no choice but [to] put the children down and fight." INCITEOrange Democratic Movement (ODM) Nakuru branch secretary Hilton Abihola castigated Mr Manyara for trying to incite residents. "The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the NCIC should intervene quickly and arrest this man because these are some of the utterances that burn a country. "They should hold him accountable for threatening the peace of this county," Mr Abihola said. Mr Kaparo said they would not relent in fortifying peace efforts.   One of the demands Nasa wants addressed include hiring a new firm to print ballot papers.

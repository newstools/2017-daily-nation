Former Bomachoge Borabu MP Joel Onyancha is dead. His brother Evans Onyancha on Wednesday told the Nation that the ex-lawmaker passed on at the Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi where he had been rushed for treatment. PETITION Mr Onyancha unsuccessfully vied the Bomachoge Borabu parliamentary seat in the August 8 elections on a Jubilee ticket. He lost to independent candidate Zadock Ogutu and had filed a petition seeking to overturn the outcome. Evans said his elder brother might have suffered a heart attack. "He was watching the Supreme Court proceedings before being rushed to hospital by family members after he started feeling unwell," said Evans. MALPRACTICES In 2003, the High Court in Kisii nullified the election of Joel Onyancha as Bomachoge Borabu MP. This was the second time Mr Onyancha, then of The National Alliance (TNA), was losing a seat in an election petition. He suffered the same fate in 2007 when the High Court nullified his election. Justice Edward Muriithi who heard the case ruled that the election was marred by malpractices. The petition had been filed by poll losers Mr Peter Kimori of ODM and Mr Albert Nyaundi (Ford People).

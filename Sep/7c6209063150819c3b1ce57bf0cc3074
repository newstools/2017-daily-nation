At least seven people died and many others hurt on Wednesday in a road crash involving a lorry, two matatus and two personal cars. The crash happened at around 3.30pm at Rosters, between Jubilee Christian Church and the Church of the Lord, on Thika Road. STONES Nairobi County Commander Japhet Koome said the seven died on the spot, adding that police would release more details on the exact number of victims after checking with hospitals. The drivers of a Nissan and one of the matatus were among those who died, according to Nairobi Traffic boss Peter Ndung’u. Witnesses told the Nation that the collision began when a truck carrying stones burst its front right tyre. A 34-seater matatu from Mwiki to Nairobi was behind the truck. As the lorry driver struggled to regain control, some stones fell off. COLLISION “The bus tumbled on the stones that fell on the road and flew over the railings that separate the highway’s lanes. It was headed to Nairobi but on impact it flew to the lane heading to Thika,” said Mr Peter Mwangi, an eyewitness. On landing on the other lane, the bus rolled several times. A 14-seater matatu from Nairobi to Nyahururu was accelerating on the lane and its driver could not brake fast enough to avoid hitting the bus. The two collided with a huge impact. Two personal cars that were on the lane also crashed into the bus. CUTS “When everything settled, the lorry stopped in the lane leading to Nairobi while the other vehicles were on the other lane,” said Mr Reuben Ng’ang’a, a motorcyclist who witnessed the smashes. Glass and blood were strewn all over the road as rescuers pulled people who had been trapped in the vehicles. “Most of the injured suffered cuts on multiple body parts— some on the legs, others in the face, others on their backs,” Mr Ng’ang’a said. The crash led to a huge traffic gridlock on the busy highway, and it is after about an hour that traffic police managed to clear the road.

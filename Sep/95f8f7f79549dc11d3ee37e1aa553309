Have you heard of the beef between Khaligraph Jones and Eric Omondi? Word has it that their back and forth is apparently manufactured to promote the social media application Olla. The two have been using the hashtag #OllaAtMe in their supposed disses to each other. Feeling cheated already? Still Khaligraph maintains that Omondi is jealous that he is soaring to heights nobody could fathom. Khaligraph has said that the Untamed comedian is not happy about his success and that could be the reason for the friction between the two entertainers. “Not everyone will be happy for you when they see you making moves, making things happen. Some people, and he’s one of them, never thought I would be setting standards or taking the steps I am taking in my career. They see a young man who’s just emerged and they are scared,” he said. Khaligraph further said that this is the first he has experienced such negativity and hostility from a fellow entertainer adding that “mazishi ni ile ile”. The beef began when Omondi recorded a video of him giving a petrol station attendant money to help fuel and service Khaligraph’s Range Rover. Khaligraph later responded with a one-minute diss track that made a buzz online which further prompted Omondi to post a starter pack that included bleaching agent-a jab at Khaligraph on the rumours that he had bleached his skin.

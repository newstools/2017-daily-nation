Kikuyu elders have warned the contractor working on Ruring’u Stadium in Nyeri against cutting down Mugumo trees without their consent. This is after a commemorative fig tree ‘mugumo’ planted by President Uhuru Kenyatta was reportedly destroyed by goats in the stadium being built at cost of Sh500 million. Elders led by Kikuyu Council of Elders’ head Kariuki Kibui and high priest Mathenge Wa Iregi on Wednesday visited and inspected the site of the destroyed fig tree where they condemned the destruction. They issued a stern warning to the contractor and demanded that all fig trees on the ground remain protected even as construction of the stadium continues. PROTECTED “No fig tree on this ground should be touched or harmed. They must be respected and protected,” said Mr Kibui. The ground has four fig trees, three of which were planted by sitting presidents among them, the late Jomo Kenyatta and former president Daniel Moi. President Uhuru Kenyatta planted a fig tree as he launched the construction of the stadium in June this year. The tree, which was sourced from Kenya Forest Services (KFS) was however destroyed under unclear circumstances earlier this year sparking protest from the National Museums and the elders as it was viewed to be monumental. POLICE This was especially because it was planted by a sitting president and that it is a fig tree, sacred to the Kikuyu community. The National Museums officials actually reported the matter to the police Divisional Dog Unit, which neighbours the stadium, on September 10. “Once I noticed the tree had been destroyed I reported to the police and it was booked,” said Mr Anthony Maina, the Nyeri Museum curator. Sources privy to the case said police and the contractor were under pressure over the destruction of the tree. Investigations revealed that it was destroyed by some goats grazing in the stadium. The elders tended to the tree and it began to grow.

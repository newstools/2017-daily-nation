Mariam El Maawy was a close sister and confidant. She was also a strong, effective, selfless, driven and amazing leader. Loss is complex because it exposes deep grief borne from love, fondness and admiration. I loved Mariam, I was fond of her and admired the leader that she was. I received news of Mariamâ€™s demise as I prepared for an inter-regional meeting with the European Union to discuss the security situation in the Horn of Africa. Apart from the deep sense of hurt and brokenness that followed receipt of the news, I immediately knew that although we have consistently invested in a decade of national strength and security, the losses we have encountered must fuel our zeal to collaborate with others to put an end to terrorism and all forms of extremism. Mariam was a pillar of strength for her family, community, women, and children. She gave herself to a cause, whose dangers she understood, but whose benefits to affected families were immeasurable. TERRORISM She was attacked as she visited with families displaced by terrorism. Mariam will forever be remembered by all of us who loved her, worked with her, admired her and were led by her. Her family will feel her absence and the pain of this loss for a very long time. I pray that the Almighty Allah gives them the fortitude, strength and courage to accept his will and bear the loss with grace. To the families of the victims of this and other terrorist attacks, I will, with all colleagues in government, continue to engage with others, locally, regionally and internationally to bring solutions to this global threat. May you find comfort in the warmth and prayers of other compatriots, and in the uplifting words of our National Anthem: may justice be our shield and defender, and may we dwell in unity, peace and liberty.

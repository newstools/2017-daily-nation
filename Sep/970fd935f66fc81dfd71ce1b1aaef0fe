Newly elected and nominated MCAs in Embu have requested the county assembly to conduct a comprehensive induction training to educate them on legislative rules and parliamentary terms for easy transaction of House business.The MCAs made the appeal during Wednesday s sitting after several of them were ruled out of order for violating the assembly s Standing Orders.Most of them also arrived improperly dressed or did not know how to put across their points of argument, therefore causing confusion in the House.First-time MCAs struggled to engage in the legislative business on the floor without proper understanding of what was required of them, leading to a disjointed debate.HOUSE PROCEDURESMbeti South MCA Murithi Kiura noted that only seven MCAs out of 33 were conversant with House procedures and rules as stipulated in the standing orders.He expressed concern that the remaining 26 may find themselves baffled and disoriented by legislative requirements.Mavuria MCA Ngari Mbaka said most of the new MCAs will be ineffective if they are expected to legislate without first being trained. I am concerned that we are moving as lay people. Most of us don t know about Standing Orders. We want to [get] them so that we are conversant and effective in our debating, he said.CRAMMEDSpeaker Josiah Thiriku noted that most of the MCAs were crammed in benches on his right side on assumption that it was the government designated side and urged them to feel free to occupy any side.Gaturi North MCA Paul Muchangi called on the assembly s administration to organise for the training before engaging the new ward reps in serious legislative business.He added that some members may be unintentionally flout Standing Orders due to ignorance.Majority Leader Michael Njeru concurred that there was urgent need to train the new MCAs to bring their legislative skills at par with their re-elected counterparts.He pledged to sit with Speaker Thiriku and Assembly Clerk Jim Kauma to plan for a comprehensive induction training. email print email print

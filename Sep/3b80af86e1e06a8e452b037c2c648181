Former Meru Governor Peter Munya has joined the National Super Alliance (Nasa), promising to ensure that he regains the seat he lost to Governor Kiraitu Murungi of Jubilee in the August 8 elections. Mr Munya, who unsuccessfully defended his seat on Party of National Unity (PNU) ticket, was received Monday by Nasa leaders Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula at Capitol Hill, Nasa’s secretariat. Mr Munya said that he wanted to be on the right side of history. “I confirm that today I have joined the Nasa family. My election was stolen and I cannot join those who stole my election,” Mr Munya said. He said he has gathered enough evidence to prove his case and will be filing a petition in court to challenge Mr Murungi’s victory. Mr Munya was accompanied by Mr Mugambi Imanyara, who lost to Mr Mithika Linturi in the Meru Senate race and PNU officials John Anunda (secretary-general) and Peter Kaberia (national treasurer), who was also his running mate in the last election. Mr Mudavadi said that Mr Munya’s choice of Nasa is a great move as the coalition prepares for the repeat of the presidential election that was annulled by the Supreme Court on Friday last week. He said Mr Munya is as a great leader who has steered the leadership of the Council of Governors to great heights.

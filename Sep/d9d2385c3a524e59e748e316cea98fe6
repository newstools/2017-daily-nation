Leaders of devolved units and county assemblies have been urged to act as role models in labour practices by ensuring that no single gender occupies more than a third of all key positions in both the executive and the assembly. The International Centre for Policy and Conflict (ICPC) has said that, as major employers and service providers, county governments have a significant impact on the lives of women, youth and other minorities. This is by using fair employment practices and ensuring non-discriminatory service provision to locals. “County governance is going to be the major driver of Kenya’s political and economic development, considering that crucial sectors of the economy and social/public services are under their jurisdiction,” said ICPC executive director Ndung’u Wainaina. The organisation said it had observed that devolution is introducing greater participation, accountability and transparency in local governance and economic development.

Recently, the National Gender and Equality Commission said the country has a long way to go to achieve gender parity in political representation following the outcome of the August 8 elections. Only 96 women were elected as members of county assemblies in last month’s poll, out of the total 1,450 wards.

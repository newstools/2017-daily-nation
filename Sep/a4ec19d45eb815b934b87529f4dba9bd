Kenya’s hopes of reaching the final of the ICC Africa Women’s World Twenty qualifiers in Namibia were Friday dashed by their arch-rivals Uganda who beat them by five wickets at Affies Park, Windhoek. Uganda will now fight it out with Zimbabwe on Saturday for the single slot reserved for Africa in the ICC Global Women’s World Cup qualifier at a venue and date to be released by the ICC. Batting first, Kenya set a target of 90 for the loss of five wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Opening batswoman, Queentor Aoko, top-scored for her team with unbeaten 36 that came off 56 deliveries with three boundaries and a six. Aoko gave Kenya a flying start when she put on an opening stand of 33 with Veronica Abuga (8). Aoko also shared a fourth wicket partnership of 40 with Sarah Bhatika (25 off 21 balls with three fours). The duo were the only batters who posted double digit figures for their side. The other girls failed to cope with Uganda’s stiff bowling and tight fielding and lost their wickets cheaply — Margret Banja (8), Silvia Kinyua (1), Esther Wangare (0) and Venasa Ook (naught not out). Uganda wickets were taken by Getrude Candiru (2/18), Consylate Aweko (1/12) and Rita Musamali (1/3). In reply, Uganda reached the target, 90 with five wickets and a single ball of their allotted 20 overs in hand. Musamali top scored for Uganda with unbeaten 28 off 42 balls with a four. She shared a winning six wicket partnership of 34 with Immaculate Nakissuji (25 not out off 15 balls and two boundaries). Franklin Najjumba (12 off 19 balls) was the other player who did well with the bat while Ooko (1/24), Bhatikha (1/13) and Kinyua (1/7) took the wickets.Namibia (93 for 4 in 18.1 overs) won the match for the fourth place when they beat Tanzania (92 for 4 in 20 overs) by six wickets.

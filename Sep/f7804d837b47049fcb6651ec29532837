This was confirmed on Wednesday during the launch of the annual event at a Nairobi hotel, in a ceremony graced by Kandie and Athletics Kenya Central Rift boss Barnaba Kitilit. I am now in good shape and looking forward to that race. If the weather is okay, I m looking to dominate and settle for at least a podium finish, Jerotich said in Nairobi. The Labour CS said she was ready for the race. Let s see who will beat me. This initiative should be supported by all of us. It helps our young boys and girls go to school, Kandie declared. Kitilit also said athletes will compete in various categories, including men and women s 21km race, men and women s 10km race and the 5km races for boys and girls aged under 14 years. This time round, the whole race will be run on tarmac.

Nyandarua Governor Francis Kimemia has denied involvement in the Sh2.9 billion misappropriation investigation ordered by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Keriako Tobiko. Mr Kimemia said the revival of the case, which the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) had recommended that it be closed, was political and meant to taint his image as public servant. "It is very clear that I wasn't an accounting officer in the mentioned ministry. I was overseeing many departments as head of civil service," said Mr Kimemia while reacting to DPP's decision to oppose closure of the case. He questioned the timing of the investigation in which he is being probed alongside former Interior Principal Secretary Mutea Iringo. In May, EACC recommended to the DPP that the case be closed citing lack of enough evidence. Mr Kimemia served as head of the civil service under President Mwai Kibaki and later under President Uhuru Kenyatta. He was mentioned in the infamous EACC dossier that targeted senior civil servants but the anti-corruption agency gave its report a few months later. He successfully vied for Nyandarua gubernatorial seat in August 8 General Elections.

Dear Brenda,I m a final year university student going through a rough time. I have lost hope in everything to the point of indulging in drugs. I have tried applying for several jobs to cater for my expenses and none seems to go through. Most of the time, I am alone and sometimes I even get suicidal. Please help.Perhaps it will help you to feel better if you know that no one really has an easy life, even those who seem to have it all together.One thing you could do about your predicament is stop focusing so much on the job market. What can you do with your hands to make money? What talents can you utilise? How about starting a small business that meets the needs of those around you?Also, avoid spending your time alone. Find activities that interest you or new hobbies where you can spend time with other people. If you are still feeling suicidal call 0722178177 (Befrienders Kenya)Got a question for Brenda?

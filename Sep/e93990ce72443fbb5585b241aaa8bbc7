The floodgates of election petitions appear to have been thrown wide open after the Judiciary on Wednesday revealed that it had received 116 so far. Although the merits of the cases will have to await hearings and determination, it is imperative that they are dispensed with expeditiously and judiciously. Already, the rising political temperatures caused by the Supreme Court order for a fresh presidential election are exerting an adverse effect on trade. The Nairobi Securities Exchange has lost tens of billions of shillings of investorsâ€™ value. Indeed, a survey of CEOs shows that elections hurt the business environment. REPEAT POLL On the education front, there is already robust debate on whether the school calendar should be adjusted to pave the way for the repeat poll. All these political developments emphasise the need for the petitions to be speeded up to avoid further economic slowdown. However, it is important for the magistrates hearing the 62 cases and the judges determining the other 54 to ensure that speed goes hand-in-glove with justice. Where elections are found to have been marred by irregularities, fresh ones must be held within the shortest time possible to ensure political competition does not get in the way of other national undertakings. Where the results are upheld, the courts must give sufficient grounds to eliminate the need for appeals.

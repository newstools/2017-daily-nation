Two weeks ago, Athletics Kenya (AK) president Jackson Tuwei revisited the thorny issue of doping. Speaking in Nandi County, he told athletics officials and managers from Kapsabet, Iten and Eldoret that they must do more to root out banned substances. Doping has been particularly prevalent among runners in the local athletics camps with Olympic marathon champion Jemimah Sumgong, marathoner Rita Jeptoo, middle distance runner Agatha Jeruto and long distance runner Matthew Kisorio all convicted by the IAAF. Like most athletics fans, the retired general is worried that if something is not done urgently young and talented athletes run the risk of being ruined by doping as they seek shortcuts to success and riches. WADA Tuweiâ€™s views are shared by responsible sports personalities and administrators, including IAAF and World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) officials. Three months ago, 2007 World 800 metres champion Janeth Jepkosgei expressed fears that upcoming athletes were being ruined by doping. She urged AK, Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya (Adak) and top Sports ministry officers to visit the affected areas in a bid to to deter doping. While it is laudable that the athletics fraternity has identified the problem, they must move with speed to address it conclusively. They can start by enforcing the anti-doping laws that were enacted last year.

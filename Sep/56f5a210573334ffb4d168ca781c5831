Farmers and suppliers of agricultural products have been asked to actively participate in joint trade fairs as a way of exposing themselves to modern trends and potential markets. Naivasha Hortifair chairman Richard Mcgonnell said the trade fairs would help to enhance food security, and create employment especially for the youth. Mcgonnell, who was speaking at the annual event last week, said the exhibition had worked to bring together farmers and suppliers of agricultural products and potential buyers of farm produce in bid to synergise the sector. Others who attended the event were integrated pest management experts, among others. In total, the show attracted over 160 exhibitors, approximately the same as last year and 3,300 visitors. Last year, the show attracted 3,200 visitors. “Through the exhibition, we were able to create a platform for investors and farmers to meet top professionals in various fields in a social environment,” he said, adding the exibitors also had time to meet their clients and share experiences. Nelson Maina, the communication manager at Elgon Kenya, one of the exhibitors, said it was not only a meeting for various stakeholders, but also an opportunity to jointly address challenges and opportunities. “It is a timely event because of the numerous challenges the sector faces, which include rising number of pests occassioned by changing weather pattern,” he said. Naivasha is home of Kenya’s horticulture industry as it hosts numerous flower and vegetable farms whose produce is mainly for export.Kenya is the world’s third largest exporter of cut flowers, accounting for about 40 per cent of all sales in the European Union, according to the Kenya Flower Council. The country’s flower success is attributed to its favourable climate, which enables a year-round cultivation of high-quality blossoms without the need for expensive-to-run greenhouses. Kenya is famous for its roses, carnations and summer flowers (flowers grown in the open).

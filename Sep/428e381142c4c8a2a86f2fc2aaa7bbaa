Opposition MPs on Tuesday made good their threat and skipped the opening of the 12th Parliament by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The MPs instead trooped to Kibera for a Nasa rally. Two Opposition MPs were seen in the National Assembly but they left before the opening in the afternoon. AGENDAHowever, Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa and Kwanza’s Ferdinand Wanyonyi did not get into the chambers. “I have not come for the opening of Parliament as I will not get into the chambers,” Dr Wamalwa said when asked about his presence. ODM chairman John Mbadi said he did not attend the opening because the first sitting of any newly elected House is supposed to be used by a newly-elected President to spell out his agenda to the country. “We could not attend Parliament to listen to a temporary President who is basically a lame duck and who would basically be reading Jubilee’s campaign propaganda to us,” the Suba South MP said. 'ROGUE' MPsAlego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi said he could not be part of an “illegality” and therefore stayed away. However, two Opposition MPs defied the call to boycott the first sitting. Webuye East MP Alfred Sambu (ANC) and his Hamisi counterpart Charles Gemose attended the opening of the 12th Parliament. Mr Sambu said he could not miss the event because it is a national function which should not be politicised. NO EFFECTEmbakasi West MP George Theuri said the no show by the Opposition MPs was not good as it works against the spirit of national unity. In Parliament, Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi and Senate’s Kenneth Lusaka said the House was properly constituted despite the absence of Opposition MPs and proceeded with the agenda of the day.   The President said Jubilee has the numbers to transact business.

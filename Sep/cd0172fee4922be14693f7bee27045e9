Kenya Breweries last year paid Sh2.2 billion to 30,000 sorghum and barley farmers, the beer maker has announced. The Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) currently sources 80 per cent of its raw material locally but the firm now says it plans to raise this to 100 per cent by 2020. This is part of a new campaign, ‘Growing Value Together’, through which KBL plans to balance growth in profit with giving back to the communities in which it operates. “We have made huge strides in aligning our business operations with the aspirations of the communities in the areas where we operate, driven by the realisation that we cannot build a business in isolation,” said KBL Managing Director, Jane Karuku. In addition to sourcing materials locally, KBL said it is also cutting down on its energy use by five per cent each successive year. Already, the company has slashed water usage in plants by 40 per cent.

Corporates are increasingly embracing sustainability as they seek to give back to the community and take care of the environment. For instance, telecom firm Safaricom has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals as part of its company targets.

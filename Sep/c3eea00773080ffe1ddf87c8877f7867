The University of Nairobi has moved one position up to be ranked the 11th best university in Africa even as it trails peers in research, female student enrolment and lecturer-student ratio. The Times Higher Education World University rankings, released last week, shows that the university has improved from position 12 last year. The University of Nairobi and Uganda’s Makerere (position five) are the best higher learning institutions in Eastern Africa, while University of Cape Town in South Africa leads the pack in Africa.

The report indicates that Nairobi is, however, the worst performer among its peers in research work with a score of 9.4, behind Makerere University (11.6). University of Cape Town has a 36.2 grade in research, Africa’s best.

Foreign envoys in Kenya have termed the Supreme Court's decision to nullify President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory as "an example for Africa and the world" In a statement sent to newsrooms two hours after the 11am ruling and signed by 24 foreign ambassadors, the envoys also congratulated the Kenyan people for "showing patience and confidence" in the legal system. No presidential election in Kenya has ever been nullified before. UNITED STATES "Kenya's electoral institutions must now begin preparing for a new presidential poll later this year and we urge everyone to work to make it free, fair, credible and peaceful. We have trust in the ability of Kenya and its citizens to do so," the statement read. In the ruling issued on Friday, the court said the electoral board committed "irregularities and illegalities" during last month's vote, harming the integrity of the election. The court also ordered another presidential election to be held within 60 days. HISTORIC Envoys, who appended their signatures include United States ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec and Nic Hailey, the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom. Others are Bruno Pozzi (European Union), Jutta Frasch (Germany), Ralf Hecner (Switzerland) and Mette Knudsen (Denamrk). Amnesty International also termed the ruling that overturned the results of the August 8 presidential election as historic. It “sets an example for the rest of the world,” the human rights group added in a statement by Justus Nyang’aya, its director for Kenya. “We urge all parties to comply with the judgement, and call on the police to observe restraint in their handling of any celebrations or protests that may follow this landmark ruling,” Mr Nyang'aya said.

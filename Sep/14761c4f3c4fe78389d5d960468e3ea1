Chief Justice David Maraga on Monday attended the opening of the Commonwealth Magistrates and Judges Conference, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. His introduction at the conference was greeted by a thundering cheer from participants. Judge Maraga, who recently led the Supreme Court in a ruling to invalidate President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in last month's election, declined to give interview to journalists.

A police officer is among three people, who have been arrested with ivory in Nairobi. The three people were arrested in Nairobi West with five pieces, weighing 25 kilograms. A vehicle that they were using to ferry the ivory was also seized by the Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) personnel who arrested them. They are being held at the Langâ€™ata Police Station. KWS head of Corporate Communication Ngugi Gecanga said the three are being interrogated. "We believe that they are part of a cartel and so we want to find more members and operatives," Mr Gecanga said. He said the Ivory was being transported from Isiolo and that the suspects were heading to meet with a buyer.

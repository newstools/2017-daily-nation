Over 2,000 farmers have been affected and blamed their plight on pesticides they collect from Thirikwa cooperative. “We do not know the disease but it began when we sprayed the coffee with chemicals we collected from the factory store,” said Peter Ndung’u, a farmer. According to the farmers, the berries change from red to almost black once sprayed.“For every disease, we have sprayed with the right chemicals but this has beaten us,” said the cooperative chair Silas Karoki. He denied the farmers’ claims and accused those peddling them of opposing the current management.The farmers said they now fear being auctioned because of the loans they took from cooperatives and banks.The situation is so bad that production in the cooperative society has dropped by about 80 per cent. Last year, the cooperative harvested 230,000kg from over a million kilos the previous year.By Irene Mugo **** Varsity readies to host its fifth annual agribusiness trade fairThe University of Eldoret will host its fifth agricultural trade fair from Sep 21 to 23.Prof Teresa Akenga, the vice-chancellor, said technology and modern farming innovations will be at the centre of the exhibition. “Kenya is currently susceptible to adverse effects of climate change and it is the duty of farmers to be innovative and come up with solutions. We will showcase them at the fair,” Prof Akenga said.Mr Rik Martens, the agricultural development policy officer at the Netherlands Embassy, which is among the largest sponsors of the fair, said Kenya and Netherlands share a history in development partnerships and the two countries are essentially moving away from an aid-based partnership to a more trading one as equal partners.“We have been involved in numerous agricultural development programmes and intend to keep doing so thus ensuring our two countries get to the level of trading as equal partners especially in agribusiness,” said Mr Martens.By Brian Okinda

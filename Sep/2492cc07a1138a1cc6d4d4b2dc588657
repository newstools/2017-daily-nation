Wema Sepetu, a famous ex-girlfriend of Bongo Flava superstar Diamond Platinumz, seems to have rescinded her earlier statement that she would get rid of her uterus if she had not conceived by the time she hit 32. The actress is no stranger to controversy and has been constantly been hitting Tanzanian showbiz headlines with her statements and announcements. DONE EVERYTHINGThe actress, 29, says she has done everything humanly possible to get pregnant and there is nothing else she can do but wait for God’s perfect timing. “Nampenda mtoto nimpate hata sasa hivi kwa sababu nimekuwa nikitaka mtoto tokea nina miaka 24 sasa hivi nina miaka 29. Kiukweli it’s draining me every day not being able to conceive. Lakini nasema kwamba sijakata tamaa Mwenyezi Mungu najua ana mipango yake na ukikataa sana tamaa pia unamkufuru na mimi ni mtoto wa Kiislamu sitaki itafika point nitaanza kumfukuru Mungu. Nina Imani kwamba God’s time is the best time acha tuone. Itakavyokuwa Inshallah.” (I would love to have a baby, even right now, I’ve had that wish ever since I was 24 years old. Right now I’m 29 without success. Honestly, it’s draining me every day, but I haven’t given up and I wouldn’t want to because that would be going mocking God. I wouldn’t want it to get to that point. I will wait because I believe God’s time is the best) Wema says she has to live with insults every day from her large following because of not being able to conceive. LOST PREGNANCYIn 2016 while in a relationship with former Big Brother winner Idris Sultan, Wema conceived but lost the pregnancy through a miscarriage. In January 2015, Wema confessed her regret in regards to aborting the late actor Steven Kanumbas’ baby, defending herself by saying that she wasn’t ready at that time to be a mother. It is widely believed in Tanzanian showbiz circles that one of the key reasons Diamond dumped was that she was her inability to conceive.

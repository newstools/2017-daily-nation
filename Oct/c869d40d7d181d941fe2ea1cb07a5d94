Athletics Kenya has made a sensational disclosure that four junior girls were molested in a private house that was transformed into an “athletics training camp” in Keringet, Nakuru County.  An investigations committee led by AK officials, which visited the camp on Friday, was shocked to learn that the camp where the junior girls were housed was a private house. The “camp” is supposed to have housed both girls and boys, but the investigating team was shocked to learn that only girls were in the house. At least 12 girls were undergoing the harmful training. The AK team, led by the association’s youth sub-committee chairman Barnabas Korir, Elizabeth Keitany (member) and Japeth Kemei, who is the secretary of AK’s South Rift Branch, moved into action and visited the “camp” to investigate claims of girls’ molestation. The AK team was shocked by the deplorable standards of the facility. “This was not a camp because where on earth do you have young girls aged between 14 and 16 years being inappropriately massaged by a shameless adult who has bad intentions, pretending to be an athletic coach,” lamented Korir. He said only chaperones or a doctor are allowed to touch such girls. Korir said that they spoke to the four girls and established that indeed they were molested. “We have gathered very credible information that indicates that indeed the girls were inhumanely manhandled while at the so called camp,” said Korir. He said the investigating team also went to Kabarnet in Baringo County and interrogated some of the victims who bolted out of the camp after the ordeal. 
  
According to AK, investigations are at an advanced stage.

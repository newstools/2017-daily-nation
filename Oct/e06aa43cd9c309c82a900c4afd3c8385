Blocked roads are hampering distribution of election materials in Migori County. County IEBC co-ordinator Charles Mutai said they were encountering serious challenges in reaching the eight constituencies. INACCESSIBLE "It's tough ...We started distribution of poll materials today but some areas are still inaccessible," he said. Mr Mutai described the situation as "50-50" but hoped security officers will help them to clear the blocked roads in good time. On Tuesday night, police in Migori engaged Nasa protestors in running battles near the teachersâ€™ training college where election materials were said to have been kept. Gunshots rent the air as the opposition supporters attempted to gain access into the Migori Teachers College. CORDON Police formed a cordon around the institution even as they repulsed the hundreds of demonstrators during the 7pm incident. The protestors retaliated by blocking the busy Kenya-Tanzania highway with metal containers and boulders. People heading to the Tanzania were forced to spend their night in Migori hotels due to the standoff. The repeat presidential election is set for Thursday.

Stray Lions on Sunday mauled Swamibapa who were at home at Nairobi Jafreys by six wickets in their Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Super League match.  The Lions earned 18 points from the win as Swamibapa settled for a single bowling point. Former national skipper Collins Obuya blasted an unbeaten half a century 67 runs that came off 60 deliveries with six boundaries and three towering sixes. Obuya shared a winning fifth wicket partnership of 69 with Neil Narvema (23 not out off 37 balls with three boundaries). SENT TO PAVILION Batting first, Swamibapa scored a paltry 101 by the time all their batsmen were sent back to the pavilion in 29.3 of their allotted 50 overs. The batsmen failed to cope with Lions’ stiff bowling and tight fielding and lost quick wickets without meaningful runs showing on the scoreboard. Morris Ouma top scored for the side with 21. Alex Obanda 13, Saumil Patel (12) and Emmanuel Bundi (12) were the only batsmen who managed to post double digit figures on the scoreboard Sirla Srinivas was Swamibapa’s main executioner taking four wickets for 22. He was supported by Nehemiah Odhiambo (3/19) who was playing against his former team.

The third instalment of this franchise proves that it is trying to keep up with the first two movies that wholly delivered on fun, family, and the continuation of Steve Carell’s voice animation career. And yes, we are indeed ignoring the Minions movie, which once again, like Penguins of Madagascar, goes to show that the hilarious little sidekicks don’t always make the best movies. Gru, well ensconced in his family life with his wife and kids, discovers that he has a twin brother who, upon meeting, feels is much better than him, especially considering his mane of golden hair in comparison to Gru’s baldness. In the middle of that plot, a villain stuck in the past, who is fond of shoulder pads and is a huge fan of the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, is trying to make everything go back to the days when he was a big deal. And of course, the minions provide some laughs. Will the brothers take him on? I’m glad I finally got to watching it. And I have a feeling there’s going to be a fourth one...

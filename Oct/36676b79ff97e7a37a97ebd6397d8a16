DEMONSTRATIONS He was then ushered into a vehicle where two other officers were waiting.  Mr Oketch said the officers never mentioned any charges against him. "These officers never told me why I was arrested. They only said I am among leaders who organise demonstrations in Kisumu."  Since his arrest, he said, he has been held at different police stations: Chemelil, Koru, Kericho, Chagaik and Sosiot. CRIMINAL On Sunday morning, he talked to his wife Mercy Akinyi and lawyer Francis Olel. "There is no need to arrest him like a criminal, his phones confiscated.

Mr Kathurima said the MCA is likely to be charged in a Kericho court.

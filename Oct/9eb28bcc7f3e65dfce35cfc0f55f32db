Leaders in Kirinyaga and Nyeri have accused National Super Alliance (Nasa) leader Raila Odinga of plotting to plunge the country into chaos through his resistance movement and asked the government to investigate him. Kirinyaga County Senator Charles Kibiru on Thursday said the resistance movement is illegal and meant to cause violence in Kenya. Speaking at Getuya Primary School in Ndia constituency after casting his vote, Mr Kibiru said the movement should not be allowed to operate in the country. DISRUPT Mr Kibiru said the opposition leader was unhappy over the repeat presidential election, which he boycotted and could do anything to disrupt peace. He called on the government to be alert and take action against protesters who are preventing voters from casting their ballot. Former Kirinyaga Governor Joseph Ndathi said police should not allow the opposition to plunge the country into chaos. Addressing journalists at Rukenya Primary School in Gichugu constituency after casting his vote, Mr Ndathi said Mr Odinga had been inciting Kenyans since he withdrew from the presidential race. DEATHS “He is no longer popular and he should retire from politics,” said Mr Ndathi. Kandara MP Alice Wahome told Mr Odinga to take responsibility for deaths of protesters as he is the one who called for demonstrations. “Mr Odinga is solely responsible for the chaos, the investigating agencies should summon him and charge him in court,” Ms Wahome said. She also said the opposition committed an electoral offence by holding a rally on Election Day eve. “The law states that no candidate shall conduct political meeting 48 hours to the election. Mr Odinga violated this law when he organised a meeting at Uhuru Park on October 25 and should face the law,” she said.

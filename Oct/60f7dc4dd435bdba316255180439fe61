Bottom placed side Muhoroni Youth on Sunday sunk deeper into relegation after a comprehensive 3-0 loss to Kakamega Homeboyz at their Muhoroni stadium grounds.  It was Muhoroni’s 14th loss of the season, and this pushed them closer to demotion, although they still have some five games to make amends.  In Thika, the relegation battling duo of Thika United and Mathare United settled for a one-all draw as Western Stima jumped from 17th to 15th place on the log after beating 2009 champions Sofapaka 3-1 in Narok.  At Ruaraka, former Sofapaka defender Felly Mulumba made a rare entry into the score sheets with his first half header which helped Bandari to a 1-0 win over league debutants Nakumatt. The flurry of goals in Muhoroni began in the 25th minute when Wycliffe Opondo beat Muhoroni goalkeeper Gradus Ochieng with a long range shot, and the hosts’ back line crumbled afterwards to allow Homeboyz easy penetration.  The visitors were at it once again in the 32nd minute, when club top scorer Jeremiah Wanjala got himself in good position inside the goal area before sending a rasping shot past Ochieng’s reach.  Veteran striker Francis Ocholla, formerly of Muhoroni Youth, put the icing on the cake just three minutes later to complete the rout in the first half rout. Always calm and collected, Homeboyz coach Mike Mururi told Nation Sport after the match that he was elated with his team’s performance, as it had made up for their disappointment in their two previous games.  “I wish they could have played like this last week when we played Nakumatt, or in the previous match when we played Zoo Kericho, because then we would have been assured of our position at second place.  “This is however a good place to start from and I hope that we shall maintain this kind of performance in the remaining games,” he said.  RESULTS Muhoroni 0-3 K. Homeboyz  Nakumatt 0-1 Bandari  Sofapaka 1-3 Western Stima  Thika United 1-1 Mathare United

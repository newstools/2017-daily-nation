Carl Tundo scored his fourth win of the Guru Nanak Rally after clinching victory in the latest round of the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship on Sunday. Tundo, the former Kenya champion, who won his first Guru Nanak Rally in 2009 followed by another in 2011 and 2012 respectively, led from start to finish to win the latest round of the Multiple Carriers-sponsored event at the wheels of his Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10 navigated by Tim Jessop. “It went very well for us right from the start to the end. We set fastest stage times in all the stages to proof the car and its drivers behaved well and to the true tune of the competition. We are very happy to get back to winning ways. The rally was good,’’ said Jessop at the end of the rally.  Former national champion and also a winner of the famous event in 2013, Baldev Chager was placed second overall with Ravi Soni in yet another Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10.  Jasi Chatthe, yet to return to his old form, which earned him the KNRC and ARC titles two seasons running, was placed third overall in his familiar Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10 with Gugu Panesar as his co-driver. Ian Duncan, navigated by Amar Slatch in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10, was placed fourth overall. Duncan was seeking his 13th victory of one of the longest running rounds of the KNRC series since his first win in the 1986 event in an Opel Manta.

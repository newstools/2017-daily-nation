Nominated MCA Beth Nyawira was Tuesday kicked out of the county assembly over indecent dressing. The MCAs was found to have broken the Speaker's rules on the dress code dressing barely a week after the assembly Speaker John Kaguchia warned members against dressing indecently. She was dressed in a short sleeveless dress contrary to the guideline by the Speaker that requires women MCAs to wear a coat to avoid exposing their arms. RULE Kirimukuyu MCA Anthony Ndagita took issue with youth representative dressing and asked for direction from the Deputy Speaker Samuel Kariuki. “Mr Speaker kindly guide this house on the mode of dressing of the honourable member. The Speaker recently ruled on how MCAs should dress,” he said. Mr Kariuki ruled that Ms Nyawira had broken the rules and ordered that the Sergeant at Arms escorts her out of the assembly. Mr Ndagita said it is necessary MCAs are corrected on their dressing to ensure assembly respect is not compromised. Nyeri County Assembly Speaker John Kaguchia had asked MCAs to be cautious of their dressing to avoid tarnishing the assembly reputation following concerns by Karatina MCA Watson Mburungo that female MCAs were wearing miniskirts. The female MCA had just walked out of a committee meeting where the nominee for Youth, Sports and Social Services Sheila Githaiga was appearing for vetting. Mr Nyawira, who is the chair of Youth, Sports and Social Services committee had opposed the nomination of the 65-year-old to the docket.

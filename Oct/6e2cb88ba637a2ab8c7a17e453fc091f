Kenya Ports Authority men’s basketball team made a giant step towards a top two finish in the Kenya Basketball Federations men’s Premier League table when they beat Trailblazers and Lions at the KPA Makande Hall at the weekend. The maximum four points collected helped the dockers, who have two matches to conclude the season, leap frog from position six to fourth in the log with 37 points. Ulinzi Warriors lead the table on 40 points while Co-operative bank and Blades are second and third with 39 and 38 points respectively. Should the dockers win their remaining two matches against USIU and Ulinzi then they finish the regular season top of the log.  The post season play-offs tip off on November 4. Against Lions on Saturday evening KPA were held 14-14 in the first quarter but outscored their opponents 24-6 in the second quarter for a 38-20 half time score before eventually winning 65-48. Lions’ Brian Kuria scored a game high 14 points while Victor Ochieng lead KPA with 11 points. KPa obliterated Trailblazers 84-52 a day earlier, leading in the first quarter 22-12. But the Blazer outscored them in the second quarter 30-15 to take a 42-37 half time lead. Sensing danger, KPA returned in the second half breathing fire. They registered a huge 22-2 score line in the third and 25-8 score in the fourth to put the game beyond the visitors Frank Omondi (12), Evans Leting (11) and Samuel Ochola (11) top scored for KPA.

Police officers Friday shot and killed a man who was part of a gang that stormed the home of former Karachuonyo MP James Rege in Kanjira, Homa Bay County. Homa Bay Police Commander Marius Tum said two others are nursing gunshot wounds. Mr Victor Muga, 20, was shot dead while Cleavance Odhiambo and Samuel Jeremiah were injured when, together with other youth, attempted to raze down Mr Rege's home in Pala village on claims that he was hiding ballot papers that were marked in favour of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Rege, who did not defend his seat, was the lead campaigner of Mr Kenyatta in Nyanza in the August elections. Mr Tum said the injured were taken to hospital for treatment. "Our officers responded quickly and shot in the air to disperse youths who attacked the home of Mr Rege," he said. Mr Rege accused local politicians of being behind the attack. "I have told police that the attack was organised by senior politicians in the county," he said.

Two MPs have been admitted to Lira Medical Centre after they collapsed when police fired tear gas and live bullets to disperse a consultative meeting on the age limit Bill in Lira District. Dokolo Woman MP Cecelia Ogwal and Otuke woman MP Sylvia Akello were on Tuesday hospitalised after inhaling tear gas fired by police. AGE LIMIT The two had joined a consultative meeting called by Lira woman member of Parliament Ms Joy Ongom at Adyel division play ground to consult her constituents on the proposed amendment of the Constitution to remove article 102 (b), which caps presidential age limit at not less than 35 or above 75 years. Ms Ogwal and Ms Akello had planned to hold a joint consultative meeting with other MPs from the neighbouring constituencies. Other MPs at the meeting were Charles Angiro of Erute North, Felix Okot Ogong and Jonathan Odur of Erute South constituency. ROWDY Police started firing tear gas as soon as the other MPs joined Ms Ongom on the podium. All the MPs were wearing red ribbons, which has been won by politicians opposed to the removal of the presidential age limit. However, the crowd became rowdy and started pelting the Lira police barracks with stones, leading to running battles. 
  
MPs will only be allowed to hold consultations in their constituencies.

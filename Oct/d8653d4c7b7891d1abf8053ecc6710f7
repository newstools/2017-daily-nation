Royal Nairobi Golf Club’s Jay Sandhu and Railway’s John Lejirma both shot one over par 72 to tie at the top in Day One of the 2017 Kenya Open Amateur Championship at the challenging Nyali Golf and Country Club course Mombasa on Friday. Sandhu’s score included a double at the par five-fifth hole after hitting a tree on the left side of the fairway on his approach shot. Before that, he had also dropped a shot at the stroke index one-fourth and later on at the sixth.  He, however, birdied the seventh for two over par at the first nine. “My game was generally good save for a few holes. I like the course, I think it is the best in the country at the moment," said Sandhu, who later birdied the 14th and 15th to tie with Lejirma who birdied two holes with two bogeys.  Following the two was Eldoret Golf Club chairman and Kenya Golf Union representative in the North Rift Andrew Chelogoi, who shot two over par 73. Tanzania’s Isaac Wanyeche and Anthony Kinuthia of Golf Park tied in fourth place on three over par 74 each. Four others tied on four over par 75.  They included home player John Timbe, youngster Kibugu Mutahi and Edwin Mudanyi of Vet Lab. On Saturday, the field of 84 players will be off as early as 7am for the second round which will be followed by the third round in the afternoon. 
  
The pros were joined by amateurs drawn from various clubs in the country on Friday.

This year’s Kenya Basketball Federation men and women’s Division One League play-offs begin with two opening quarter-final matches at Upper Hill School in Nairobi on Saturday from 2pm. According to the fixtures women’s Division One League leaders Masaku Sparks will open their campaign to make a comeback to the Premier League next year against lowly rated Gladiators. Coach Justus Akhwesa’s Masaku Sparks booked a ticket to the best-of-three series quarters play-offs after finishing top on the 10-team table standings with 34 points. Masaku won 16 matches and lost two to qualify for the play-offs.

Gladiators finished the second leg a head of Egerton University and KCA-U, who were in the last two positions. Masaku Sparks have had a weakness of lacking a technical bench with only eight players and coach Justus Akhwesa is expected to fully utilize forwards Pamela Sinda and Eva Chebet to make a flying start in their quarter-final opener.  Gladiators, on the other hand, had a mediocre regular season and they should prove themselves by coming out with a different approach in the competitive play-offs. In the men’s Division One play-offs quarter-final, regular season runners up Emyba will square it out with seventh placed 4 Christ in the opening Game One Saturday at 2pm.  Emyba finished second behind KDF Morans with 34 points after having won 14 matches and lost six outings.

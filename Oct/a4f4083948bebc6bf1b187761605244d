The plan to construct a Sh5bn industrial park in Kirinyaga County is in jeopardy after the land set aside was grabbed. Deputy Governor Peter Ndambiri said that the 250-acre land, which belongs to the county government, was allocated to private developers. "This land is meant for public utility but it has been illegally taken over by highly influential personalities," he told residents at Kibingoti market on Saturday. CORRUPTION Mr Ndambiri said grabbers colluded with some former land officials to acquire the land in Sagana. "We have a mega project and the land must be reverted to the government. We can’t allow few individuals to benefit from a public land," he said. The deputy governor further observed that land grabbing in the region is rampant but his administration is working on ending it. "Grabbing of public utility lands is rampant in the area and the vice should be fought at whatever cost," he added. FARMERS On transportation, he said the Kagio–Kandongu road that is in a pathetic condition will be tarmacked by the national government. Mr Ndambiri said that farmers were delivering their produce to the market late. "We have lobbied for the tarmacking of this road and very soon the construction work will start."

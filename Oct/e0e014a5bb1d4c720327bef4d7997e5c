It’s quite reassuring to note that the government has reiterated its commitment to renovating national sports facilities despite the recent embarrassing development, which culminated in the country being stripped of the rights to host next year’s Africa Nations Championship (Chan) by the Confederation of African Football. The confirmation has come from none other than Sports Principal Secretary Kirimi Kaberia. Mr Kaberia has given an assurance that the Sh4.2 billion allocated for the renovation of the stadia will not be diverted to other purposes even after the Chan setback. MODERN FACILITIES The country is seriously short of modern sports stadia and other vital training facilities. The renovations commissioned by the government are the first major step in solving the problem. Indeed, the last major modern sports facility was constructed three decades ago. Quality stadia are important. They offer our athletes and other sportsmen and women the best possible platforms to train and play in, plus confidence to go on and become world beaters. Quality stadia will also give the country a better bargaining position in the event that it bids to host international sports events such as the Commonwealth Games in future.

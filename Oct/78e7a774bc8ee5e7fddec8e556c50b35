The possible SportPesa Premier League decider pitting runaway leaders Gor Mahia and former champions Ulinzi Stars that was slated for the Afraha Stadium this Sunday has been moved to the Kericho Green Stadium on Saturday. Hosts Ulinzi Stars have been forced to look for another venue for the match after they were informed Afraha Stadium had been booked for a political rally scheduled for the same day. “We’ve been informed the stadium has been booked for a political rally over the weekend. The game therefore will be played in Kericho and we call upon our supporters to show up in numbers and rally behind the team," Gor Mahia’s Organising Secretary Judith Anyango said. Gor Mahia are just one point away of an unprecedented 16th title. Dylan Kerr’s troops will be targeting a draw to attain an unassailable lead at the helm of the table. Gor tops the standings on 63 points, 15 ahead of second placed Sofapaka. The first leg ended in a 2-2 draw at the Moi Stadium in Kisumu County. Ulinzi played out to a goalless draw against Zoo on October 14 in their last visit to Kericho, while Gor Mahia stopped champions Tusker 2-0 in their last match at the venue on September 23.   The runaway leaders got a perfect start after Tuyisenge opened the scoring after 13 minutes.

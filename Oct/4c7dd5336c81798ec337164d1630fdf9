It was a clean sweep for the Kenyans in the this year’s Amsterdam Marathon-men’s category after Lawrence Cherono ran a brilliant race breaking a course record set by compatriot Daniel Wanjiru last year on Sunday. Cherono won the race in 2 hours 5 minutes and 9 seconds 09, ahead of fellow Kenyan Nobert Kigen who finished in 2:05:13 while Abraham Kiptum was in third place after clocking 2:05:26. In the women’s category, Tadelech Bekele won in 2:21:54 ahead of Kenya’s Gladys Chesir who finished in 2:24:51 while Azmera Abreha was third in 2:25:23 sealing the podium. In the Sofia Marathon in Bulgaria, another Kenyan Barmao Kiprono crossed the line first in 2:14:49 ahead of Ahmed Nasef from Morocco who finished in 2:17:29 while Ugandan Vitalis Kwemoi came in third. Kenya’s Ruth Matebo cut the tape in 2:40:30 to win the women’s category ahead of her compatriot Koech Cherono who stopped the clock in 2:40:33 while Leena Ekandjo from Namibia came in third. And at the Lisbon Marathon, Tokyo Champion Sarah Chepchirchir defended her title after running a brilliant time of 2:27:57 ahead of chasing Ethiapians Afera Godfay (2:28:46) and Shichala Kumeshi (2:38:52) who were second and third respectively. In Amsterdam, Cherono broke away after the 37km on his way to lowering Wanjiru’s 2016 time by 12 seconds.  Cherono said that he had planned to attack the race with about five kilometres. “I decided to break away in the 37km mark and it worked for me well. I’m so happy to have won the race and even broke the course record,” said Cherono. Cherono has been training in Kaptagat and his storming run in the Netherlands marks him out as an athlete to watch. Kipruto who had been tipped to win the race said that he got blisters in the last few kilometres that made him slow down.

A controversial televangelist in Malindi Paul Makenzi and his wife were Tuesday charged with promoting radicalisation. Mr Mackenzie and his wife, Joyce Mwikamba were also charged with failing to provide basic education to their three children. The two denied the offences that also included offering basic education in an unregistered school at Good News International Ministries Church. FREE BOND The offences are said to have been committed on diverse dates between August 28 and September 29 at the church. However, the court released 19 other people, who had been detained alongside the couple, on free bond. They were not charged. In a sworn affidavit, Corporal Collins Barasa said investigations had established the 19 suspects, arrested together with Pastor Makenzi, were innocent. The officer said 93 children, who were rescued during the operation, have been taken to various children and remand homes for care and counselling. The children are aged between four and 13 years. CHURCH The charge against the couple stated that they knowingly and unlawfully promoted extreme beliefs to facilitate ideological religious and social change at his church in Furunzi area. State Counsel Alice Mathangani asked the court to deny the accused bail as they are likely to interfere with investigations. “The witnesses in this case have their spouses still attending his church and they might influence them if released on bail,” she added. The accused lawyer Mr James Mouko, however, opposed the application saying it would violate their constitutional rights. He said the couple have a six-months-old baby, who has been denied the rights to be with the mother since her arrest 23 days ago. The magistrate will deliver the ruling on bond on Wednesday.

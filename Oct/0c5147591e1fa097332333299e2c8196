However, Mr Kieng said police have put in place mechanisms to deal with anyone disrupting the poll. He urged Kwale residents to maintain peace. "Police are patrolling the area and others which we deemed insecure. We have mapped out places we suspect to be insecure and deployed enough police. We will respond promptly to any eventuality using the helicopters," he said. Mr Kieng also warned residents against demonstrating without police notification.

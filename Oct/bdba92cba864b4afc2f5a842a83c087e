Splintered parts of the helicopter that crashed into Lake Nakuru on Saturday have been found. The pilot file and First Aid kits were found on the Northeastern part of the shore and near a sewage area in Lake Nakuru National Park.   However, the five passengers have not been located. Mr Jonathan Kertich, a desk officer at the National Disaster Operation Centre, says they have marked six spots within the lake where they are hoping to find the bodies. He said some oil spills in the lake have been traced by the choppers flying around the park.   Those missing are Mr Sam Gitau, Mr John Mapozi, Mr Anthony Kipyegon, a woman identified as Veronicah and the pilot Apollo Malowa.   The helicopter, model 5Y-NMJ, owned and operated by Flex Air Charters, was attached to the Jubilee campaign team and had left Jarika County Lodge in Nakuru Town, shortly before it crashed.   Despair and fury filled the air as the rescue mission delayed staring almost eight hours after the crash.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has asked PNU leader Peter Munya to withdraw an election petition he has filed against Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi. Addressing rallies in Laare and Maua town on Friday, President Kenyatta said he is ready to mediate between the two politicians and that the Jubilee government would offer Mr Munya a job if they win the October 26 repeat election. “I urge Mr Munya and Governor Murungi to meet and resolve their differences. I am ready to chair the talks to see them work together,” he said. The President and his Deputy William Ruto were received by Mr Murungi and a host of other leaders in their tour of Meru County. UNITY Also present were Igembe North MP Maoka Maore, Kubai Iringo (Igembe Central), John Paul Mwirigi (Igembe South), Josphat Gichunge (Tigania East), John Mutunga (Tigania West), Kathuri Murungi (Imenti South), Mugambi Rindikiri (Buuri), Rahim Dawood (North Imenti), Kawira Mwangaza (Woman Rep) and Senator Mithika Linturi. Former leaders including Ms Florence Kajuju, Mr Joseph M’Eruaki, Mr Mpuru Aburi and Mr Kinoti Gatobu also attended the rallies. While lauding the show of unity among Meru leaders, President Kenyatta said he was ready to accommodate politicians who lost in the election. In a rare show of solidarity, all elected leaders and former MPs attended the meetings where they called on residents to turnout in large numbers to vote for Mr Kenyatta. The President urged the residents to turn out in large numbers to ensure he secures victory by a large margin in the repeat election. The president said his government would address various challenges facing locals including insecurity, lack of water and markets for their produce.

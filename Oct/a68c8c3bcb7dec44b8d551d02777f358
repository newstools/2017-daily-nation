Alliance for Real Change presidential candidate Abduba Dida has called on Kenyans to participate in the repeat presidential election on Thursday and not be used by politicians to disrupt the voting. Addressing journalists on Sunday in Nairobi, Mr Dida said debate should shift from whether there will be an election on Thursday or not, to who is the best candidate to lead the country. “I urge Kenyans to vote on October 26. Kenyans should only be worried about the country succeeding. If we do not consider peace on Thursday, there will be no country. Those who do not want to vote should stay at home and not interfere with those who want to exercise their democratic right,” said Mr Dida.

SAME PLAYERS “If Raila will be elected or President Kenyatta given another term, Kenya will go nowhere. They are the same players and they will not solve your problems. I am the solution,” he said. He blamed the current problems facing the country on power only revolving around five tribes, lack of integrity among leaders, lack of trust among Kenyans and on religious leaders who have joined political power brokers instead of castigating their ills and excesses. At the same time, Mr Dida also dismissed the National Prayer Day terming it blasphemous, saying politicians must respect God.

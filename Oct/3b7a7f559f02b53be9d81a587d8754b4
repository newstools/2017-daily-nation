Nakuru County government will invest in theatre and art to create jobs for the youth. Deputy Governor Erick Korir on Friday said the introduction of prime arts and comedy segments in nearly all television stations was a clear indication that art is a paying venture. “The county government will make good use of the available theatre infrastructure and scout for emerging talent across the county,” Dr Korir said while hosting the Propesa Comedy Group. Dr Korir noted that it is crucial for counties to fully utilise homegrown talent in all their events. Mr Kimutai Ruto, whose stage name is ‘Propesa’, said the county should help promote and protect local artistes against exploitation. “To start with, the county can organise a quarterly cultural and creative event where all artistes would join and exhibit their work and learn from those who have made it in the industry,” Mr Kumutai suggested. Dr Korir said the county is committed to working with musicians, comedians and other artists in their public events.

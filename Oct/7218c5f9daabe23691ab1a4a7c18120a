Traders at Kongowea market in Mombasa are counting huge losses after their stalls were razed by fire. The fire started at around 7.30pm on Saturday destroying property of unknown value. According to the traders at the largest market in the Coast region, the incident was caused by an electric fault. POWER OUTAGE Kisauni OCPD Christopher Rotich said investigations are ongoing. The fire started after a power outage. "We are aware that electric lines had some problems, which resulted in the inferno that has seen a number of the traders lose their goods worth thousands of shillings," Ms Veronica Wachira, the secretary-general of Kongowea market central committee traders' association, said. CLOTHES A trader, Alice Kamau, said she lost second hand clothes worth Sh200,000. "I don't know where to start. I am confused. I just can't imagine this has happened to me. "I bought the clothes in the morning only for them to be gutted at night," she said. FIRE BRIGADE Another trader, Kassim Njenga, said he lost his entire business. "My stall has been reduced to ashes. I will have to start from scratch. It so painful for me as I am the breadwinner. I don't know what to do," he said. Ms Wachira called on the county government to have firefighting trucks within the market to curb future incidences.

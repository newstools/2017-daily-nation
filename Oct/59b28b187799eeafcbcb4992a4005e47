The killing of five students and a watchman at a school in Turkana County in the wee hours of Saturday once again brings into focus the need to ensure the safety of young people in boarding schools. Even though this northwestern region of the country is notorious for lawlessness, this is no excuse for the laxity that the attackers might have taken advantage of. And it does not matter whether the killers were foreigners or locals. A school in such a far-flung area is a soft target, hence the need for the authorities to do more to protect such institutions. It is also unfortunate — and perhaps a sign of desperation — that the locals, incensed by the brutal attack, took the law into their own hands, lynching one of the suspects. JUSTICE Indeed, the message from this is that if the authorities cannot ensure security and justice, mobs will take matters into their own hands. There have been other incidents in the recent past that have revealed dangers that students in boarding schools are exposed to day and night. The dormitory fires are a grave example. Even more worrying, as this and the recent fatal incident in Nairobi seem to show, is that some students are a danger to their colleagues. It’s not because of lack of stringent rules and regulations for boarding schools that these incidents are occurring increasingly. Rules must be strictly enforced and better ideas on how to enhance security sought.

The mother of Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege, Susan Wairimu 68, has succumbed to injuries following a fatal road accident at Githumu on Githumu Kangari road. Her body has been preserved at Githumu Mortuary. According to Murang'a County Commander Naomi Ichami, Ms Wairimu was with her husband Chege Mutema 75, in a Nissan Station wagon that collided head on with a Toyota Noah that was carrying Unaitus Sacco staff. She said Mr Mutema, who sustained serious injuries from the accident, was taken to Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, alongside four other Unaitus Sacco staff. "Mr Mutema and his wife were heading to Githumu while the vehicle carrying Unaitus Sacco staff was going in the opposite direction when they collided head on at a sharp bend," said Ms Ichami adding that two Unaitus Sacco staff were treated and discharged.

IN KAMPALA Kenya Ports Authority survived a late rally from Tanzania’s ABC to beat them 81-77 for their second straight win as the Fiba Africa Zone Five basketball club championships entered day two at Lugogo Indoor Courts in Kampala on Monday.  This happened as championships debutants Equity Bank of Kenya beat Tanzania’s  Don Bosco 68-48 in their opening match at the same venue.  Against ABC, the dockers who together with Rwanda Patriots and City Oil of Uganda are championships favourites, led 16-9 in the first quarter before racing to a 34-21 half time lead. Canada-based Desmond Owili, a replacement for Bush Wamukota  who returned to the US two weeks ago, was KPA’s game changer scoring a huge 21 points to lead the Kenyan side through a difficult last quarter. KPA were outscored in this quarter but had done just enough to walk away with the win. Other scorers for KPA, who have a difficult fixture against Uganda‘s Betway Power at 9pm on Tuesday were, Airel Okal and Victor Odendo,  who contributed 11 points each. Frank Majura scored a game high 28 points to lead ABC, who have a date with Ethiopia’s Gondar City on Tuesday. In the women’s match comfortably led 18-9  in the first quarter and 29 -16 at the break with red hot Hilda Indasi nailing 20 points five of them from behind the arc. Equity played minus head coach David Maina, who remained behind for personal reasons, but it showed little as they dictated the pace. Belinda Okoth scored 14 points. Claud Irene Luhanga scored 12 points for Don Bosco who lost their second straight game 84-74 to Rwanda’s APR Monday morning.  In other matches, defending champions City Oil from Uganda 93 -46 after leading 49-19 at the break while Partriots from Rwanda defeated Savio from Tanzania 79 -50.

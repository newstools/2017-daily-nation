Hi Brenda, Promise you will not judge me. I'm 33 and dating a 23-year old girl. She is in her fourth year of study but the age difference is not the issue. We have been dating for three months now and you might say the "honeymoon" period is over but hear me out. My issue is that she prefers to communicate by text or WhatsApp and when she does, she uses (Nay, overuses) Emojis! At first it was cute, and it got cuter when w grew closer but now it just feels like an Emoji attack whenever she chats me up. Call it a pet peeve but it has reached a point where I make the point of calling instead of texting so that I do not get attacked my Emojis and whatever other symbols she uses. Generally she is a nice chic so I don't want this to be the thing that causes us friction in an otherwise okay relationship. How do you think I should handle this? Dude, this whole column is about passing judgement, but let's leave that aside and get to business, shall we? You are dating a girl who is a decade younger than you are. Did you honestly expect the generational gap not to creep up and glare at you once in a while? Lucky for you, you can point out exactly what it is about the gap that is bugging you. Let's say this together: Emojis are not the problem here. Clearly, you have not told her how you like to be talked to and so she is innocently serving you an Emoji overdose. you need to have the talk with her: Kindly, sweetly, respectfully and add a smiley face if you must. A heart-eyed Emoji if you have to. But talk to her. If you can't, load up your phone and keep calling. Relationships have survived much worse than Emoji overloads. Good luck!

She just joined campus so is there a possibility of peer influence?

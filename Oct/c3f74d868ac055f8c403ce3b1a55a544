The Tanzanian government has banned a Swahili tabloid, Tanzania Daima for 90 days for allegedly publishing false information. The ban was announced by the government spokesperson Dr Hassan Abbasi, who is also the director of Information Services. “The government has banned Tanzania Daima from publication for continuously publish false information,” he posted on his Twitter account. Later, the Information Services department released a statement indicating that the tabloid was banned for publishing several stories with false information. The stories include one published on its Sunday edition on the number of Tanzanians on anti-retroviral drugs. The headline of the article stated that 67 per cent of Tanzanians are on ARVs. The newspaper acting Editor Martin Malera told The Citizen in a telephone interview that the newspaper has received official communication from the government. “We have received a letter at 3:36pm today informing us on the decision,” he said. Tanzania Daima becomes the fourth local newspaper to be banned from publication this year.  Others are Mawio, Mwanahalisi and Raia Mwema.

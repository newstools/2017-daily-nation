IN KAMPALA, UGANDA Champions Kenya Ports Authority women basketball team take on arch-rivals Equity Bank on Saturday in a must-win match in the Fiba Africa Zone Five Club Championships match at the Lugogo Indoor Courts. KPA need to beat Equity on Saturday and pray that UCU lose to KCCA to be crowned champions. KCCA face Uganda Christian University (UCU), who were playing Kenya's Equity in a late fixture Friday, in Saturday's decisive encounter.  On Friday, Betty Kananu scored a game high 25 points as KPA inched closer to their title defence with an emphatic 82-58 win over Uganda’s KCCA at the Lugogo Indoor Courts.  LOST TO UCU The dockers, who have lost one game 68-69 to UCU, were a breathing fire from the tip off against a determined KCCA side that needed to win the match to stay in contention for the title in the competition being played in a round robin format.  Kananu, who had eight assists, also sank three 3-point shots to lead the dockers to a 25-16 first quarter lead before going for the break 37-24 ahead.

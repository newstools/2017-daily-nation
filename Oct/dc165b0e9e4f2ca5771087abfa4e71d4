The Kenya Medical Training College's Kisumu Campus has been closed for a week following demonstrations by Opposition supporters. Principal David Okatch said learning has been suspended to protect students from harm. KMTC is located in Kondele, a hotspot for the Nasa protests that are being held three times a week against the electoral commission. "We are concerned about the safety of our students during this demo period. "Our institution is behind the Kondele police station and few meters from the Nyamasaria, Kondele by-pass," he said.   75-year-old granny suffers bullet injuries as she leaves hospital.

It is all systems go for the repeat presidential election set for tomorrow as the electoral agency Tuesday evening received the last consignment of ballot papers. The plane carrying the papers touched down at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) at 6.30pm. No IEBC commissioner was at the airport to receive the consignment but a few IEBC officials led by the commission’s warehouse manager Benard Nyachieo were at the airport to ensure smooth clearance of the batches. "I can confirm that this evening we have received the last batch of 160 pallets of the ballot papers to be used on Thursday," Mr Nyachieo said. "All the ballot papers will be distributed this (Tuesday) night,” he added. 14 COUNTIES The last consignment of the ballot papers were for 14 counties including Nairobi, Kericho, Bomet, Nakuru, Kiambu, Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Machakos, Kitui and Embu. Mr Nyachieo also said that the ballot papers will also be taken to parts of Nyamira County. The printing of the papers which was done in Dubai by the Al Ghurair company was overseen by senior IEBC officials together with officials from the Kenya Bureau of Standards. The printing was delayed as the electoral commission had to wait for the conclusion of a case filed by Thirdway Alliance leader Ekuru Aukot at the High Court in which he sought to be included in the ballot. Dr Aukot won the case.

The high political tensions in the country played out in the mainstream media on Tuesday morning, when an opposition politician walked out during a live studio interview with a rival legislator. Despite continuous persuasion by NTV anchor Ken Mijungu to stay on during the heated 'AM Live' morning political show, Rarieda legislator Otiende Amollo walked out some 45 minutes after the show started at about 7am, moments after Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa walked in. OFFENSIVE TWEET Mr Otiende said he could not share a panel with Mr Ichung'wa over a tweet he claimed was posted by the Kikuyu MP "Ken allow me to leave. I cannot sit on a panel with Kimani Ichung'wa because he sent a tweet that I find offensive, a tweet that suggests its okay to maim and kill Luos," Mr Amollo said as he unplugged the microphone pinned on his chest. Mr Amollo was referring to a tweet that went viral on Monday, apparently suggested Ichung'wa applauding the police killings in the ongoing opposition demonstrations. Pinned to apologise by Mijungu, Ichung'wa however distanced himself from the tweet. "That's not my Twitter account," Mr Ichung'wa said. FAKE ACCOUNT "I only have one Twitter account. I am in the process of having it verified. I even suspect these fake accounts are being created and operated by Nasa propagandists." "To the Luo nation, if there is someone you will never find fuelling ethnic hate, it's Kimani Ichung'wa. Most of my friends are Luos and Somalis." Despite this explanation, Mr Amollo still made good his threat and walked out of the show, which also had Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi in attendance. Incidentally, Miguna Miguna who was expected to be a panellist on the very show, failed to turn up.   Dr Akombe urges politicians to engage in dialogue in solving the political stalemate.

Rugby fans are still coming to terms with the disappointing news that this year’s Safari Sevens tournament has been cancelled. The reason for shelving this annual festival is the current hostile political climate. However, it is also true that the Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) has been struggling to get sponsorship and to attract top rugby playing nations and clubs for the tournament. Held consistently since 1996, the Safari Sevens is one of Kenya’s premier sports competitions. However, since it shifted from the traditional Ngong Road venue to the Nyayo National Stadium and, eventually, to Kasarani, the tournament has lost its rich heritage, fan base and splendour. CLIMAX Ironically, the cancellation of this year’s tournament comes against the backdrop of a successful National Sevens Series. The Safari Sevens would have been a fitting climax to the season. With Kenya having shown interest in hosting one of the IRB World Sevens Series rounds in Nairobi, shelving the Safari Sevens is unfortunate. We should not lose the gains of the last two decades in which Kenyan rugby has made tremendous strides.

On a bright sunny day, a week today, cheerful spectators, vintage and classic car, and motorcycle competitors and dedicated officials gathered at the Nairobi racecourse for the 47th edition of the annual Concours d’Elegance organised by the Alfa Romeo Owners Club and sponsored for the sixth time by CBA. The event was one of the most close fought in the series with Diccon Wilcock’s 1934 Railton finishing one point ahead of the 1952 MG TD sports car of his wife Julia. Diccon also had the satisfaction of winning the pre 1940 class and his team took home the best team car awards. The tussle for the top motorcycle was equally nail biting with Sati Jabbal’s 1925 DKW finishing only one point ahead of the 1929 New Henley of Johannesburg based Bevan Beckmann. It was a great day for Sati who also won the up to 900cc street bike class and the category for competition motorcycles. In addition he captured the award for the best motorcycle costume. Legendary rally driver Ian Duncan contested the competition car class with a 1972 Ford Capri racing sports coupe. This immensely powerful machine was driven to victory by the late Bill Parkinson and Peter Hughes at the Embakasi track and Bill won the touring car and track champion titles.  Duncan won his class and received a meritorious award for achieving a high standard of preparation. Second place went to the 1975 Mitsubishi Colt Lancer of Alpine Auto Parts. This car was built by the late Joginder Singh to the same specification as his Safari Rally winning machine. Gilgil classic car enthusiast Fergus Robley was placed third in his gleaming red Alfa Romeo GTA. Tumaini Muthiga was one of the competitors with multiple entries and he won the class for utility vehicles made up to 1974 with his gleaming blue 1965 Chevrolet pick-up and took second place in the up to 3000cc touring car class with his 1967 Ford Taunus. He followed Gayling May’s 1967 Alfa Romeo Sprint which has been a regular class winner for several years. The 1972 Austin Mini of Vitafoam Products Limited was highly successful finishing fourth overall only one point behind Veronica Wroe’s 1934 Rolls Royce Boatail. Veronica was delighted with taking third overall, second in the pre 1940 class and winning the car costume prize.  Several of the 12 Uganda car entrants featured on the prize list with Ronald Walusimbi winning the up to 2000cc touring car class in his immaculate 1974 Mercedes followed by Kakooza Wazzir’s 1980 Toyota Corona. Kakooza was placed second with his eye catching 1991 Mitsuoka le-Seyde in the 2000cc touring car class which was won by Claude Mwende in a Peugeot 406.

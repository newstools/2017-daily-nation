JOHANNESBURG Impressive World Cup qualifying form has lifted Tunisia back to the top of the Fifa Africa monthly rankings after 15 years. The "Carthage Eagles" last occupied first place in January 2002, having risen to the top six months earlier. Tunisia are on the verge of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia after defeating and drawing with the Democratic Republic of Congo and trouncing Guinea. Winning 4-1 in Guinea this month was a landmark success for coach Nabil Maaloul and his squad as Tunisia lost four previous World Cup qualifiers in the west African nation. Tunisia lead DR Congo by three points in Group A and need one point from a home fixture against Libya on November 11 to be sure of finishing first. Egypt, who booked a World Cup place by beating Congo Brazzaville last weekend, dropped one place to second while Morocco climbed three slots to seventh. AFRICAN TOP 10 1.

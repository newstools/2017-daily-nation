Hi Kitoto, I dated a man for two years without knowing that he was married with two children because he lives away from them and only visits them. I have tried everything possible to get over him but always end up missing him. Whenever he calls me, her reawakens my feelings for him. I still love him very much and don’t know what to do. Please help.  Hi, In every relationship, each party must agree to the rules of engagement. These rules stipulate what one would might refer to as acceptable and unacceptable conduct. No one gets into a relationship blindfolded. As a rule of thumb, do your homework well before committing. Disclosure must remain at the heart of any meaningful engagement. In your case, it looks like your surprise discovery about your man did not even shock you. I say this because, even after the discovery, you somehow still feel justified to pursue the relationship. My question is, what really matters to you? Is it a matter of values or are you letting your feelings get the better of you? Sadly, many who do this get their fingers burnt in the process. I suggest that you determine what looks right. However, do remember that what feels right might not necessarily lead to the right destination. The choices a person makes has great implications for the future. Since this man is married with children, you are actually setting yourself for some battles. In fact, many people will start seeing you as out to break someone else’s home. As far as this man is concerned, I really don’t know here he stands. However, I hope you will do what you would want others to do to you.

Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei has said Kenya’s Commonwealth Games and World Half Marathon teams will be picked next month. “We will sit down and select the marathon teams early because they are now in the process of signing their new contracts. Before they plan for the next season we will have to engage them so that we can select a Commonwealth Games team and a World Half Marathon team,” said Tuwei. Tuwei also said that he was sure the Kenyan athletes would perform well in the upcoming events as they have done before. “We have always performed well in various events internationally and we need to do better in terms of training so that we can remain on top,” said the AK president. He urged athletes to begin early preparation and ensure they participated in local competitions to build up well for the major international events. He was speaking on the sidelines of the 27th edition of University of Eldoret Cross Country Championships held over the weekend. Kenya will also send a team to the 21st Confederation of Africa Athletics Senior Championships that will be held in Nigeria.

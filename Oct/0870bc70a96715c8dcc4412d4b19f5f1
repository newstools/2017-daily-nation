Police in Busia are interrogating Matayos MP Geofrey Odanga over allegation of inciting violence during Thursday’s repeat presidential election. The ODM legislature is being grilled by detectives at the Busia Police Station. It is claimed that Mr Odanga organised and paid goons to disrupt the exercise in his constituency. "Yes, we are interrogating him to help us with investigations over violence that erupted in Matayos yesterday and poll materials destroyed at some polling stations," Busia OCPD Masai Makau said Friday. Mr Odanga, the Busia ODM chairman, has been on the forefront agitating for reforms at the electoral body and was among opposition leaders in the region who led the anti-IEBC protests. Thursday’s repeat poll was marred with disruption across the county as rowdy youth attacked poll officials.

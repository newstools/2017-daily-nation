The National Super Alliance (Nasa) has announced that demonstrations to push for reforms in the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) will resume Tuesday and will proceed daily until all the necessary changes are realised and free and fair elections held. In a statement, Siaya Senator James Orengo said the coalition’s demand for free and fair elections is imperative to safeguarding Kenya's democracy, long term stability and winning the people's trust in institutions. “Our constitution grants us the right to protest, and we will continue doing so peacefully despite being met with violence and intimidation each time. As a people, we have overcome such tactics before. We shall overcome again,” Mr Orengo said. Last week, the coalition suspended its thrice-a-week demonstrations to allow it to mourn its supporters whom they claimed were killed by police in Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Migori and Nairobi. The senator said there is no rationale for IEBC to spend public funds on an election that even the commission itself has said will not be free and fair nor credible and urged the electoral agency to call off the poll. Nasa has repeatedly urged IEBC to call off the fresh election. The coalition has pleaded with all participants in the demonstrations to refrain from any acts of violence or destruction of property.

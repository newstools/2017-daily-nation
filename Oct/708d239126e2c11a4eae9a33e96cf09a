Nakuru’s Madison Square Garden will explode into fireworks Thursday when the fifth leg of the SportPesa National Boxing League gets underway. It will be a battle of the disciplined forces when runaway league leaders Kenya Police Boxing Club’s “Chafua Chafua”, who have amassed 60 points, battle for top honours with second placed Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) who have collected 57 points. A total of 16 teams will be on parade for the three-day tournament.  Kenya Police, under the guidance of veteran coach and former national heavyweight champion George “Foreman” Onyango and his deputy David Munuhe, will go full blast to stay on course to retaining the title. Spearheading the police attack will be the 22-year-old Shaffi Bakari in the light flyweight contest. ENTERTAINER He will be the boxer to watch after his first ever international fight in Congo Brazzaville where he qualified for the World Championship alongside KDF’s Nick Okoth. “He is the youngest boxer in the national team and since he took over from Peter Mungai, he has proved that he is equal to the task,” said veteran coach John Waweru of Kenya Police. Bakari is a joy to watch in the ring as he loves dancing around like the former international Ibrahim “ Surf” Bilali during his hey day.  However, he will face a stiff challenge from hardened Matayo Keya of Kenyatta National Hospital and Abednego Kyalo of KDF. Other experienced boxers to watch in Nakuru and are on top form are Nick Okoth (lightweight) and Benson Gicharu of Kenya Police. Gicharu has featured in the last two Olympic Games, as many Commonwealth Games and All African Games competitions and it would be interesting how he slugs it out with rookies. Mombasa’s 19-year-old Brian Agina is another attraction in the bantamweight.  The sixth and the final leg will be held in Mombasa.

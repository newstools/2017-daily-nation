The Kenyan men and women’s hockey teams are in Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. Much will be at stake because the championships in the city of Ismailia double as the 2018 World Cup qualification. We believe that with our adequate preparations, the one-week battles should yield success. WORLD CUP The winners will represent Africa in next year’s World Cup in India (for men) and England (women). It’s 44 years since Kenyan men made their last appearance in the World Cup, having excelled in Africa and globally from the 1950s to the 1980s. Our women have yet to qualify for the world event, where South Africa have been the African queens. PERFORMANCEAs the players work hard to regain lost glory, the government and the Kenya Hockey Union must ensure that they are well-motivated. With the South African women’s team having already qualified after finishing fifth in the World Hockey League, Kenya has a great opportunity among Ghana, Egypt, Zambia and Nigeria. But, the men will have to dig deep as there is only one slot for Africa. This is after Egypt and South Africa finished eighth and ninth, respectively, in the World League, failing to get the automatic qualification. The other teams are Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia. We look forward to great performances.

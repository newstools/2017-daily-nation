It becomes the 31st chartered public university. TERRORISMPresident Kenyatta also appointed Prof Hellen Sambili as the chancellor of the university. The President on Monday said the move was a triumph for the institution that was targeted by terrorists two years ago. “Kenya will always triumph over those who preach hate, evil and destruction,” President Kenyatta said at State House, Nairobi. “I am confident that Garissa University now has the capacity to provide quality university education.” LEARNING Deputy President William Ruto expressed confidence that the institution will contribute to the provision of quality education. “Garissa University will not only serve the people of northern Kenya but the whole country,” Mr Ruto said.

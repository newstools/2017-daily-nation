KAMPALAA court in Kampala has fined an MP Sh1,140 (USh40,000) for an offence of being a public nuisance. Legislator Ibrahim Abiriga of Arua Municipality Tuesday appeared before the Kampala City Hall Court and was charged with urinating on the Ministry of Finance wall fence.  He pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a fine or spend two weeks in jail.  The MP was released after paying the fine.  Prosecution told court that the MP committed the offence on September 25 this year on Kyaggwe Road in Kampala.  The prosecution said the MP’s action was against the Kampala Capital City Authority Maintenance Law and Order Ordinance, 2016.  Mr Abiriga, who has lately been in the news for supporting the proposal to lift presidential age limit had admitted in a televised interview that he stopped to relieve himself as he was “badly pressed.” “Should I have kept urine on myself? What is the problem with that?” Mr Abiriga posed.  His confession came after several pictures of him urinating on the roadside went viral on social media.

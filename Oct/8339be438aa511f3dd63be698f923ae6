A seventeen-year-old student was killed early on Wednesday morning after a boda boda she was travelling on crashed head-on with a matatu. The girl was tossed under the vehicle near the Salvation Army quarters on the Kakamega-Webuye road and crushed to death. SURVIVORS The rider and another student escaped unhurt. The girl was a student at Ebwambwa Secondary School in Kakamega County. Western region traffic boss Geoffrey Njogu said the rider lost control of the motorcycle after a tyre burst and “ended up in the path of the oncoming matatu resulting in a head-on-collision. One of the students on motorcycle died on the spot.” The girls were on their way to school. DILAPIDATED The stretch of the road from Lurambi to Shimalabandu is notorious for accidents attributed to the dilapidated highway, forcing motorists to swerve to avoid potholes and rough patches. “What has happened is quite unfortunate since we have carried out frequent campaigns to sensitise motorists and other road users to exercise caution to avoid loss of life through accidents,” said Mr Njogu. The traffic boss asked motorists and motorcycle riders to observe traffic regulations and avoid speeding to minimise accidents.   The Eldoret-Webuye highway has become a death trap especially for pupils at Chimoi Primary School.

The doors of the third largest book fair in world will open to the public on November 1, with more than 1.5 million books on display in Sharjah, the third largest city in the United Arabs Emirates. The 36th edition of the Sharjah International Book Fair, whose theme is “A World Inside My Book”, is expected to attract 1,650 exhibitors from 60 countries. Organisers describe the event as an “11-day celebration of literature, knowledge and culture”. UNITED KINGDOMSouth Korea, Bangladesh and Denmark will be among the countries making their debut appearance. For the first time, the fair will also have a country of honour; the United Kingdom. It was chosen as part of the growing ties between the two countries. “I’m delighted the UK will be the inaugural guest of honour,” British representative to the UAE Hannah Henderson said.

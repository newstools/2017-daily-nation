A six-year-old nursery school boy was on Monday mauled to death by stray dogs on the border of Elgeyo-Marakwet and Uasin Gishu counties. Efforts by a passer-by to rescue the victim were futile. According to Mr Ben Kipchumba, who took the victim to Iten County Referral Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival, the boy was heading to school unaccompanied when the dogs attacked him in Kapsimbol. “I spotted the large number of dogs and I went closer to see what they were up to.  "I thought they were eating an animal but they turned wild when I approached before I noticed they were mauling the boy,” he said, adding that he called for help.  “I borrowed a motorcycle and rushed the boy to hospital. Doctors said he was already dead,” he said. READ: Grandson of Gachagua, 2, mauled by dogs The boy’s father Robert Kibet was undergoing counselling at Iten County Referral hospital.

We are still asking many questions,” he said. Keiyo North veterinary officer Roselyne Bundotich said residents had not reported the stray dogs to authorities.  She said plans to poison stray dogs in various towns and shopping centres in Keiyo North were under way.

JOHANNESBURG Fifa have punished numerous African nations for offences during 2018 World Cup qualifiers last month, the world football body said on Tuesday. Gabon forfeited by a mandatory 3-0 scoreline a match against Ivory Coast in Libreville for fielding suspended midfielder Merlin Tandjigora. However, the Gabonese lost the match 3-0 so the punishment effectively amounted to a $6,200 (Sh620,000) fine. Fielding ineligible players was a major problem in Africa during 2014 World Cup qualifying, but Portugal-based Tandjigora is the first culprit since. Nigeria were fined $30,000 (Sh3 million) after spectators invaded the pitch in Uyo during a 4-0 triumph over Cameroon. The Democratic Republic of Congo must pay Fifa $20,000 (Sh2 million) after the crowd hurled bottles and let off incendiary devices during a 2-2 draw with Tunisia in Kinshasa. Mali were fined $15,000 (Sh1.5 million) because fans flung bottles and chairs on the pitch in a 0-0 stalemate with Morocco in Bamako. The earlier qualifier between the same countries in Rabat led to a $3,000 (Sh300,000) fine for Morocco over whistling while the Malian national anthem was being played. Zambia received a $7,000 (Sh700,000) fine after the crowd hurled various unspecified objects on the pitch during a 3-1 victory over Algeria in Lusaka. Senegal and Burkina Faso were warned for late kick-offs in the qualifiers between them in Dakar and Ouagadougou. The fines are a serious blow as most African national football associations struggle financially with many relying on government bailouts for survival.

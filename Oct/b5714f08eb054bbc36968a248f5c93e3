The National Super Alliance (Nasa) has dismissed Thursday repeat presidential poll as a “Jubilee farce” and shame to Kenya. In a statement read by co-principal Musalia Mudavadi, the opposition alliance on Friday also condemned planned repeat poll in Nyanza. The IEBC plans to hold the election on Saturday in Kisumu, Migori, Homa Bay and Siaya amid opposition from local political, religious and civil society leaders. RAILA Nasa asked the IEBC to call off the poll and accused government of "profiling and targeting" the region for standing with Nasa leader Raila Odinga, who pulled out of the Thursday election. "We read mischief in the move by IEBC to postpone elections only in Nyanza counties. This amounts to ethnic profiling," Mudavadi said. "Why should IEBC force people to participate in an exercise they are not interested in?” asked the ANC party leader. He urged the supporters to keep off polling stations Saturday in order not to be victims of police brutality. "Stay away from the polling stations. Do not go to the streets either because the police are ready to kill," he said. He described the repeat poll as a sham which has now laid bare the tactics of Jubilee Party to shore up their numbers.

Kenya may have missed out on the opportunity to host next year’s African Nations Championship (Chan) football tournament, but all is not lost. In this regard, it is refreshing to note that the Confederation of East and Central African Football Associations (Cecafa), at its executive committee meeting in Khartoum last weekend, awarded Kenya the green light to stage the 12-nation Senior Challenge Cup in November and December. This is an opportunity the government and all stakeholders cannot afford to waste. UNIFYING FACTOR Sports has always proven to be the best unifying factor among Kenyans and the government should use this competition to unify the citizens, especially at this time the country is facing uncertain political times. It is encouraging to note that the county governments of Mombasa, Nakuru and Kakamega have indicated a willingness to host the games. Meanwhile, the government-commissioned renovation of stadiums in Nairobi, Meru and Eldoret should continue. The Football Kenya Federation (FKF) should also put out a quality team and prepare it to win the competition, as was the case in 2013.

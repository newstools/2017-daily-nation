Business returned to normal in Kilifi town a day after the repeat election. Traders at the busy Oloitip Tip market within the market went on with their business unlike on August 8 when tension was high as residents waited for announcement of results. “I have just offloaded my cargo from Mombasa. I am back to my business because life has to continue. We have to move forward after Thursday election,” said Mr Juma Kahindi, a food vendor within the town. PEACE Biashara Street, which remained deserted Thursday was full of activities Friday as clothes and food vendors displayed their wares. Traders said calm in the town shows residents want peace. “We are fine here. There has been a lot of a political activity but one thing which has stood out in this area is the peace. We have remained calm,” said Mr Joseph Nthiga, a businessman in Kilifi town. There was calm in areas which had been deemed as violence hotspot such as Chumani, Mwarakaya, Ngerenya and Dzitsoni. “I choose to remain at home. I voted in August but then there has been a lot of politicking. This to me proved too much to bear. I want to continue with life and fend for my children,” said Chengo Kenga, a resident of Vipingo. VOTES There was a low voter turnout in the county on Thursday. A day before the Thursday elections, police barred Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi from addressing any gathering in the area. On Friday, Kilifi North constituency Returning Officer Abdulwahid Hussein announced the final presidential results for the repeat elections at the Kilimo Primary School tallying centre. President Uhuru Kenyatta got 5,965 votes while opposition leader Raila Odinga got 439 votes.

Coffee farmers are set to benefit from Sh103 billion ($1 billion) partnership deal between Dutch Rabobank and Unep aimed at raising production, processing, volumes and quality of produce. The multinational headquartered in Utrecht, Netherlands, Tuesday said the grant is a three-year initiative pushing for a more sustainable food and agricultural sector. “This new kick-start initiative will see this partnership expand to enable Rabobank Foundation to engage small-holder farmers in production and processing,” said Neumann Kaffe Gruppe/NKG East Africa chief executive Danilo Pucci. Rabobank has had a presence in Kenya since opening a representative office in 2014. “We are now extending our depth of knowledge, skills, networks and financing resources to the entire agricultural sector and food value-chain across the African continent,” said Rabobank Africa chief executive Coert Beerman.

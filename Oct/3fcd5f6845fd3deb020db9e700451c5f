Star Trek is one of those ever present concepts that I hope will never run out of new ways to reinvent itself. On this particular edition of this year’s reboot, TV giant, Netflix, throws a new twist on a different cast in a different world, one that’s far, far away. Michael Burnham is a respected First Officer on the U. S. S. Shenzhou, fearless and logical, as is expected from one with Vulcan upbringing. On one mission, the ship comes across an unidentified object floating around in Federation space. Upon exploration and contact, Michael Burnham encounters a foe that the Starfleet has not seen in decades, and thus her destiny, and decisions thereafter, are changed forever in a tale involving mutiny, treachery, and the drive to survive. I am looking forward to more episodes.

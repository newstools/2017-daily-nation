Two herdsmen who killed a Standard Eight pupil after she refused one man’s sexual advances have been sentenced to death by the High Court in Nanyuki. While passing the sentence, Resident Judge Mary Kasango said Stephen Ntukai and Francis Lukuiye were driven by selfish desires. STABBED The two, now aged 31, were jointly charged with the murder of Nayiiana Yiangere on May 16, 2012 at Kimanjo village in Laikipia North sub-County. The Kimanjo Primary School pupil was stabbed to death. “It was cruel for the two to kill a defenceless 16-year-old girl who was described as an obedient child by her father,” said Justice Kasango. On the day Yiangere was killed, her mother had asked her to collect firewood and she took an axe and nylon sack and headed towards a nearby thicket. MURDER THREATS Her body was discovered the following day, 10 metres from where a passer-by had seen her standing with the two men. Yiangere’s father Mr Kimen Yiangere told the court that Ntukai had threatened to kill his daughter if she continued to resist his romantic overtures. He told the court he had warned Ntukai to stop pursuing his daughter as she was young and still in school. In her judgment, Justice Kasango said the evidence by the prosecution proved that though only one of the accused men was seeking a love relationship with the girl, the two men jointly murdered her.

Day two leader Simon Ngige increased his lead to four shots despite firing two over par 74 in the third round of the 2017 Prime Bank Diani Beach Masters golf tournament at the par 72 Leisure Beach and Golf Resort course in Diani on Friday. Ngige, from Thika Sports Club, got off well picking up an early birdie at the first hole but that was all in that nine, as he bogeyed the sixth, eighth and ninth to finish the front nine on two over par. He managed to get one back at the 11th and later on at the 16th but two bogeys at the 13th and later at the 18th saw him level the back nine for a three-round total of one under par 215. This leaves him with a good chance of claiming the top prize of Sh110,000 unless he plays badly in today’s final round. On the other hand, long hitting Dismas Indiza moved to second place, four shots adrift from Ngige.    Indiza shot level par 72 in the round where he made two bogeys in the opening nine with only a birdie at the fifth while at the back nine, the Mumias Golf Club player birdied the 13th and 17th to close the day with a three-round total of 219. He is capable of producing a low round in the final day where it will be do-or-die affair. Meanwhile, Muthaiga’s Greg Snow was in third place on 221 after a bad 77 for the day where he only birdied the ninth against six bogeys.  He is a shot better, though, than Kopan Timbe who did not have a good day either as he also dropped a number of shots for the day to finish with seven over par.      Only 20 professionals made the second round cut out of the 36 who turned up for the tournament which is featuring the pros for the first time after a number of years.   The pros were joined by amateurs drawn from various clubs in the country on Friday. Leaders after three rounds of the Diani Beach Masters tournament: Simon Ngige 69, 72, 74 = 215 Dismas Indiza 71, 76, 72 = 219 Greg Snow 69, 75, 77 = 221 Kopan Timbe 72, 71, 79 = 222 Jacob Okello 76, 73, 74 =223 Jeff Kubwa 78, 71, 75 = 224 Tony Omuli 73, 73, 79 = 225 Anil Shah 76, 71, 79 = 226 John Wangai 74, 73, 79 = 226 Brian Njoroge 79, 76, 73 = 228

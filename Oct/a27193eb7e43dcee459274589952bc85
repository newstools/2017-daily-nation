The Garissa University College that was attacked by suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists on April 2, 2015 is slowing picking up as more government-sponsored students report to the institution, the principal said on Tuesday. Speaking to the Nation in his office, Prof Ahmed Osman Warfa said that out of the 470 slots given by the government, 277 students have reported to the institution. TERRIFIED Last year only a handful of students under the Kenya University and Colleges Central Placement Services turned up. Prof Warfa said despite security measures undertaken by the government, students have been apprehensive of the institution and have been seeking transfers. “The university is still picking up although whatever happened can’t be forgotten easily. Many students both from government and privately sponsored have been coming to seek admission,” he said. Prof Warfa said the students get worried during power outages, but the university has worked to ensure students are comfortable within the institution. SECURITY ENHANCED The university has a total enrolment of 979, out of which 413 are government-sponsored. The principal urged students who have been posted to the university to come and study as security has been enhanced and there is a police post within the university. “Security has been enhanced tremendously with 24-hour patrols, a perimeter wall, watch towers and restricted access of the institution. Garissa University is now one of the most secure institutions,” said Mr Warfa. On April 2, 2015, hooded gunmen believed to be from the Somalia-based terror group Al-Shabaab stormed the Moi University constituent college, killing at least 148 people, mostly students and security officers. Several others were injured.   The 600 students have refused to go back to the college following the Al-Shabaab attack on Garissa University College.

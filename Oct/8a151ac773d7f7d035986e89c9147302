Starehe MP Charles Njagua, a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, on Friday lost a case to stop Saturday’s rescheduled presidential poll in four counties. Although John Mativo certified urgent two cases against the rescheduled election, the judge failed to issue temporary orders stopping the repeat poll but instead directed the parties to appear before him on October 30 – Monday. BOYCOTT In the first case, Mr Njagua, popularly known as the musician Jaguar, wanted the election in Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori and Siaya counties stopped, arguing that going ahead with the plans will cause confusion. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) rescheduled the repeat presidential election in the four counties after National Super Alliance (Nasa) supporters turned rowdy, and in some instances blocked roads, to stop electoral officials from delivering ballot materials to polling centres for the October 26 election. But Nasa leader Raila Odinga has asked his supporters to stay away from the poll. SABBATH Mr Hesbon Omollo, an SDA member, also moved to the High Court seeking to stop the poll, saying that it was wrong to reschedule it on a Sabbath day. He argued that holding elections on that day would disrupt their worship and church activities and thereby violate their constitutional right and freedoms of worship. “I am apprehensive that the political climate in the four counties is tense with a high likelihood of violent chaos that will potentially cause deaths, injuries, shedding of blood and destruction of property. This would have the effect of desecrating a Sabbath, a day that the SDA faithful hold dear,” Mr Omollo said. He said that when SDA members go to church to worship their God and observe the holy Sabbath, they will be denied a chance to exercise their constitutional right to vote.

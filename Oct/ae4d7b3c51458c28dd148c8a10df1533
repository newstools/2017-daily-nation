Former US football star O.J. Simpson has been freed from on parole after serving nine years for armed robbery and other charges. In July, a parole board in the US state of Nevada voted unanimously to free the 70-year-old Simpson after a tense public hearing broadcast live by news networks. Simpson was convicted on October 2008 of armed robbery, assault, kidnapping and other offenses after he and five associates — two of whom were armed — ambushed the two sports memorabilia dealers in a casino hotel room.

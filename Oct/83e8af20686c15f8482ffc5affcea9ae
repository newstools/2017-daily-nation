Ms Careen Chepchumba, who was found dead in her house on Valentine’s Day 2012, used to be in the company of former TV anchor Louis Otieno on her shopping and weekend dates, a taxi driver told an inquest into her death. Mr Samuel Njuguna Gacheru said Ms Chepchumba was heavily in debt. “On several occasions, I used to pick up Careen and Louis Otieno from her house when she required my services. She had introduced Louis to me as her friend,” Mr Njuguna said. LAST CALLHe told the court he used to run other errands for Ms Chepchumba including picking her parcels from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. It emerged that Mr Njuguna may have been one of the last people to communicate with Ms Chepchumba after he called her on the day she was found dead in her apartment at Santonia Court, Kilimani. “I sent her a text that day, as I had done several days to remind her to pay me. I called her but she did not answer or return my call,” he said. INQUESTMr Njuguna however could not explain a 17-second call that records indicate he made to her number the day she was found dead. “It’s been a long time since then. I cannot remember everything,” he said. He said he later learned about her death from her sister. The inquest continues Wednesday.   Dr Oduor said Ms Chepchumba might have been sexually assaulted by the assailant.

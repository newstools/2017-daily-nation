The Nobel Prize season is here and those who love humanity as much as they esteem the advancement of knowledge are keenly watching who will be this year’s winners. Already, three geneticists have been recognised for their ground-breaking contribution to our understanding of the “biological clock”, which helps us to know when to sleep and when to wake up. Similarly, three physicists have been honoured for their discoveries on gravitational waves and how they affect the earth’s relationship with other objects in the universe. Thursday, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature will be unveiled and very soon, we will know the laureate for the prestigious Peace Prize. INNOVATION These awards celebrate men and women who dedicate their lives to the quest for knowledge and innovation. They also challenge humanity to work for something that will make our world a better place. In our country today, there is too much focus on politics at the expense of sciences and humanities, which have a far greater potential to transform our national life. The leadership must foster a culture of creativity and innovation. Although Kenya is proud to have produced a Peace Prize laureate, Prof Wangari Maathai, another win would inspire young Kenyans who will have yet a new role model. But such recognition will only come if we invest more in the quest for knowledge and innovation.

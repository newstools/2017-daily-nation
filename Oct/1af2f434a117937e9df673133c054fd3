Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association Super League reigning champions, Stray Lions will on Sunday host Kanbis at Peponi School, Ruiru.  The Lions lie second on the league table with 186 points from 10 outings, four points behind Kanbis who top the table with 190 points.  Sunday’s game is expected to be explosive as each team is fighting hard to lift the league trophy. The Lions’ dependable batsman, Collins Obuya, a former national team captain is enjoying good form with the bat and has become a match winner for Lions. Nehemiah Odhiambo, who joined the Lions this season from Swamibapa, shone with the ball against his former team last Sunday. As for Kanbis, Kenya's skipper Rakep Patel, Dhiren Gondaria and Nelson Odhiambo are all capable of winning the game for their team. Therefore, when the two umpires take up their positions, the whole Peponi ground will be set aflame.  Swamibapa (154 points) will travel to Park Road to face Obuya Academy (73 points) at Sir Ali Muslim Club. Swamibapa cannot afford to lose if they are to maintain any hopes of dislodging both the Lions and Kanbis from their current positions on the league table.  Swamibapa is the strongest team, at least on paper, as they have the bulk of both current and former national team players in the side, who include Morris Ouma, Lameck Onyango, Jadavji Bhimji, Elijah Otieno, Irfan Karim and Alex Obanda. Obuya Academy was promoted to Super League this season and are currently lying seventh on the table.  Elsewhere, Sikh Union (122) will host Cutchi Leva (43); Nairobi Gymkhana (91) will be home to Kongonis (43) and Ruaraka (78) will host Sir Ali Muslim Club (72).

President Uhuru Kenyatta has claimed Opposition leader Raila Odinga wants to withdraw from October 26 repeat presidential race in order to cause anarchy. During an address to Coast leaders in Mombasa on Monday, the President challenged Mr Odinga to quit if he is not ready to participate in the race.  He further said that Mr Odinga is putting hurdles to the October 26 poll so that it does not happen. NASA DEMANDS  The Head of State cited Nasa demands including, changes in the electoral commission, a new printer of the presidential ballot papers, claims of Safaricom involvement in irregularities in last August polls and attacks on Parliament as clues indicating that Mr Odinga does not want to participate in the repeat vote. “He (Mr Odinga) is free to withdraw from the race if he is not interested. Kenyans must be allowed to move forward,” President Kenyatta said. He said he did not know the reasons Mr Odinga will give when he announces that he is leaving the race “because he is full of excuses.” “Kenyans are tired and want to move forward. If he (Mr Odinga) does not want elections he should keep off and let the country move forward,” President Kenyatta who is on a three-day tour of the Coast region that started on Sunday said. CAMPAIGN The President said about Sh12 billion had been set aside for the repeat polls and that Kenyans were ready for the exercise. He said Jubilee Party had started its campaigns and will do a door to door drive before the poll. While speaking at the same event Deputy President William Ruto said the Jubilee administration will not accept to share power with the National Super Alliance. The DP accused Nasa leader Raila Odinga of wanting to make the country ungovernable so as to force the formation of a power-sharing government. “Power sharing government is unconstitutional. What we know is for Kenyans to decide through the ballot,” Mr Ruto said.

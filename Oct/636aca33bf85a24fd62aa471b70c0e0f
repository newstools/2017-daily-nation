The repeat presidential poll failed to kick off at Rera DOK Primary School polling station in Kitutu Chache South Constituency, Kisii County after the presiding officer and all clerks resigned. Kisii County Police Commander Abdi Hassan said the officers mandated to conduct the repeat poll tendered their resignation on Thursday at 8.30am. “They cited security fears saying their lives were in danger,” he said. The polling station, which is in Bogisero Ward along the Luo-Kisii border  has 297 registered voters. According to Mr Hassan, the officials may have feared attacks from the neighbouring Homa Bay County. POSTPONED “They said there was rising tension in the region and (they) did not want to be exposed to danger,”  he said. Homa Bay is one of the four counties where IEBC postponed the repeat poll after residents engaged security officers in running battles for the better part of the day. Others are Kisumu, Migori and Siaya. While postponing the polls to Saturday IEBC chairman said: “Security is not in the hands of the commission. We were promised security by the Inspector-General of Police and the government agencies  and once we get feedback from them we shall be able to see how we can manage the movement of materials and the security of our officers in the affected counties.”

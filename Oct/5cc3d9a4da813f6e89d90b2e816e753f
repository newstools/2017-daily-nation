It’s encouraging that decisive steps have been taken by police in the investigation of an incident in Nairobi in which a prominent businessman’s son was shot dead. Following an initial denial of involvement in the fatal incident, there is hope now that the public will get to know what actually transpired. And that there will be no attempts to cover up the matter. All the 12 officers who conducted an operation at the city home, are effectively under investigation. The confirmation that they have been ordered to surrender their guns for examination is reassuring. We hope that the findings will be made public as soon as possible, and if any is found culpable, then the law and the service’s regulations should be strictly followed. SECURITY Indeed, this is a difficult time for the police, as the service is overstretched, what with having to provide security as the political conflict over the coming fresh presidential poll presents a monumental challenge. The swift move against the officers is a confirmation that the service means well and has no sacred cows within it. In such security operations, where the officers also put their lives on the line, errors of judgment can happen. But when they occur, a substantive explanation must be given and culprits, if any, punished. For now, the officers investigating the killing should be given time to wrap it up as swiftly and efficiently as possible.

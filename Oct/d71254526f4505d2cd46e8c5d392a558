Screenshots have emerged revealing what went down in Hollywood in June between Comedian Vincent Muasya aka Chipukeezy who went on National television and lied about the way he met American comedian Kevin Hart. Speaking exclusively to Showbuzz, Christine Wawira, a Hollywood actor, narrated how the Kenyan comedian never even got to attend the BET Awards ceremony. “So you know how Chipukeezy met Kevin Hart and went to the BET awards? Well I’m the one who got him connected with meeting Kevin. But in his interviews he lied and said a white woman saw his stand-up routine clips and hooked him up with Kevin Hart,” said Wawira. She also went ahead and shared the conversation between them, and how Chipukeezy apologised for claiming that Ms Wawira was the white woman in his story. “I was just trying to save my image girl,” read the message where Chipukeezy replied to Wawira after she asked him why he lied. “Kenyan media was trying to tell my story of why and how I met Kevin. Everyone was saying that I flew all the way to come and take a picture to be a groupie etc etc, it was looking bad for me. So I decided to change the story and told it my way. Am sorry for disappointing you but I had to protect my brand girl. Am sorry,” added Chipukeezy. According to Wawira, Chipukeezy never attended the BET awards.  “I invited him to come with me but he decided to trust someone else who ended up disappointing him and he couldn’t get access to the show,” she told Showbuzz. She added that, Chipukeezy asked her to text him videos which she had taken at the awards from the third row at the show and he posted them saying he was there.  “He has lied to millions of people and it makes me sad,” concludes Ms Wawira.

Tumbling in for Brookside's Kenyatta Cup confection, was none other than El Mundo (Charles Njenga), who wrote a solitary composition, dismantling anything that dared to swipe his oxygen.  Talk about a whitewash. El Mundo cleaned the deck by 9 sassy lengths from Knighthood, Caen, and, Manzhouli. Notorious could not generate any speed, confirming staunch priorities as a stayer. Peter Wesonga from Brookside, presented the Kenyatta Cup to Yogi Patel, assisted by Jockey Club Directors, Joe Muya and Margaret Shava. Flash Harrry (Julie McCann), referred everyone in the Vicky Jackman Memorial Cambric Cup feature, to lesser births, as this duo set an impressionistic passage from ground zero. Blue Arrow just had to gaze forlornly at Flash Harry's Bazooka like dexterity. Bulawayo was right out of depth, surfing distant waves with Espionage.  Compliments to trainer, Stewart McCann, on his inaugural winner, for a sizable syndication.   NGONG RESULTS 1.05 pm - First Race - Brookside Handicap (1,800m) 1. April's Song (Paul Kiarie) 2.

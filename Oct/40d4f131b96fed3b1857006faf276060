A bus full of passengers, who were travelling to Lokichar in Turkana County is stuck in the middle of a flooded river. At least 14 passengers have climbed to the roof while the fate of others is unknown. In a statement, the National Disaster Management Unit (NDMU) Communications Director Pius Masai said the Eldoret Express Bus was heading to Lokichar when the driver tried to cross a seasonal river at Kalomorok. He said the police are unable to reach the passenger due to strong currents. “OCS Kainuk Police Station and his officers are at the scene but cannot access the passengers due to the strong current,” he said.

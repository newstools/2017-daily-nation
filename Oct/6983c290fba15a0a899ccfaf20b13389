More police officers have been deployed to Migori County even after the repeat election was cancelled. Lorries ferrying the officers arrived at the county headquarters Saturday. Sources said the additional officers are from Nyamira, Kisii and Bomet counties. At the same time, Kenya Red Cross has set up a blood donation centre in Migori town. Residents have been asked to go to Posta grounds to donate blood to help victims, who were shot and injured during protests. On Thursday, protesters blocked roads in Migori to prevent transportation of election materials into the county. They stepped up their efforts to ensure Saturday repeat presidential election, as ordered by the electoral commission in Nyanza, does not take place in Migori County. After staging demos all day Thursday, unknown demonstrators spent the night blocking entry and exit from the border county via road. They went as far as welding girders across the main highway linking Migori town to Tanzania, in an attempt to prevent any delivery of voting material in the county.

Autopsy on the body of Hillcrest Preparatory School head teacher who was murdered on Thursday morning in Karen shows that the bullet punctured her lungs. Gabrielle Maina was shot at around 10.30 am as she returned to her home after dropping her son at a friend’s home. Government Pathologist, Johansen Oduor who conducted the postmortem on the body of the Australia born woman, said that the bullet discharged at close range entered through the left side of her neck and exited through the right side of her back. MURDER “The single shot punctured her lung and caused a lot of internal bleeding. Both her lungs collapsed,” Dr Oduor said at the Lee Funeral Home, where the body of the teacher is being preserved. Dr Oduor said the body had no other injury caused by any other object. A detective privy to the investigations into the daylight murder of the mother of two, said the police were pursuing leads that would help in the arrest of the killers, who used a motorcycle for the mission. Investigators are banking on an armature clip shot using a mobile phone by a motorist who was also driving along Warai Road where the teacher was murdered. Karen OCPD, Cunnigham Suiyanka said Ms Maina was shot by men on a motorcycle. Her killers took her mobile phone and her purse. Ms Maina’s body is scheduled for cremation on Wednesday at the Lang'ata crematorium.   Gabrielle Maina killed as she walked on Miotoni Road in Karen.

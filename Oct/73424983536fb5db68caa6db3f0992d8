Kenyan rapper Nyashinski was feted by Coke Studio Africa on Sunday night, as a viewing party was held in his honour at Kiza Lounge along Galana Road.  The rapper, who was part of Coke Studio Africa 2017, has been nominated for the Best African Act category at the MTV European Music Awards (MTV EMAs). The “Mungu Pekee” rapper’s first episode on the show that fosters music collaborations between African acts joined Coke Studio on October 22, after he was nominated early this year for the MTV award.  He collaborated with decorated South African group Mafikizolo, doing a cover of their renowned dance hit “Khona” while they did one on his love ballad “Malaika”. Later on, they combined to put together an original song produced by South African beats-maker, Sketchy Bongo. Nyashinski also took this time to thank fans and believers in his music for the support they have shown him since he came back into the music scene as well as those who have picked up the rally call from him to get as many votes cast to try and get him the award.  Voting for the MTV EMAs is still ongoing and will close at midnight of November 10 CET (1 am EAT). Nyashinski is up against Nigerian global heavyweights Wizkid and Davido.  One can vote for their favourite artiste as many times as they are able to.  Sauti Sol won the category back in 2014 by beating out Davido and Tanzania’s Diamond Platnumz, among others.

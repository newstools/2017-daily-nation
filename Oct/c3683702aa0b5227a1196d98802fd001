Kenya coach Moses Epoloto is hopeful that his “inexperienced” charges will pick lessons from their inconsistent display at the volleyball Men’s Africa Nations Championship in Egypt that ended last week. Epoloto oversaw a 3:3 win-loss ratio for the team in their six engagements that saw them finish 10th out of the 14 nations that participated in the continental championship at the Cairo Sports Complex. “I can refer to this as a learning experience for the players. At times it was a frustrating one because we could play so well in one set and then dramatically collapse in the next one,” said Epoloto, who is also attached to top flight side General Service Unit. “This is a sign of lacking experience and we can only improve.” The team received support from the Kenya Volleyball Federation. “The squad’s average squad is 21. All the players save for Mike Chemos have never played outside the country,” said the federation first vice-chairman Martin Makokha. “We disbanded the other team because the veterans like Phillip Maiyo, James Ontere, Dennis Mokua and Elisha Aliwa were not performing. We have now formed this new team and are trying to expose them before we start demanding results.” OPENING GROUP GAME Kenya suffered early elimination from the competition after losing 3-0 to Ghana (25-16, 26-24, 25-14) and Tunisia (25-16, 25-19, 25-22) in their opening Group B games. The team recovered to defeat seasoned Libya 3-2 (16-25, 20-25, 25-21, 25-21, 15-12) in the final group match before easily beating Chad and Nigeria in the classification matches.  Kenya however ended the tournament with a straight sets defeat to Ghana in the position 9/10 play-off on Saturday.

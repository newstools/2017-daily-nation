One of the most fascinating things this week is that there is something to celebrate amid the gloom and doom that has been shadowing the country with ugly fights between rival politicians. As the National Super Alliance protesters and their rivals were flexing their muscles in the streets of Nairobi and other towns, a Kenyan woman was being recognised internationally for her contribution to peacemaking. It’s ironical, isn’t it? Ms Alice Wairimu Nderitu is one of the recipients of the inaugural Global Pluralism Award that recognises people “who have made extraordinary achievements in peacebuilding, mediation and pluralism”. She has been feted as a mediator to armed conflict in Nigeria and Kenya, working with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue. HATE SPEECH Incidentally, Ms Nderitu previously worked with the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, which has done pretty little to tame hate speech and incitement to violence by politicians. Elections always bring out the worst in Kenyans as is evident in the run-up to the fresh presidential election on October 26. We hope the protagonists in the ugly standoff that is once again pushing the country to the brink of conflict and resultant violence will pause and reflect on what the achievement of one Kenyan on the global scene means for the entire country. There is absolutely no reason why the Jubilee Party leader, President Uhuru Kenyatta, and his arch-rival, Nasa’s Raila Odinga, cannot bridge the worsening national divide, and yet they often meet and heartily chat with each other.

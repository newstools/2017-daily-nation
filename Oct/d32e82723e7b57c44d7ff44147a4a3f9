Two suspected thieves were gunned down by police in Narok Town after they attempted to rob a supermarket. Narok police boss Joseph Kiasompe said the two were in a gang of four during the 9pm incident. "The police were trucking down the gang for the whole day and cornered them as they tried to rob the supermarket at total estate," Mr Kisombe said. He said a toy pistol was seized from one of the gangsters. Their accomplices escaped.

A police officer has denied that he defiled a 13-year-old girl inside a cell in Murang'a as the Director of Public Prosecutions dropped theft charges against the minor. Mr Laban Njogu, who appeared before Chief Magistrate Margret Wachira also denied a charge of committing an indecent act with a minor. The court heard that Mr Njogu, attached to the Murang'a Police Station, committed the offence on September 30 while the minor was remanded at the police station. INTERFERE His application to be released on bond was objected by the prosecutor, Mr Solomon Njeru, who argued that the accused might interfere with investigations. The magistrate will deliver the ruling on bond on Wednesday and directed that the suspect be remanded at Murang'a GK Prison. Mr Njeru applied for the withdrawal of the case against the girl saying she was at risk given that she is also a complainant against the police, who are supposed to protect her. The prosecutor told the court that the girl is at risk at the Murang’a Juvenile Remand Home, where she is was remanded. WITHDRAW “The State wishes to withdraw the case against the minor. If she was molested at the hands of police, the same case may happen while at the remand home,” he said. He also urged the court to consider that the minor is a Kenya Certificate of Primary Education candidate. Mr Njeru also applied that the minor be put under the supervision of the Child Welfare society, a rescue center, since she had ran from home two weeks before her arrest. The magistrate dropped the charges against the minor but the case against her co accused, Mr John Mwangi, will proceed. The two were charged with stealing and handling stolen goods. Mr Kang’ata has offered to cater for counselling for the minor saying she has been traumatised by the ordeal.   Laban Maina Njogu fails to plead as prosecution asked for more time to conclude investigations.

Safaricom’s revelation that it sacked 52 employees involved in fraud in just one year is a response to a disturbing trend for corporate Kenya. Equally unsettling is the disclosure that the number of those dismissed rose from 36 in the previous financial year. Yet the telecoms operator is one of the few companies that take governance seriously and is courageous enough to make it public. The corporate sector is beset with rampant fraud and corruption, whose combined impact on the economy is huge. In recent months, a number of banks, retail chains and even airlines have go down in circumstances related to graft without any serious consequences for the culprits. CRIMINALS Many private firms cover up for corporate criminals, who then use their loot to buy political office. Going public marks a crucial step in fighting graft. Safaricom deserves a pat on the back. The same could be said of KCB, which in March, sacked 31 employees in a crackdown on fraud. These small steps are needed to improve our image as an investment destination. Blaming public sector corruption for raising the cost of doing business when private firms aren’t doing enough to rid their ranks of it makes is a case of the kettle calling the pot black. We need to see more in a country where banks alone lost Sh500 billion in fraud last December alone.

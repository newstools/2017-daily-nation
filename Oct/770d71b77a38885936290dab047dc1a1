The Ministry of Sports, Culture and the Arts should live up to its promise, made on Tuesday, that it would pay all outstanding allowances to officials and contractors who provided services during the IAAF World Under-18 Championships that Nairobi hosted in July. Officials at the ministry made the pledge after protests from members of various sub-committees in the championships’ Local Organising Committee who ensured that Kenya hosted memorable games. However, despite the assurances, no payments have come through even after the National Treasury said it had released money. DRAGS PROGRAMMES It is such red tape by public officials that drags down Kenya’s sports programmes. That no officials are punished for failing to perform their duties only fuels the recalcitrance in the sports docket, including Kenya’s failure to host the CHAN tournament. Unless work ethic at the sports ministry changes, and until errant officials are punished, the future of sport will continue to bear the brunt of impunity.

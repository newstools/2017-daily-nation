Five people were injured when suspected Al-Shabaab militants sprayed their vehicle with bullets between Bodhei and Ijara, on the border of Lamu and Garissa counties. The 2pm Saturday incident happened close to where the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) killed five Al-Shabaab terrorists and recovered six AK-47 assault rifles, 321 rounds of ammunition, three grenades and explosives on October 9. On Saturday, Boni Enclave Campaign Director Joseph Kanyiri said the militants were hiding in the bushes. Boni Enclave was formerly known as Linda Boni Operation.

"The Probox was en route to Ijara with five passengers, mostly Muslim women who were escorting a bride to a wedding ceremony. "They sustained serious gunshot wounds and were rushed to nearby hospitals by our gallant soldiers. "Our officers are already pursuing the perpetrators in Boni forest, particularly at Bodhei, Ijara and the surrounding areas," Mr Kanyiri said. TERRORISMMr Kanyiri warned Al-Shabaab sympathizers that they will "be dealt with", urging them to supply police with information that could lead to the arrest of criminals. He said lack of cooperation between security agencies and the locals is a major challenge in the war on terrorism and radicalization. Mr Kanyiri said the security agencies fighting the terror group will not relent.

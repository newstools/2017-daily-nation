Telkom Kenya has unveiled a new data package that grants subscribers free calls and Whatsapp within its own network and free SMSes across all local networks. The package dubbed "Freedom bundles" also enables Telkom subscribers to make calls to other networks at Sh2 per minute. Subscribers must, however, have a valid "Freedom" bundle and a data balance of not less than 1MB to enjoy the service. “We continue to monitor and review our customer experience, to make it more engaging and superior in quality. We will also continue to develop communication solutions that meet the productivity and lifestyle needs of our growing subscriber base. 'Stress-free' "The Freedom bundle can best be described as a stress-free offering that allows our customers more flexibility and choice, while using our services,” said Telkom’s Chief Executive Officer Aldo Mareuse. “With this service, they can turn their mobile phones into fully functional personal integrated communication devices.” The products enables Telkom subscribers to purchase a monthly 10GB (gigabyte) bundle at Sh1,999, a weekly 200MB bundle at Sh99, and a daily 100MB bundle at Sh39.

Police are holding a 31-year-old man, who posted on social media messages calling for the shooting of people during anti-IEBC demonstrations. The suspect posted the messages on Facebook, accompanied by a picture of himself holding an AK47 rifle saying he would “take down as many people as possible” during the protests. Detectives arrested Mr David Ochieng Omondi in Githurai, Nairobi. National Police Service Spokesperson George Kinoti confirmed the arrested and warned that anyone found posing hate or inflammatory statements on social media will face the law. Police on Wednesday asked the court to allow them to detain him for 15 days before they prefer charges against him. They told the court that they require time to conclude investigations. During a raid at the suspect’s home, police recovered three rounds of 9mm ammunition, commonly used in pistols.
